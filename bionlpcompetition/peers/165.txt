 (1991) Neuropathological changes in Scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of Apolipoprotein E and Cathepsin D in astrocytes.  AD, Alzheimer's disease; ApoE, apolipoprotein E; APOE, apolipoprotein E gene; APP, [beta]-amyloid precursor protein; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.   (1991) Neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of Apolipoprotein E and Cathepsin D in astrocytes.  Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.   (1991) Neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of apolipoprotein E and cathepsin D in astrocytes.  While the [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) is widely accepted as a major genetic risk factor for the late onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence points to variations in ApoE levels as another important factor.   Dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase 1 (DCP1) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) gene interactions with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele as risk factors in Alzheimer's disease and in Parkinson's disease with coexisting Alzheimer pathology.   and the French Alzheimer's disease collaborative group (1995) Evidence for apolipoprotein E [epsis]4 association in early-onset Alzheimer's patients with late-onset relatives.

ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been linked to maladies such as hypercholesterolemia, CNS injury and disease.
