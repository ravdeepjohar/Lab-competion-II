Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a plasma protein with known functions in cholesterol transport and metabolism and Alzheimer's disease.   To date, four genes have been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes including the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (1-4), the presenilin-1 gene on chromosome 14 (5), the presenilin-2 gene on chromosome 1 (6-7), and the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) 1 gene on chromosome 19 (8-10).   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Background Recent studies of the relationship between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome have revealed inconsistent results.   (1997) Increased plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels in Alzheimer's disease.  Apolipoprotein E in Down's syndrome The relation of APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome has been difficult to establish.  The [epsis]4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), one of the main allele of APOE polymorphism, is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease.   (1997) Increased plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) levels in Alzheimer's disease.  The presence of at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is a major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).
