(1999) The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the Hypocretin (Orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   (1999) The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   The sleep disorder canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 gene.   Mignot's group (38) identified, through linkage analysis and positional cloning, mutations in the orexin 2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy, an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy.
