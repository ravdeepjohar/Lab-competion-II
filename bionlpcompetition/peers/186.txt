Mutations of presenilin 1 (PS1) causing Alzheimer's disease selectively increase the secretion of the amyloidogenic ssA4(1-42), whereas knocking out the gene results in decreased production of both ssA4(1-40) and (1-42) amyloid peptides (De Strooper et al.

(1995) Mutations of the Presenilin-1 gene in families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).   Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).   On the other hand, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by point mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (8), in the presenilin 2 (PS2)1 gene on chromosome 1 (9-11), or, most frequently, in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (12-15).  6 The Alzheimer's Disease Collaborative Group (1995) The structure of the presenilin I gene and the identification of six mutations in early onset AD pedigrees.
