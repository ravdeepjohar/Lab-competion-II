In vitro pharmacologic restoration of CFTR-mediated chloride transport with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate in cystic fibrosis epithelial cells containing F508-CFTR.   In vitro pharmacologic restoration of CFTR-mediated chloride transport with sodium 4-phenylbutyrate in cystic fibrosis epithelial cells containing F508-CFTR.   Defective CFTR function disrupts ion transport, which is believed to contribute to the clinical sequelae characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (49, 58, 67, 74).  Culturing airway epithelial cells with most of the apical media removed (air-liquid interface) has been shown to enhance cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated Cl secretory current.   Subsequent studies, however, failed to repeat this initial finding and, moreover, revealed that adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis airways was limited by the local immune response associated with multiple vector administrations.
