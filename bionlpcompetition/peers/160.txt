 One wonders what caustic comments would have come from Shaw s critical pen about the factors that led to  mad cow disease  or even sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which may be a byproduct of an expanding animal to human interface in a setting of unhygienic livestock breeding for commercial purposes.   The SARS epidemic and mad cow disease confronted us with new, potentially lethal diseases and with the dangers of forcing nature in order to increase food production [2].   Although the epidemic of "mad cow disease" has brought this field to the headlines, its scientific excitement rests more on the notion that altered protein conformations can impart disease and the somewhat revolutionary concepts of infection and heredity that have come out of this work.   New variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) of humans is probably caused by consumption of BSE-infected materials ( mad cow" disease).   In Britain, thousands rioted against the poll tax, and a government minister fed his daughter a beefburger on television to counter rumours of mad cow disease.   The field of protein folding was gaining followers as a host of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and mad cow disease, were found to be mediated by misshapen proteins.   It has been established that both codons 108 and 189 control TSE incubation time, and that each polymorphism plays a distinct role in the disease process.   In mice, scrapie incubation time is controlled by polymorphisms at PrP codons 108 (leucine or phenylalanine) and 189 (threonine or valine), but the precise role of each polymorphism in the control of disease is unknown.
