 One wonders what caustic comments would have come from Shaw s critical pen about the factors that led to  mad cow disease  or even sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which may be a byproduct of an expanding animal to human interface in a setting of unhygienic livestock breeding for commercial purposes.   In Mad Cow Disease and Related Spongiform Encephalopathies, pp.  Since PrP has a central role in TSE disease, the Prnp and Prnd genes are in close proximity and the proteins share a structural similarity, it has been proposed that Dpl might also play a role in TSE disease.   New variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) of humans is probably caused by consumption of BSE-infected materials ( mad cow" disease).   In Britain, thousands rioted against the poll tax, and a government minister fed his daughter a beefburger on television to counter rumours of mad cow disease.   The central role of PrP in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), the proximity of the gene which encodes doppel (Prnd) to the PrP gene (Prnp) and the structural similarity shared by PrP and doppel have led to the proposition that ataxia which develops during TSE disease could, in part, be due to doppel.   The field of protein folding was gaining followers as a host of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and mad cow disease, were found to be mediated by misshapen proteins.   The SARS epidemic and mad cow disease confronted us with new, potentially lethal diseases and with the dangers of forcing nature in order to increase food production [2].
