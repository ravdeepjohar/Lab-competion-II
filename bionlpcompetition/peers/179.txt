 Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein (9), HNF3 (10), HNF4 (11), C/EBP (12), and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 (13).   However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR.  The accessory factors HNF4, COUP-TF, and HNF3 are required for maximal induction of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids (13, 28-32), and each interacts with the coactivator SRC1 through exactly the same regions required for their AF function (this paper and Refs.  Direct Recruitment of a Coactivator, GAL4-SRC1, Can Replace the AF Function of HNF4 or COUP-TF at gAF1-- Previous studies of the PEPCK gene GRU show that each gAF element is specifically required and that a precise organization of these elements in the GRU is necessary for a full glucocorticoid response (28, 37).   As MODY1 patients are not born with diabetes and initially have no measurable abnormal function in the ss-cells of the pancreas, it seem unlikely that the mutated HNF4 is deficient in a specific function such as interaction with COUP-TF (46).  The abbreviations used are: HBV, hepatitis B virus; TR4, testicular receptor 4; HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 ; DR, direct repeat; RXR, retinoid X receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ; TR2, testicular receptor 2; C mRNA, core mRNA; pre-C mRNA, pre-core mRNA; C, core; HRE, hormone response element; COUP-TF1, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor 1; VDR, vitamin D receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase.
