 Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein (9), HNF3 (10), HNF4 (11), C/EBP (12), and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 (13).   However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR.   By this model, AFs such as HNF4, COUP-TF1, and HNF3 would serve to recruit SRC1, which in turn is only activated by the additional presence of ligand bound GR.   As MODY1 patients are not born with diabetes and initially have no measurable abnormal function in the ss-cells of the pancreas, it seem unlikely that the mutated HNF4 is deficient in a specific function such as interaction with COUP-TF (46).   These data demonstrate that TR4 can function as a repressor in liver cells to suppress HBV gene expression and replication.   Protein-protein interactions and synergies with other transcription factors such as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) (16) and nuclear transcription factor Y (NPY) (17) or with coactivators of the p160 family (18, 19) and the CREB binding protein (CBP) (19, 20, 21, 22) enhance the transcriptional activity of HNF4.       DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The data presented here provide the first insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of COUP-TFI in neurogenesis and suggest a major function for COUP-TFI in the regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.
