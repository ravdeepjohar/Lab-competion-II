 ssL1 and ssL3, together with L2 and the C terminus of the ss-subunit, form one end of the heterodimer, extending beyond the area where the two subunits interact (Figs.   However, ectopic expression of HPV16 L1 and L2 in BPHE-1 cells via infection with recombinant defective Semliki Forest viruses results in the generation of infectious HPV16 pseudovirions containing the BPV genome within capsids formed of HPV16 L1 and L2 (22).   Production of viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2) expressed from the late gene (L1 and L2) is restricted to the most terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the upper layers of the epithelium.   The closed, circular genome of ~8000 base pairs codes for only 10 proteins: eight early proteins termed E1-E8 and two late proteins, L1 and L2, that make up the viral coat (2).   It also strongly suggests that a competent lesion is only formed when L1 and L2 physically interact on the cell surface, which, by definition, describes a MAC.    The structure of the CCNL1 gene resembles that of CCNL2, and there are alternative splicing variants of cyclin L1 that result in a long and a short form of the protein (41, 39), similar to cyclin L2 and cyclin L2S.   Gene transfer using recombinant rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus capsids with genetically modified DNA encapsidation capacity by addition of packaging sequences from L1 or L2 protein of human papillomavirus type 16.   Their viral capsids are 50 to 55 nm in diameter and contain 72 pentamers of the major structural L1 protein (capsomers) centred on the vertices of a T=7 icosahedral lattice (Baker et al.
