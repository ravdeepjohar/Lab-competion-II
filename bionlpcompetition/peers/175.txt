  The structure of the CCNL1 gene resembles that of CCNL2, and there are alternative splicing variants of cyclin L1 that result in a long and a short form of the protein (41, 39), similar to cyclin L2 and cyclin L2S.   sensory organs form on the L1 and L3 veins, but not on the L2, L4 or L5 veins).   It also strongly suggests that a competent lesion is only formed when L1 and L2 physically interact on the cell surface, which, by definition, describes a MAC.   2) and indicates that Y270A maintains a DNA-encapsidation capacity proportional to the low amounts of capsid assembled, whereas D273A does form normal amounts of empty capsids but has a severely impaired ability to encapsidate the viral genome.   Self-assembly of human papillomavirus type 1 capsids by expression of the L1 protein alone or by coexpression of the L1 and L2 capsid proteins.   Overall, the small ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes and dN/dS values indicate that E1, L1 and L2 are under strong purifying selection, forming a functional core essential to the viral life cycle.   Each pair contains the anticipated PV ORFs, including the E6 and E7 proteins, the replication proteins (E1 and E2) and components of the viral capsid (L1 and L2).  The typical HPV genome contains six open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the structural proteins (L1 and L2), proteins that mediate the viral life cycle (E1 and E2) and proteins that regulate host-cell DNA replication and transformation (E6 and E7) (Knipe et al.   ssL1 and ssL3, together with L2 and the C terminus of the ss-subunit, form one end of the heterodimer, extending beyond the area where the two subunits interact (Figs.
