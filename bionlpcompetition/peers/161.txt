 (2000) Role of elevated amyloid ss protein in patients with typical late onset Alzheimer's disease.   The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission.   Recent studies have supported a role for IDE in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease, two conditions characterized by amyloid.   (2004) Genetic variants in a haplotype block spanning IDE are significantly associated with plasma Ass42 levels and risk for Alzheimer's disease.   Since IDE is one of the A-clearing enzymes, it is tempting to increase its activity to lower the amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease patients.   (2001) Role of apoe/Abeta interactions in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.   A major contribution of longitudinal studies to date has been that of the role of vascular disease in risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease.   Further studies have suggested that IDE plays a role in the control of extracellular levels of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide (13, 16).   Recently, IDE was implicated in the degradation of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide (11, 12).   (1997) The role of heredity in late-onset Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.   Although several neural substrates may mediate exercise-induced effects on neuronal structure and integrity, research suggests a central role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (4, 46), and levels of this factor in the hippocampi are diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (47).
