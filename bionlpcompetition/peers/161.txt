 The role of these drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will become apparent with continued clinical practice influenced by an appropriate audit of their use and benefit to patients.   (1997) The role of heredity in late-onset Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.   Since IDE is one of the A-clearing enzymes, it is tempting to increase its activity to lower the amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease patients.   Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.   The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission.   Although several neural substrates may mediate exercise-induced effects on neuronal structure and integrity, research suggests a central role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (4, 46), and levels of this factor in the hippocampi are diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (47).   (1997) The role of oestrogen in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.   Because of increased public awareness of advances in genetics and the efforts of advocacy groups in explaining the latest research findings, relatives of people with Alzheimer's disease are increasingly asking the question, "What is my risk and what is my children's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease?".   These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
