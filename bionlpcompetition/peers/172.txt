Although epidemiologic and biochemical data suggest a role for p53 in mediating apoptosis and cancer in FA, a previous study found that a dominant-negative p53 did not affect apoptosis in FANCC-deficient, immortalized lymphoblasts exposed to genotoxic stress.   Gamma-ray-induced apoptosis in transgenic mice with proliferative abnormalities in their intestinal epithelium: re-entry of villus enterocytes into the cell cycle does not affect their radioresistance but enhances the radiosensitivity of the crypt by inducing p53.   Furthermore, the failure of Mdm2 to affect p53-I in terms of apoptosis and transrepression is consistent with the inability of Mdm2 to bind p53-I.   p53 must be able to function as a transcription factor to block the G1-S transition, but p53-mediated apoptosis does not necessarily require transcriptional activation, because inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or translation by cycloheximide does not always affect p53-dependent apoptosis (30, 54).   Several variables, such as the extent of DNA damage and the levels of p53, also affect the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (58).   Oligomycin does not affect p53-independent apoptosis signaling.   Mutations in the p53 DNA binding domain or certain mutations in the nuclear localization signal and tetramerization domain that indirectly affect DNA binding abrogate or diminish p53 activity in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1, 5).    Oligomycin does not affect p53-independent apoptosis signaling.   Similar experiments on MG-63 cells showed that p53 did not affect apoptosis induced by PTTG (Fig.  Expression of p202 Decreases the Rate of p53-induced Apoptosis-- To investigate how the decrease in the basal levels of p202, after the physiological increases in the levels of p53, affect p53-induced apoptosis, we overexpressed p202 in murine Vm10 cell line.
