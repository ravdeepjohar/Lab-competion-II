 Gamma-ray-induced apoptosis in transgenic mice with proliferative abnormalities in their intestinal epithelium: re-entry of villus enterocytes into the cell cycle does not affect their radioresistance but enhances the radiosensitivity of the crypt by inducing p53.   p53 must be able to function as a transcription factor to block the G1-S transition, but p53-mediated apoptosis does not necessarily require transcriptional activation, because inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or translation by cycloheximide does not always affect p53-dependent apoptosis (30, 54).   Mutations in the p53 DNA binding domain or certain mutations in the nuclear localization signal and tetramerization domain that indirectly affect DNA binding abrogate or diminish p53 activity in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1, 5).   Similar experiments on MG-63 cells showed that p53 did not affect apoptosis induced by PTTG (Fig.  How p53 mediates apoptosis has been a matter of intensive study since this was first demonstrated (Yonish-Rouach et al.    Oligomycin does not affect p53-independent apoptosis signaling.  How does this novel domain mediate an apoptotic activity? Previously, it was shown that p53(Gln22-Ser23), which cannot activate several cellular p53 targets (9, 14, 22, 31, 43), is still capable of inducing apoptosis (9, 31, 34), and a p53 mutant, which lacks the proline-rich region, is capable of activating several p53 targets (33, 34) but cannot induce apoptosis (33, 34).   Furthermore, the failure of Mdm2 to affect p53-I in terms of apoptosis and transrepression is consistent with the inability of Mdm2 to bind p53-I.   Several variables, such as the extent of DNA damage and the levels of p53, also affect the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (58).
