0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	3	 A population-based (Kungsholmen Project) cohort of 985 nondemented Swedish subjects aged 75 years was followed for an average of 3 years (1990 to 1992); 164 dementia (122 Alzheimer's disease) cases were identified.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Compared with *3/*3, the APOE*4 allele increased the risk of developing dementia (relative risk (RR) = 1.

0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The effect of antihypertensive medication use was more pronounced among *4 carriers.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For those not using antihypertensive medication, the relative risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease for carriers were 2.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The corresponding relative risks for those using antihypertensive medication were 0.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The APOE*4 allele is an important predictor of dementia and Alzheimer's disease incidence.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Further studies are needed to clarify whether use of antihypertensive medication, especially diuretics, modifies the effect of the allele.

0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	17	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Increasing evidence indicates that the apolipoprotein E (APOE)*4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (1, 2).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An increased frequency of the *4 allele has consistently been found in both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases in different ethnic samples (3 to 17).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	19	 APOE*4 is related to global cognitive decline in the general elderly population (18 to 21), and it also increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease for memory-impaired persons (22, 23).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A community-based prospective study has provided strong evidence supporting the APOE*4 allele as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but it also suggested that previous family and case-control studies may have overestimated the contribution (24).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Indeed, *4 alone is neither necessary nor sufficient for development of the disease (11); a considerable proportion of *4 carriers do escape the disease (9).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Several studies have also noted a lack of significant association between *4 and Alzheimer's disease (25, 26).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A recent study (27) found evidence supporting a previous view that the APOE*4 allele is not a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease among African Americans and Hispanics.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It has been argued that the effect of APOE*4 may be mediated by other genetic factors or may be modified by some environmental exposures (28, 29).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	25	The Kungsholmen Project is a community-based longitudinal study of aging and dementia in people aged 75 years and older (30).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In our previous analysis, we found that use of antihypertensive medication (80 percent diuretics) was related to a lower prevalence of dementia, a decreased risk of developing dementia, and a slower cognitive decline among patients with dementia (31).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We therefore examined the effect of the APOE*4 allele on the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease by considering use of these drugs.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	28	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Study population The study population consisted of 1,310 subjects who were free of dementia at baseline and who participated in the first follow-up of the Kungsholmen Project.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Of these subjects, 985 with APOE genotyping were included in this analysis.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The Kungsholmen Project is a longitudinal study of aging and dementia that targeted all inhabitants of the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm, Sweden, who were aged 75 years and older on October 1, 1987 (30).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	31	 To detect prevalent cases of dementia at baseline, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to 1,810 participants (32).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Those with an MMSE score of  < 24 (n = 314) and a random sample of subjects with an MMSE score of 24 (n = 354) were then examined clinically (33).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Of 1,475 baseline participants who were free of dementia as diagnosed by means of the two-phase design, 174 were excluded from further follow-up because they refused to participate or moved away from Stockholm.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus, 1,301 subjects remained for the follow-up assessment of incident dementia cases; of these 1,301 subjects, 985 agreed to provide a blood sample for APOE genotyping.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	35	Identification of dementia Of the 985 subjects who provided a blood sample, 840 were administered a comprehensive clinical examination between November 1990 and April 1992.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	36	 A total of 145 subjects died before the follow-up examination; the medical records and death certificates of these subjects were reviewed by physicians.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, revised, diagnostic criteria (34) were used to define dementia.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease requires gradual onset, progressive deterioration, and lack of specific causes of dementia.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Our criteria for identifying Alzheimer's disease were similar to those used by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (35) for probable Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Three steps were used for diagnosis.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	41	 First, the examining physician made a preliminary diagnosis.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Second, all cases were reviewed independently by a neurologist, and a second preliminary diagnosis was made.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In the event of agreement between the first and second diagnoses, this second diagnosis was considered final; in the event of disagreement, a third opinion was requested and the concordant diagnosis was accepted.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Details of the clinical examination, diagnostic procedure, and primary results of data on the age- and sex-specific incidence of dementia have been presented elsewhere (36).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	45	Data collection The baseline examination was conducted from October 1987 to December 1989.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Arterial blood pressure was measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer, with the subject in a seated position after a 5-minute rest (37).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	47	 A standard polymerase chain reaction procedure was used for APOE genotyping (38, 39), and the DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Information regarding the medical history of each participant was derived from the computerized inpatient register, which covers all hospitals in the Stockholm area.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Heart disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac dysrhythmia, and heart failure) and stroke were treated as two potential confounders.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	50	Information on drug use, both prescription and nonprescription, was collected for the 2 weeks preceding the baseline interview (40, 41), and drug containers and prescription forms were inspected to verify the information.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Antihypertensive drugs included all medicines potentially used to lower blood pressure (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system (42) codes C02, C03, and C07).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	52	 For analysis, we first divided the whole sample into two groups according to use of antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	53	 We then divided the whole sample into two groups by use of diuretics (ATC code C03), regardless of other antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Finally, the sample was divided into three groups: the group receiving diuretic monotherapy, the group using other antihypertensive medications (ATC codes C02 and C07), and the group not using antihypertensive medications.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Among those who participated in the first follow-up of the Kungsholmen Project (n = 1,310), the drugs used by more than 20 subjects at baseline included diuretics (bendroflumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, spironolactone, amiloride hydrochloride), calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem), and ss-blockers (metoprolol tartrate, propranolol hydrochloride, alprenolol hydrochloride, atenolol).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Among them, bendroflumethiazide, furosemide, amiloride hydrochloride, and verapamil were used by more than 100 subjects.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	57	Statistical analysis Frequencies of variables between groups were examined by using the chi-square method.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of person-years of follow-up.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The follow-up time for nondemented subjects was determined from the date of baseline interview to the date of follow-up examination or death.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For demented subjects, half of this time was assumed.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	61	 We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to calculate the relative risks of developing dementia in relation to APOE genotypes, according to use of antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Because of limited numbers, we treated *2/*4, *3/*4, and *4/*4 as a group that we labeled *4, which was compared with *3/*3.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	63	 We considered age (in years), sex (female vs.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	64	 8 years), systolic blood pressure (two dummy variables,  < 130 and  > 160 compared with 130 to 160 mmHg), heart disease (yes vs.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	65	 no) as covariates in the models.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	66	 When age at dementia onset was used as the time scale in the Cox proportional hazards regression model, as suggested by Korn et al.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	67	 (43), very similar results were obtained.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Therefore, this paper presents results from the models in which the follow-up time was used.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	69	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Among the 1,301 subjects who participated in the follow-up evaluation, 224 were diagnosed as demented (164 Alzheimer's disease, 41 vascular dementia, 19 other dementias).

0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	90	 There were no significant differences in age, education, systolic blood pressure, or APOE genotypes between the two groups.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The incidence of all dementias and of Alzheimer's disease was lower among subjects using versus not using antihypertensive medication.

0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The latter group had a significantly decreased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	121	 These results were derived from the analyses in which age, sex, education, systolic blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke were considered.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	122	Our study may shed new light on the relation between APOE*4 and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	123	 First, the large-scale, prospective data from a general population confirm the link between APOE*4 and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, we estimated that only 12.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	125	9 percent of incident dementia cases and 16.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	126	4 percent of Alzheimer's disease cases could be accounted for by the *4 allele.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This result is very similar to that of a recent study concluding that 13.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	128	5 percent of incident Alzheimer's disease may be explained by *4 (24).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The lower population attributable risk could be due to the decreased relative risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with the APOE*4 allele after age 70 years (45, 46) and to the lower frequency of the APOE*4 allele in the very old.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In a meta-analysis, the risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with the APOE*4 allele increased until age 60 years in *3/*4 and *4/*4 carriers and until age 70 years in *2/*4 carriers, and it diminished thereafter (14).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Second, our finding of the lack of a significant association between *4 and Alzheimer's disease among those using antihypertensive medication supports a previous view that the effect of the APOE*4 allele is not uniform or is modifiable, as suggested in several studies (25 to 27).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Third, antihypertensive medication use significantly decreased the incidence of dementia; the effect was more pronounced in those subjects with the APOE*4 allele.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The probable explanation for these results is that antihypertensive medication can significantly reduce the number of cerebrovascular events or lesions now believed to be important in the pathogenesis of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, and that there may be an interaction between cerebrovascular disease and APOE*4 on dementia (47, 48).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	134	 A recent clinical trial showed that antihypertensive treatment reduced the incidence of dementia by 50 percent (49).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	135	It is unlikely that the lower risk associated with use of antihypertensive medication was due to the potential protective effect of the *2 allele (50), as we found no differences in the frequencies of APOE genotypes between the two groups.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	136	 If we assume that *4 carriers using antihypertensive medication have the same risk of Alzheimer's disease as *4 carriers not using antihypertensive medication, there would be no difference in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease between the two groups.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	137	Subjects who use antihypertensive medication may differ in many aspects, including genetic factors, from those who do not use these drugs.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Use of these drugs may just be a marker of an unknown factor or factors that can modify the effect of APOE*4 and thereby reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, there were no significant differences in baseline use of estrogens, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and salicylic acid agents between those who did and did not use antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We also examined several other drugs, including other cardiovascular agents, and did not find that these drugs could account for the results.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	141	In this study, the diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical data.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	142	 No neuroimaging and/or pathologic data were available for the diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	143	 We could not distinguish definite Alzheimer's disease from probable Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Misclassification of dementia and dementia types may have occurred, leading to decreased power in detecting small effects.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, it is unlikely that differential misclassification occurred.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In fact, had we classified more Alzheimer's disease patients as non-Alzheimer's disease patients in the group that used antihypertensive medication, because they were more likely to have had heart disease and stroke, we would have expected an excess of non-Alzheimer's disease cases to be associated with *4 in the group.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	147	 However, this was not the case.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Importantly, the results were consistent for all dementias and for Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	149	The first limitation of this study is that about 24 percent of eligible subjects did not undergo APOE genotyping.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Although the dropout rate was lower in this study than in previous studies, caution is necessary in interpreting the results.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease between those with and without APOE genotyping.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Also, among those subjects without APOE genotyping, use of antihypertensive medication was associated with a lower incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, although this finding was not significant.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	153	 The second limitation is use of a two-phase design in the initial survey of prevalent cases.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We estimated that 26 patients might have been missing from the screening test (51) and were thereby possibly included in the cohort of 1,301 participants in the follow-up assessment.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This problem may have led to an overestimation of the total incidence of dementia.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	156	 However, there is no reason to think that it may have significantly biased our results of the relation between APOE*4 and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	157	The third limitation is that the groups using antihypertensive medication were relatively small.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This problem might have reduced power to detect the difference in risk between *3/*3 and *4 and resulted in the wide range of confidence intervals that occurred.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Some confidence intervals overlapped between *4 carriers who did and did not use antihypertensive medication if different references were used (table 2).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, there was little overlap if the same reference was used (tables 3 and 4).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Furthermore, among those using antihypertensive medication, 80 percent used diuretics.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Although all results associated with use of antihypertensive medication were mostly due to use of diuretics, a similar trend for all dementias was also found with use of other antihypertensive medications.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, it seemed that use of other antihypertensive medications mainly affected the relation between APOE*4 and vascular or other dementias.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Alternatively, this finding could have been due to misclassification between types of dementia in the group using other antihypertensive drugs.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The fourth limitation is the lack of information on duration of drug use.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Generally, this limitation may have decreased the power to detect a given association or led to an underestimation of the association.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	167	 We performed Cox regression analyses by using age at onset as the time scale, which produced similar results.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Finally, unlike a clinical trial, our study was not designed to specifically assess the effects of antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In our cohort, the group using antihypertensive medication may have differed in many ways from the group not using antihypertensive medication.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Although we adjusted for a number of variables, including drugs that have been reported to protect against Alzheimer's disease, we cannot rule out the possibility that our results were biased by factors that we did not examine.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	171	In conclusion, our large-scale prospective data support the view that the APOE*4 allele is an important risk factor for late-onset dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, this allele may account for only less than 20 percent of incident cases in people aged 75 years and older.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Furthermore, a significant association between the APOE*4 allele and dementia or Alzheimer's disease was found only among those not using antihypertensive medication (80 percent used diuretics).
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Use of these drugs was related to a significantly reduced incidence of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, which was more pronounced among APOE*4 carriers.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Further studies are needed to clarify whether these drugs, especially diuretics, can modify the effect of the APOE*4 allele.
0.35228625.11157409.html.plaintext.txt	176	 At this time, antihypertensive drugs should not be prescribed to treat or prevent dementia.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	4	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor found in association with senile plaques (SP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	10	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease associated with the G/G genotype was 1.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	12	01) and in combination with APOE4 was 9.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	16	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits proteinases of all classes by a steric trapping mechanism.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	21	After being activated, A2M is cleared by the A2M-r/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (A2M-r/LRP).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A2M-r/LRP is a multifunctional receptor and interestingly is also the primary neuronal apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor (7,8).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 LRP also binds and clears the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor containing isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (9).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus A2M potentially impacts both apoE and APP metabolism in the brain.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because of these biological links to Alzheimer's disease, we studied the possible association of a previously reported polymorphism in the A2M gene with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (10) screened 30 normal and 30 pulmonary disease patients for A2M polymorphisms at or near the active site and reported three A2M polymorphisms.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The most common occurred 25 amino acids downstream from the thiolester site, interchanging Val1000 (GTC) and Ile1000 (ATC) (10).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (Numbering is based on the cDNA sequence which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide; this corresponds to Val/Ile976 in the mature protein.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	29	) Allele frequencies in their 60 probands were 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	30	 No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	32	Our initial exploratory experiment tested the possibility that the less common form of A2M (the `G' allele) would be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We genotyped 90 non-Alzheimer's individuals who had either undergone screening tests with the Blessed dementia scale (11) or whose DNA had been isolated from autopsy material and were demonstrated to not have Alzheimer's disease and 171 individuals who either had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or neuropathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (Table 1).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of DNA and restriction enzyme digestion (Fig.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In our control series, the G allele frequency was 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	37	28 and six of 90 individuals contained the G/G genotype (0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In the Alzheimer's disease set, the G allele frequency was 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We noticed that the G/G genotype frequency was increased in the Alzheimer's group at 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These results suggest a possible influence of this A2M polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	45	To formally test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype of A2M is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease, we collected and genotyped additional independent groups of patients and controls.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Power analysis showed that >500 Alzheimer's disease and control individuals would be necessary to have an 80% chance of showing a difference between genotype frequencies of 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We therefore collected cases and controls from several sites in order to approximate this number of samples.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The second data set consisted of individuals who met the same criteria for Alzheimer's disease or control as the hypothesis generating set and were derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients in Massachusetts, from three European centers and from probands of a multicenter US study of sib pairs and small families.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	50	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	51	05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The G allele was not over-represented in this data set (control = 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	53	 No difference in age of onset between G/G and non-G/G was found in the second data set.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Multivariate analysis showed that site of collection did not influence genotype frequencies.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	56	06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	57	056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	59	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The G/G genotype was present in 11.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	61	9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	64	2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	66	01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	69	001) relative to those with neither risk factor.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	70	 To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	74	5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	75	We next turned our attention to possible biological effects of inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	79	We also explored what effect inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype had on the neuropathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (Table 2).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We have previously used stereological techniques and quantitative image analysis to measure the amount of A[beta] present (amyloid burden) in the neocortical association area surrounding the superior temporal sulcus and the number of neurofibrillary tangles present in the same region (12).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	85	 There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Neuropathological correlates of the A2M genotype Genotype n Amyloid burden (%) Neurofibrillary tangles ( x 103) A/A 10 6.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	87	Exploratory studies of genetic risk factors run the risk of type I errors because of the large number of hypotheses that are either explicitly or implicitly being tested.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	93	05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	94	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	103	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12.
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19).
0.3103701.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20).

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	300	 First, we performed in vitro studies determining the protein expression and activity of CTSD in primary and in differentiated, stratified (organotypic) cultured keratinocytes.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	301	 We found a significant increase in CTSD protein levels and an increase in the enzymatic activity of CTSD in differentiated compared to primary keratinocytes, suggesting a function of CTSD during epidermal differentiation in vitro.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	303	 We found significantly increased epidermal expression of the active intermediate as well as the mature form of CTSD 3 hours and 5 hours after permeability barrier disruption, caused by increased processing and increased synthesis of the enzyme.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In accordance, we noted a significant increase of epidermal CTSD enzyme activity at different times after skin injury.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	306	, 1999), prevented an increase in the protein expression and in the activity of CTSD and significantly delayed permeability barrier repair after experimental disruption.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	307	 These results clearly show involvement of CTSD in the epidermal repair process after injury.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	308	The kinetics of CTSD processing and activation, as demonstrated by increased expression at 1-5 hours after treatment, corresponded to the activation of sphingomyelinase and the amount of epidermal ceramides after barrier perturbation (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	309	 In our previous study, a significant increase in acid sphingomyelinase activation and an elevated epidermal ceramide content 1-4 hours after barrier disruption was demonstrated (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	310	, 1999), thus acid sphingomyelinase-derived ceramide may be linked to CTSD activity during permeability barrier repair.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	311	The epidermis follows a programmed transformation of keratinocytes from the proliferating basal cells to the spinous, then to the granular and to the horny layers where the permeability barrier resides and finally desquamation occurs.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The enzymatic activity of TG1 correlated with the expression of a 35 kDa protein in wild-type mice, as detected by immunoblotting.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	318	 This 35 kDa protein was undetectable in the epidermis of CTSD( to / to ) mice, where we observed the expression of a 150 kDa TG1 protein instead.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	324	 A second fragment resided at the plasma membrane of keratinocytes and in regions of the skin including suprabasal layer, spinous layer and granular layer, but not the stratum corneum.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	325	 The differentiation-related 33 kDa TG1 fragment of this study could be the same protein as the 35 kDa fragment we detected in CTSD(+/+) mice, but not in CTSD( to / to ) mice.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	328	 During epidermal differentiation, the aspartate protease CTSD in the stratum granulosum (SG) is activated, cleaves the membrane-bound 150 kDa precursor of transglutaminase 1 (TG1) producing the active 35 kDa form.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	329	 TG1 in turn mediates cross-linking of the cornified envelope (CE) proteins involucrin and loricrin to the CE.

0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	331	The functional significance of TG1 for epidermal homeostasis was demonstrated by a delay in permeability barrier repair after inhibition of TG1 by monodansyl cadaverin.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Similar effects were observed after inhibition of CTSD by pepstatin A or inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase by imipramine (Jensen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	333	, 1999), suggesting the importance and possible associated function of all three enzymes for barrier formation and differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	334	Epidermal differentiation including the formation of the CE proteins involucrin and loricrin, are crucially involved in permeability barrier repair (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The soluble CE protein involucrin is expressed in the spinous layer at an early stage in keratinocyte differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Loricrin is an insoluble CE precursor, expressed later in the differentiation process in intracellular granules.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	337	The link between CTSD-dependent activation of keratinocyte TG1 and the expression of CE proteins was confirmed in CTSD( to / to ) mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	338	 In these mice, we found significantly reduced involucrin and loricrin protein levels after experimental skin injury in parallel to a reduced activity of TG1.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	339	 These results are in agreement with the effects observed after application of the CTSD inhibitor pepstatin A (data not shown).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Since a high molecular mass TG1 precursor protein was present in CTSD( to / to ) but not in wild-type mice, CTSD appears to mediate the proteolysis of the enzymatically inactive TG1 to the active enzyme.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Thus, the deficient mice also reveal a functional link between CTSD expression, maturation and activation of TG1, and the appearance of involucrin and loricrin in the epidermis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	342	Morphologically, the CTSD( to / to ) mice exhibited epidermal hyperkeratosis as a sign of disturbed epidermal differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The skin symptoms may be explained by a diminished ability of the corneocytes to bind intercellular lipids, caused by the reduced expression of involucrin and loricrin in the stratum corneum.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Previously, it was shown that the CE proteins, in particular involucrin, covalently bind -hydroxy ceramides.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	345	 These ceramides form a scaffold for the attachment of free ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids that provides stratum corneum lipid bilayers for the permeability barrier function (Downing, 1992; Steinert and Marekov, 1997).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Morphological disruption of the corneocyte layers was found in the CTSD( to / to ) mice (Fig.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	347	 These disruptions started at the interface of the stratum granulosum/stratum corneum, the place where normally the lipid bilayers extrude their lipids into the intercellular space.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Ultrastructural analysis of the epidermis in CTSD( to / to ) mice revealed broadening of the distances between the SC layers, with only a faint staining of the CE and thickened corneocytes in the axial direction.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	349	 This demonstrates the influence of CTSD on corneocytes and possibly on lipid organization in the stratum corneum.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Together, the morphological findings suggest an important role for CTSD in epidermal differentiation.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	351	To evaluate the consequences of CTSD deficiency and reduced TG1 activity in more detail, we analyzed the distribution of various epidermal keratins and CE proteins by immunohistology.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	352	 An extended expression of basal and differentiation-related keratins K5 and K1 as a sign of a disturbed differentiation was found in CTSD-deficient mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	353	 In previous studies we have found that expression of the differentiation marker K1 is disturbed after acute (tape-stripping) or chronic (metabolic, essential fatty acid deficient diet, EFAD) barrier disruption.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	354	 However, in these models we also found an increase in the expression of the proliferation-associated keratin K6 (and also K16) (Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Expression of K6 (besides changes in basal and differentiation related keratins) is also known in psoriasis (Hagemann and Proksch, 1996).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	356	 In CTSD( to / to ) mice K6 was absent, though a thickening of the horny layer was clearly visible.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Therefore, the CTSD( to / to ) mice may have similarities to so called `retention hyperkeratosis', such as ichthyosis, and not to so called `hyperproliferation-associated keratosis', such as psoriasis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	358	 In accordance, mice heterozygous for a truncated keratin K10, as a model for the ichthyosis called epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which is caused by point mutations in the suprabasal K1 or K10 (Cheng et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	359	, 2000), did not show K6/K16 protein expression in flank skin (Porter et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Ichthyosis is a group of skin disorders with different causes, showing disturbed epidermal differentiation with variable effects on the permeability barrier (Lavrijsen et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	361	The expression of involucrin and loricrin, as well as filaggrin, were significantly reduced in heterozygote and homozygote epidermis in the CTSD-deficient mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Filaggrin deficiency is well known in ichthyosis vulgaris (Gunzel et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Defective interaction between keratin and filaggrin is also seen in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Abnormal distribution of loricrin has been detected in genetic diseases involving loricrin (loricrin keratoderma, Vohwinkel's syndrome) (Maestrini et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Loricrin mutation in Vohwinkel's keratoderma is unique to the variant with ichthyosis (Korge et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Defects in cross-linking of loricrin are detected in TG1-deficient mice, the animal model of lamellar ichthyosis (Matsuki et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	367	Evaluation of the barrier function in our CTSD( to / to )-mice by measurements of TEWL revealed no constitutive defect.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	368	 We suggest that development of ichthyosiform skin compensates for defective stratum corneum morphology and deficiency in differentiation-related proteins.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Recently, similar results have been reported in mice lacking TG1 (Matsuki et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Skin from TG1-deficient mice, which die as neonates, lacks the normal insoluble CE and has impaired barrier function.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Neonatal TG1( to / to ) mouse skin was taut and erythrodermic, but transplanted TG1( to / to ) mouse skin resembled that seen in severe ichthyosis, with epidermal hyperplasia and marked hyperkeratosis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Abnormalities in those barrier structures remained, but TEWL was decreased to control levels in the ichthyosiform skin.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The authors suggested that the ichthyosiform skin phenotype in TG1 deficiency develops massive hyperkeratosis as a physical compensation for the defective cutaneous permeability barrier (Kuramoto et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	374	 A compensatory mechanisms maintaining skin barrier function in the absence of a major CE protein was also described in a loricrin-deficient mouse model (Koch et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Also, targeted ablation of the murine involucrin gene did not show defects in barrier function.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	376	 These mice developed normally, possessed apparently normal epidermis and hair follicles and generated CEs that could not be distinguished from those of wild-type mice (Djian et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	377	 The complexity and redundancy of epithelial barrier function has been discussed by Steinert (Steinert, 2000).
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Our CTSD( to / to ) mouse model has a broader impact on skin morphology than either involucrin or loricrin deficiency.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Notably, there are similarities between the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice, the skin of TG1( to / to ) mice and the human skin disease lamellar ichthyosis.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	380	 In lamellar ichthyosis a mutation in the TG1 gene resulting in a reduction in epidermal involucrin was described (Hohl et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	381	 The similarities are explained by the strongly reduced TG1 expression in the skin of CTSD( to / to ) mice.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	382	In the initial characterization of the CTSD-deficient mice atopic changes of the ileal mucosa leading to an insufficient mucosal barrier were observed.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	383	 The limit between epithelium and central connective tissue normally formed by a basement membrane was undetectable in these mice (Saftig et al.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Together, these results prove the importance of CTSD for barrier function and for epithelial differentiation in different organs.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	385	In summary, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest a crucial involvement of the aspartate protease CTSD in the activation of keratinocyte TG1 and in the regulation of the CE protein expression during epidermal differentiation, which is summarized in a model shown in Fig.
0.5179277.15126630.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Our findings may be important for the development of new treatment modalities in skin diseases with an altered epidermal differentiation pattern.

0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	4	The contribution of estrogens to the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders has attracted considerable attention over the last few years as a result of conflicting data from clinical trials, some of which have shown protective effects of postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy (HRT), whereas others (including the recently concluded Women s Health Initiative trial) have revealed no significant benefit.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although the reason for these apparently discrepant results remains the subject of heated debate, a growing body of evidence suggests that individual women may exhibit variable neuroprotective responses to HRT, in part because of interactions with other known risk factors for neurodegenerative disease.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	6	 One such risk factor, which modulates the effects of HRT on rates of cognitive decline in aging women, is the expression pattern of allelic variants of apolipoprotein E (apoE).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	7	 (1) in this issue of Endocrinology indicates why this may be the case.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Trophic effects of the natural ovarian estrogen, estradiol-17ss, on neurite growth in cultured mouse cerebral cortical neurons are reported to be critically dependent on apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, responses to estradiol-17ss are shown to be dependent on the type of apoE present: whereas estradiol-17ss is neurotrophic in the presence of human apoE 2 or apoE 3, the apoE 4 variant, which has been associated with the progression of late onset Alzheimer s disease, does not support this response.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	10	The concept that HRT might have beneficial effects on the aging brain evolved initially from studies in laboratory animals.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Almost 3 decades ago, estradiol-17ss was shown to exert neurotrophic effects in tissue explants derived from the developing mouse hypothalamus and preoptic area (2).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Synaptogenic effects of estradiol-17ss were later demonstrated to occur in the adult brain, including regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, that are important for cognitive function (3, 4).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In various models of neuronal damage, natural and synthetic estrogens were reported to enhance cell survival (5), whereas estradiol-17ss treatment was shown to enhance nonamyloidogenic processing of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (6).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Estradiol-17ss was also found to have positive effects on maintenance of the neurotransmitter systems that undergo degeneration in Alzheimer s disease (7) and Parkinson s disease (8).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Taken together, these observations provided strong mechanistic support for the concept that postmenopausal HRT might slow or prevent neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	16	Clinical trials have, in general, provided only mixed support for this hypothesis while simultaneously highlighting the potential health risks of long-term postmenopausal HRT use (1, 9, 10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Part of the problem appears to be that in human beings, unlike laboratory animals, effects of HRT may be confounded by a variety of other factors, which modulate or oppose the actions of the hormones.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	18	 One particularly important genetic factor appears to be the expression pattern of apoE.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Expression of different apoE alleles had previously been demonstrated to affect the risk of atherosclerosis (12) as well as the rate of progression of several human neurodegenerative diseases (13, 14), including Alzheimer s dementia (15).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Intriguingly, patterns of apoE expression were also found to significantly influence responses to HRT (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	21	The mechanism underlying this interaction remained uncertain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	22	 One possibility was that it might reflect the known effects of apoE expression on atherosclerotic processes (12), with cerebral vascular compromise secondarily affecting the rate of cognitive decline (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	23	 An alternative hypothesis, however, was suggested by studies aimed at elucidating the effects of estradiol-17ss on apoE expression in nerve cells.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Studies in mice demonstrated that expression of apoE in different brain regions varied with stage of the female reproductive cycle (17), consistent with the hypothesis that estradiol-17ss might induce apoE expression in the brain, as had already been demonstrated for apoE in blood (18).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Addition of apoE 3 was found to produce effects like those of estradiol-17ss on cultured neurons (19).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss were abolished in transgenic mice homozygous for deletion of the apoE gene (20).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These observations raised the possibility that apoE might represent an integral component of the mechanisms mediating trophic responses of neurons to estrogen exposure.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (1) demonstrate that this is indeed the case.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The growth-promoting effects of estradiol-17ss not only depend on the expression of apoE, they are also highly dependent on the nature of the apoE subtype.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In cultured cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex, estradiol-17ss increased both apoE levels and neurite outgrowth.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The hormone had no effect on neurite outgrowth from mice lacking the apoE gene, or when only apoE 4 was exogenously supplied.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	32	 ApoE 2, an apoE variant that has been associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease and increased age of onset, increased neurite length more than apoE 3 in the presence of estradiol-17ss.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Cultures from mice transgenic for human apoE 3 were capable of responding to estradiol-17ss, whereas those from mice expressing only apoE 4 were relatively insensitive.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Similarly, apoE 3 was accumulated in neurons to a greater extent than apoE 4 and was more effective in facilitating neuronal uptake of fatty acid.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that apoE may play an integral role in supporting the neurotrophic effects of estradiol-17ss and that patterns of apoE expression may have a profound impact on the sensitivity of the brain to estrogen action.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	36	These observations have important implications for future studies on the effects of HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	37	 If expression of specific apoE alleles is required for estrogen to exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects, the pattern of apoE allele expression is likely to be important in determining the effectiveness of estrogen-based HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Synergism between apoE subtype expression and the effects of HRT has already been demonstrated with respect to the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women, for which estrogen use appears to be particularly beneficial in patients with no apoE 4 allele (12).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The same situation may well be true for effects on neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	40	 (16) administered cognitive function tests over a number of years to women who were either taking estrogen-based HRT, had taken HRT at some time in the past, or who had never used HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the women who did not express the apoE 4 variant, postmenopausal estrogen use reduced the risk of age-related cognitive impairment by almost 50%, compared with the women who never used estrogen.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	42	 By contrast, apoE 4-positive women did not show a significant estrogen response (16).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that analysis of apoE variant expression may be predictive of whether HRT is likely to have long-term beneficial cognitive effects.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	44	 One of the key questions that remains to be answered is the extent to which the data presented by Nathan et al.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (1) can be extrapolated to the normal brain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	46	 used cultures of dispersed neuronal and glial cells from the adult mouse cerebral cortex.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	47	 It will be important in future to determine whether the effects of estrogens on the aging brain involve comparable apoE-dependent mechanisms.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Published evidence is consistent with the view that effects of estradiol-17ss on the recovery of the mature brain from injury require apoE.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, in mice, enhancement of synaptic sprouting by estradiol-17ss in response to an entorhinal cortex lesions is dependent on apoE expression (21).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	50	 However, neuronal damage, perhaps including the cellular damage inevitably incurred during the preparation of primary cell cultures, may result in reexpression of estrogen receptor mechanisms that are normally expressed only in development (22).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Hence, it remains to be established whether these findings can be extrapolated to the regulation of neuronal growth and survival in the uninjured brain.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	52	 (1), in dementia or after trauma, degeneration and repair may be in dynamic balance, with cognitive decline occurring when degenerative processes predominate.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, significant trophic responses to estradiol-17ss are also observed under conditions in which neurodegeneration is probably minimal (3, 4).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These responses may contribute to the effects of estrogens on cognitive performance (23).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	55	 It remains to be determined whether apoE is involved in the trophic actions of estradiol-17ss under normal physiological, as opposed to pathological, conditions.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	56	A second question is how apoE is regulated by steroids other than estradiol-17ss.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A wide range of estrogens and progestins have been used for HRT in postmenopausal women (10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It remains to be determined how these different steroids affect apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The question of the specificity of the apoE response is critical because of the possibility that some combinations of hormonal agents could abrogate the beneficial effects of natural estrogens.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For example, Nilsen and Brinton (24) have reported that whereas progesterone and 19-norprogesterone both potentiate the neuroprotective effects of estradiol-17ss, the opposite effect is observed with medroxyprogesterone acetate, the synthetic progestin used in the Women s Health Initiative trial.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Whether or not apoE expression is affected by other steroids is also important because of the fact that estradiol-17ss is not the only hormonal steroid with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Recent work suggests that androgens may confer protection against neurodegenerative processes.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Men with higher free testosterone levels appear to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer s disease (25), whereas reduced levels of the principal adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone, have been reported in Alzheimer s disease patients (26).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In laboratory studies, androgens and progestins have been reported to elicit neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects under a variety of experimental conditions (24, 27, 28).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Although in some cases these effects may involve either interactions with estrogen or intermediate estrogen biosynthesis, in others they clearly do not (27).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	66	 An intriguing hypothesis for future study is that apoE expression may represent a common link in steroid-activated neurotrophic responses.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	67	 If so, effects of androgens, like those of estrogens, may be influenced by apoE genotype.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Interestingly, this possibility has already been raised by preliminary clinical studies, which demonstrated interactions between testosterone and apoE 4 expression in men with Alzheimer s disease, as well as an association between apoE 4 and circulating testosterone levels in men without the disease (29).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	69	 These observations raise the possibility that the relationship between apoE expression and gonadal steroids may be multifactorial, with the apoE 4 allele directly affecting the risk of neurodegenerative disease via effects on neuronal growth and survival, as well as indirectly via reductions in testicular androgen secretion.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	70	Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the observations of Nathan et al.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	71	 (1), however, is the potential for development of novel strategies for replacement therapy designed to directly target the regulation of neural apoE expression.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The adverse effects of conventional HRT are primarily associated with responses that do not involve the brain, including alterations in coagulation factors, enhancing the risk of stroke, as well as trophic effects on the reproductive organs, resulting in increased risks for breast and endometrial cancer (10, 11).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	73	 If regulation of apoE expression is indeed a critical component of the mechanisms mediating neuroprotective responses to estradiol-17ss, direct targeting of apoE regulation in the brain might mimic the beneficial central effects of this hormone without the adverse risks associated with conventional HRT.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Such an approach seems at least potentially feasible, because the receptor systems mediating the effects of estrogens on central apoE synthesis may well be different from those found in nonneural estrogen target organs.
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Thus, estradiol-17, an estrogen with weak systemic hormonal activity, is fully capable of inducing apoE synthesis and release in mouse cerebral cortex and cultured glial cells (30, 31).
0.54427505.15198969.html.plaintext.txt	76	 As a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogen on apoE expression evolves, it may be possible to identify agents that will selectively up-regulate apoE expression in the brain with no significant adverse effects on tissues elsewhere in the body.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	25	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Although there has been controversy about the relative importance of plaques versus tangles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that altered metabolism of Ass peptides and amyloid deposition in neuritic plaques causes Alzheimer's disease by triggering a complex pathological cascade that produces dementia.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The Ass peptides Ass1-40 and Ass1-42, the two major species of Ass, are generated from APP by sequential proteolytic cleavage by ss- and - secretases.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These enzymes are not the only ones involved in the breakdown of APP: -secretase cleaves the full-length APP, producing soluble sAPP and, subsequently, p3.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Because processing by -secretase precludes production of full-length Ass peptides, it is anti-amyloidogenic (Younkin, 1998).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	33	Virtually all individuals with Down's syndrome have neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of Ass in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, H.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	34	 et al, 1995; Mann, 1988), and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai  and  Williams, 1989).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Despite the nearly universal occurrence of Alzheimer's disease pathology by middle age, there is wide variation in age at onset of dementia.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	42	 There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	44	The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for APP located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al, 1989) and the increased risk of dementia in Down's syndrome may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of Ass peptides.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	52	 A central task of the epidemiology of dementia in Down's syndrome is to identify factors that may influence risk of Alzheimer's disease by accelerating formation of Ass.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Several avenues of investigation are suggested by existing findings and I will review the role of (a) atypical karyotypes; (b) genetic susceptibility factors; (c) gender and oestrogen deficiency; and (d) individual differences in Ass peptide levels.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Prasher et al (1998) presented an interesting case of a 78-year-old woman with partial trisomy 21 [46,XX,rec(21)dup q, inv(21)(p12q22.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	63	 While her general appearance was suggestive, but not typical, of the Down's syndrome phenotype, she experienced several of the common age-related medical conditions characteristic of Down's syndrome, including hypothyroidism, cataracts, hypotonia and hearing impairment.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Analysis of gene sequences on chromosome 21 using fluorescent in situ hybridisation showed that the partial trisomy excluded the region containing the gene for APP, which was present in only two copies.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	65	 There was no evidence of decline in cognitive or adaptive competence for the 5 years preceding her death from pneumonia, and no evidence of Alzheimer's disease found on magnetic resonance imaging or neuropathological assessment.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Similarly there are two reports of women with Down's syndrome with 25% and 86% disomy for chromosome 21, respectively (Chicoine  and  McGuire, 1997; W.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Mutations in three genes, APP, presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2), are associated with early-onset familial forms of Alzheimer's disease that are transmitted as an autosomal dominant (Goate et al, 1991; Levy-Lehad et al, 1995; Sherrington et al, 1995).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Homozygosity for a common variant of PS1, the 1-allele, has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in some, but not at all, studies (Higuchi et al, 1996; Kehoe et al, 1996; Scott et al, 1996; Wragg et al, 1996).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Only one study has examined the influence of PS1 alleles on risk of dementia in Down's syndrome.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In that study of adults with Down's syndrome, there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between individuals with dementia and age-matched individuals without dementia (Tyrrell et al, 1999).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	77	Polymorphisms in the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) have been associated with risk for the more common late-onset Alzheimer's disease, that is, with onset after 65 years of age.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	78	 There are three common variants of the gene for APOE, encoded for by three alleles, 2, 3 and 4.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In numerous cross-sectional and case control studies, patients with Alzheimer's disease have been found to be significantly more likely than their peers to have one or more copies of the APOE 4 allele (Corder et al, 1993; Mayeux et al, 1993; Saunders et al, 1993).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The APOE 4 protein may act by increasing the rate of the process which leads to Alzheimer's disease, predisposing to greater accumulation of Ass in those with and without Alzheimer's disease (Roses et al, 1994; Hyman et al, 1995; Polvikoski et al, 1995).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The presence of the least common allele, APOE 2, has been associated with a delay in disease onset or even protection by most investigators (Corder et al, 1994; Roses et al, 1994).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	82	Apolipoprotein E in Down's syndrome The relation of APOE genotype to risk of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome has been difficult to establish.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	83	 All studies have consistently found that the presence of the APOE 2 allele increases longevity and reduces the risk of dementia but the role of the 4 allele has been controversial (Hardy et al, 1994; Royston et al, 1994; Martins et al, 1995; van Gool et al, 1995; Cosgrave et al, 1996; Lambert et al, 1996; Schupf et al, 1996; Prasher et al, 1997; Schupf et al, 1998; Sekijima et al, 1998; Tyrrell et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999; Rubinszstein et al, 1999; Deb et al, 2000).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Small sample sizes and, importantly, failure to consider differences in the age at onset of dementia among those with and without an 4 allele may account for some of the negative findings.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Since the effect of the 4 allele is not expressed until midlife, inclusion of sufficient numbers of adults over 50 years of age and analysis using survival methods that can adjust for age and years of follow-up are important methodological considerations.
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Our group used survival methods for analysis and found that the presence of the 4 allele was associated with earlier onset of dementia and greater decline in adaptive behaviour (Schupf et al, 1996).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Compared with those with the APOE 3/3 genotype, adults with Down's syndrome with an 4 allele were five times as likely to develop dementia by age 65, while no one with an 2 allele developed dementia (see Fig.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	98	 One large study examined 100 adults with Down's syndrome (40-70 years of age) and used survival analyses to examine age at onset of dementia by APOE genotype (Lai et al, 1999).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The cumulative incidence of dementia by age 65 was 55% for those with the APOE 2/3 genotype, 88% for those with the APOE 3/3 genotype and 100% for those with any 4 allele.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	113	In human studies, some, but not all, data show higher age-specific rates of Alzheimer's disease in women compared with men (Bachman et al, 1993) and approximately half the risk of Alzheimer's disease in women who have received oestrogen replacement therapy (Barrett-Conner  and  Kritz-Silverstein, 1993; Brenner et al, 1994; Henderson et al, 1994; Paganini-Hill  and  Henderson, 1994; Mortel  and  Meyer, 1995; Tang et al, 1996).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Such findings support the hypothesis that oestrogen deficiency contributes to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.

0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Both men and women with Down's syndrome show elevations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone at puberty indicative of primary gonadal dysfunction, which appear to progress with age and be more frequent in men than in women (Hasen et al, 1980; Campbell et al, 1982; Hsiang et al, 1987; Hestnes et al, 1991).
0.3144371.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Thus, older men may not benefit from the relative preservation of oestrogen proposed to account for lower risk of Alzheimer's disease in men in the general population.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To accurately determine the isoform-specific effects of human apoE on brain functions under physiological and pathological situations, we created mice expressing human apoE4 isoform in place of mouse apoE by utilizing the gene-targeting technique on the embryonic stem cells (knock-in).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The homozygous 4 (4/4) mice correctly expressed human apoE4 in the serum and the brain.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The human apoE in the brain was found primarily in the astrocytes as was the mouse apoE in the wild-type (+/+) mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In the 4/4 mice, the serum cholesterol level was 2.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	9	5-fold that of the +/+ littermate controls on a regular diet.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This marked elevation was accounted for by an accumulation of very low and low density lipo proteins.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the brains of the 4/4 mice, however, the amounts of total cholesterol and phospholipids were significantly decreased compared with the +/+ littermates.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These findings indicate that cholesterol and lipid metabolism is markedly altered in the 4/4 mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Our human apoE4 knock-in mice will be useful in clarifying the role of apoE in the etiologies of AD and cardiovascular diseases in relation to cholesterol and lipid metabolism.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a constituent of several classes of plasma lipoproteins and plays an important role in the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids among various cells of the body (1).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It serves as the ligand that mediates the uptake of lipoprotein particles into cells via the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the LDLR-related protein (LRP).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The brain is second next to the liver in the content of apoE mRNA (2), which is predominantly synthesized by astrocytes (3,4).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although much remains to be clarified about the lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in the brain, recent studies have revealed that apoE is present in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like lipoprotein particles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (5 to 7).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	18	Human apoE is a 299 amino acid protein that occurs in three major isoforms (apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4) encoded by three APOE alleles (2, 3 and 4) differing with respect to the presence of cysteine or arginine at two polymorphic sites.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	19	 ApoE3, the most common isoform, has cysteine at amino acid position 112 and arginine at 158; apoE2 has cysteine at both 112 and 158, and apoE4 has arginine at both sites (1).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Numerous epi demiologic studies have established that the 4 allele is associated with an increased risk of developing both familial late-onset and sporadic Alzheimer s disease (AD) (8 to 10).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	21	 ApoE immunoreactivity has been detected in senile plaques (11) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (12), the two hallmarks of AD.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Increased plaques have been found in the brains of 4 homo zygotes (13,14).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Studies have reported binding of apoE to amyloid ss-peptide (Ass) (8,15,16) and to tau protein (17), the principal constituent of NFTs.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	24	ApoE was originally identified as a 37 kDa protein associated with regenerating nerves (18), and better defined in later studies on crushed sciatic nerves (19 to 21) and lesioned brain (22,23).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Following brain injury, synthesis of apoE by astrocytes is upregulated, and it is considered to play important roles in the mobilization and redistribution of cholesterol and phospholipids during membrane remodeling (24).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Under these conditions of increased cholesterol availability, cholesterol synthesis is repressed both in the peripheral nerve (25) and the brain (23).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	27	The cholesterol content of the brain decreases with age (26), and even further in AD (27).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Recent studies with cultured cells implicate cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (see below).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Interestingly, a recent work showed that apoE4 induces neuronal cell death under conditions of suppressed cholesterol synthesis (28), suggesting that apoE4 may possibly be less efficient than apoE3 in reparative function in the brain under compromised cholesterol supply.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, cholesterol is an intriguing possible link between apoE and AD etiology.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	31	When allele-specific differences in apoE function need to be identified in vivo, it is desirable to have mouse lines in which the murine apoE is replaced by human apoE isoforms expressed under the natural regulation of this protein.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	32	 (29,30) produced human apoE3 and apoE2 knock-in mouse lines, and most recently succeeded in apoE4 mice (31).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The E4 homozygotes were found to have plasma cholesterol levels similar to the E3 mice, whereas E2 mice exhibited hypercholesterolemia.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We independently undertook generation of human apoE knock-in mice, using a different construct design of targeting vector.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Our E4 homozygous mice exhibit an elevated serum cholesterol level compared with the wild-type mice, whereas brain cholesterol content was significantly decreased.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This suggests that our human apoE4 knock-in mice will provide useful animal models for AD research in relation to cholesterol and lipid metabolism.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	38	 To retain normal mouse Apoe regulatory sequences as much as possible, the translation initiation codon of the human apoE4 cDNA in the knock-in allele was placed at the same position as that of the mouse Apoe in the wild-type locus.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	64	Expression of human apoE4 from the knock-in allele To examine the expression of human apoE4 from the knock-in allele, sera from the 4/4, 4/+ and +/+ mice were analyzed by western blot analysis (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Human apoE4 protein was detected with human apoE-specific rat mAb 868E5 (35) in sera of the 4/4 and 4/+ mice at the same 37 kDa position as in a control human serum (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Western blot analysis with mouse apoE-specific hamster mAb 874B7 (35) showed that mouse apoE was present only in the 4/+ and +/+ and not in the 4/4 mice (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	67	 2A, lower panel), indicating that the mouse Apoe coding sequence was completely replaced in the 4/4 mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Although we cannot precisely compare the amount of human and mouse apoE proteins on western blots due to the likely difference in the affinity of antibodies, it seemed that the level of human apoE4 in the serum of the 4/4 mice was comparable to that of mouse apoE in the wild-type mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	69	 We further showed that apoE in the knock-in mice was recognized by anti-apoE4 specific antibody Ab 412-1-12-2 which binds an apoE4-specific epitope (36) (Fig.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The possibility that the sialylation of apoE is differently regulated in the two species remains to be studied.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	80	We next examined the expression of human apoE4 in the brains of the knock-in mouse.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Western blotting experiments showed that the human apoE of 37 kDa was expressed in the 4/4 and 4/+ mouse brains (Fig.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	85	 No clear apoE immunoreactivity was seen over neuronal somata, although the fluorescence microscopy could not rule out a weak staining of neuronal processes in addition to astrocytic processes in the neuropil.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	86	 This pattern of apoE staining was similar to the distribution of mouse apoE in the +/+ mouse brain (Fig.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	93	  Lipid and lipoprotein phenotypes As an initial step in studying the functional impact of expression of human apoE protein, the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) in the 4/4, 4/+, +/+ and apoE-deficient ( to / to ) (37) mice were analyzed in the sera obtained after a 6 h fast (Table 1).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Serum TC level in the 4/4 mice (251  plus or minus  23 mg/dl) was 2.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	95	5-fold greater than that in the +/+ mice (101  plus or minus  8 mg/dl), but still much lower than in the  to / to  mice (697  plus or minus  60 mg/dl).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Males showed higher TC levels than females: 289 mg/dl versus 212 for 4/4 mice, and 115 versus 87 for +/+ mice (n = 3 each).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In the 4/+ mice, serum TC levels were slightly lower than in the +/+ mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	98	 There was no significant difference in TG levels among the 4/4, 4/+ and +/+ mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Similar results have been obtained for another independent knock-in line TgH(HAPE4)145.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	100	 For this line TC was 234 mg/dl for 4/4 compared with 131 for +/+ (n = 5 each).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The nature of elevated serum TC levels was further studied by analyzing lipoprotein profiles by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	102	 As shown in Figure 4A and B, the main cholesterol carrier in serum was HDL (fractions 17 to 25) in the +/+ and 4/+ mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In the 4/4 mice, however, 60% of TC was found in regions corresponding to the VLDL and LDL (fractions 1 to 16) (Fig.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	108	  The distribution of apoE was analyzed by western blot analysis of the FPLC fractions (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In the +/+ and 4/+ mice, the mouse apoE was mostly found in the HDL (fractions 17 to 25) and also LDL (fractions 10 to 16) regions with only a minor portion showing up in the VLDL region (fractions 6 and 7).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The distribution pattern of human apoE4 in the 4/+ mice was very similar to that of mouse apoE in the +/+ and 4/+ mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In contrast, the majority of apoE was present in the VLDL and LDL regions with two peaks at fractions 6 to 7 and 12 to 13 in the 4/4 mice, in addition to the presence in the HDL region.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	112	 On western blot analysis with anti-mouse apoE, three discrete bands of 34, 36 and 39 kDa were detected.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The relative abundance of the three molecular species appeared to vary with fractions: the 39 kDa species was relatively more abundant in the VLDL, the 36 kDa species in the LDL and the 34 kDa species in the HDL regions.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	114	 With the anti-human apoE antibody, all fractions displayed the 37 kDa band accompanied by a weak low molecular weight band, a likely partial degradation fragment (38) (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	115	As the serum cholesterol level was markedly elevated in the 4/4 knock-in mice, it was of particular interest to examine the brain lipids.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The brain size was not significantly different among mice of 4/4, 4/+ and +/+ genotypes.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Total cholesterol level of the whole brain, however, was reduced by  > 30% in the 4/4 brain compared with the +/+ brain (Table 2).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	118	 A less pronounced reduction in TC was also observed in the brains of the heterozygotes.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	119	 A significant reduction in the brain phospholipid content was also found in the 4/4 mice, but not in the heterozygotes.

0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	122	 A more thorough study is needed to establish absence of altered anatomical phenotype in the knock-in brains.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	123	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We have produced a line of human apoE4 knock-in mice in which the expression of human apoE4 is under the control of the enhancer/promoter of endogenous mouse Apoe gene, and mouse apoE expression was completely eliminated.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In these mice, serum cholesterol level was 2.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	125	5 times that of the +/+ littermate controls.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This marked elevation of serum cholesterol was shown to be primarily due to an accumulation of very low and low density lipoproteins.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The brains of 4/4 mice had significantly reduced total cholesterol and phospholipids compared with the littermate controls.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	128	Transgenic mouse models A number of research groups have in the past produced mice expressing human apoE isoforms instead of the mouse protein through pronuclear injection of human apoE cDNAs placed under various heterologous promoters, and breeding with the apoE-deficient (knock-out) lines generated earlier to eliminate the mouse protein (39 to 41).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In this type of transgenic mouse generally, the levels and patterns of transgene expression vary from line to line due to differences in the chromosomal integration sites with unavoidable position effects as well as uncontrollable copy numbers of inserted transgenes.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Thus, no two lines can be precisely matched for studying subtle isoform differences.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Moreover, expression of apoE in cell types other than the natural expressers through use of heterologous promoters may not provide a valid model animal for AD research.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	132	 GFAP promoter has been used by some to direct expression of human apoE to astrocytes (39,40).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, the expression pattern of apoE in the normal mouse brain does not exactly coincide with that of GFAP (35).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Expected absence of apoE in the periphery in such mice should cause disturbances in the systemic lipid metabolism (42,43) that may have indirect consequences in the central nervous system (CNS).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	135	A most desirable approach, therefore, is to place the transgene expression under the control of endogenous regulatory elements.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	136	 (44) introduced large segments of human genomic DNA encompassing the APOE locus with attendant human regulatory regions, but the fact that the transgene constructs did not match precisely among the three apoE alleles, combined with uncontrolled integration loci and copy numbers, renders interpretation of results subject to ambiguity.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	137	 (29,30) pioneered the generation of human apoE3 and apoE2 mice, and Knouff et al.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	138	 (31) recently reported their apoE4 mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	139	 They took advantage of homo logous recombination to replace a segment of DNA at the Apoe locus with homologous segments of human genomic DNA.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The plasma TC level of their E4 homozygotes was not significantly different from that of E3 homozygotes.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We used a targeting vector of different design employing human apoE cDNA coding region flanked by appropriate murine genomic DNAs (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	142	Hypercholesterolemia in the apoE4 knock-in mice Our homozygous apoE4 mice displayed marked hypercholesterolemia (249%) compared with the wild-type littermates (Table 1).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Preliminary results with our E3 homozygotes of F3 generation indicated that their average TC value is 125 mg/dl (n = 6) compared with 93 mg/dl (n = 5) for their wild-type littermates, indicating that the hypercholesterolemia of E4 mice is an allele-specific phenotype.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	144	The apparent discrepancy in the cholesterol phenotype between Knouff et al.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	145	 s E4 mice and ours is not likely due to a difference in the fat or cholesterol content of the mouse diet, because a high fat chow did not differentiate cholesterol phenotypes of Knouff et al.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Nevertheless, a possibility cannot be excluded that some other component of the diet may have contributed to the discrepancy.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This can be tested by exchanging mice or diets.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The difference in the construction of transgenes may also be responsible.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The Apoe/APOE gene of our knock-in mice lacks introns 2 and 3, whereas Knouff et al.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	150	 s mice (31) carry a chimeric intron 1 and human introns 2 and 3, possibly leading to a subtle difference in the regulation of apoE expression.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This could be tested by careful comparative analyses of apoE protein expression.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	152	Our analysis of lipoprotein profile (Fig.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	153	 4) showed a large increase in VLDL- and LDL-cholesterol without significant changes in the HDL-cholesterol.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Interestingly in the humans also, 4 carriers have increased plasma cholesterol and LDL (45,46).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	155	 ApoE4 has been shown to distribute relatively preferentially to VLDL rather than HDL when compared with apoE3 (47,48).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	156	 A higher catabolic rate of apoE4-bearing VLDL (49) has been offered as an explanation of higher plasma cholesterol levels observed among human 4 carriers (45).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In this explanation apoE4-bearing VLDL delivers cholesterol more efficiently to the liver, and also accelerates the conversion of VLDL remnants to LDL driving its accumulation.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Both will lead to a down-regulation of LDL receptor and further accumulation of LDL.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	159	 It is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism may operate in our 4/4 mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	160	Brain cholesterol As a first step toward understanding the physiological and pathological roles of apoE, brain lipids were measured in our apoE4 mice.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In contrast to the serum, the homozygote brain showed 32% reduction in total cholesterol, and 17% reduction in phospholipids, when compared with the wild-type littermates.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These measurements mostly reflect cell-associated lipids rather than lipoproteins in the interstitial fluid, and thus do not necessarily contradict the elevated cholesterol level found in the serum.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Nonetheless, it raises a possibility that the mechanisms of brain parenchymal cholesterol metabolism and traffic may be substantially different from those on the other side of the blood to brain barrier.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In fact, apoE and apoAI are the major apolipoproteins, but apoB is not found, in the CNS (5), and LRP is considered to be an important apoE receptor in the brain in addition to the LDL receptor (13).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The decreased brain cholesterol content of the E4 knock-in mice is not likely to be the consequence of interspecies inconsistency between the human apoE and the murine apoE receptors in the brain, since our preliminary results indicate that the brain cholesterol content of our apoE3 knock-in mice is not significantly different from that of wild-type littermates.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	166	 An interesting possibility would be some property peculiar to the apoE4 protein, such as a hypothetical ability to extract cholesterol from myelin more efficiently, that manifests itself primarily in the CNS tissues.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Published studies of human apoE knock-in mice by Sullivan et al.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	168	 (29 to 31) were devoted to hematologic and vascular studies, and to our knowledge no data are available for comparison regarding their brain cholesterol levels.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	169	The reduced cholesterol content in the brains of apoE4 knock-in mice is particularly intriguing because of recent recognition that Ass can be detected in association with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (50,51), and that cholesterol availability affects APP processing in cultured cells (52 to 57) and in the brain (58).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Contents of cholesterol and other lipids have been found to be decreased in AD brains (27).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Whether this is the result of degenerative loss of synapses and cells, or it has etiological significance remains to be studied.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Much more needs to be learned about cholesterol metabolism in aging and AD brains.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	173	 A more detailed analysis of cholesterol and other lipids in the brains of our apoE4 mice is also urgent, as well as analyses of APP metabolism there.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Equally awaited is the study of doubly transgenic mice to be produced by breeding the apoE  humanized  lines of mice with the APP-overexpressing transgenic lines that develop pathological changes (59,60) and to determine how human apoE isoforms differentially affect Ass production and deposition in the brain.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	175	Dynamic up-regulation of apoE expression after physical injury has long been known in the peripheral nervous system and CNS (19,21,22).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	176	 More recent studies on experimental ischemia (61), head injury in humans (62) and brain lesions in apoE-deficient mice (63) further support the idea that apoE plays a part in neural repair processes.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Perhaps this is a reflection of increased importance of cholesterol recycling in the brain parenchyma, which does not have ready access to the cholesterol in general circulation (64).
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Since AD entails sporadic neuronal deaths during characteristically protracted course of the disease, small differences among apoE isoforms in the efficiency of cholesterol transport could have substantial cumulative effects on the timing of clinical onset of AD.
0.38527274.10655544.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Such a possibility could be tested by comparing apoE3 and apoE4 mice with respect to their reactions to one-time and synchronous neuronal insults such as caused by neurotoxin administration (65) or appropriate surgical lesion experiments (66).

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	4	It has long been postulated that apolipoprotein E (apoE) may play a role in lipid metabolism in the brain.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, direct evidence that apoE plays such a role is lacking.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We investigated whether apoE isoforms influence lipid content in the brain.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We compared the brains of wild-type mice to apoE knockout (/) and human apoE3 and apoE4 transgenic mice and compared cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of humans with different apoE isoforms.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We found that there was no effect of apoE on the content of multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	9	 There was, however, a marked effect of apoE on the sulfatide (ST) content in both the brain and CSF.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The sulfatide mass in hippocampus and cortex of apoE knockout mice was found to be 61 and 114 mol% higher than wild-type mice counterparts at 12 months of age.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, the sulfatide content in brain tissues from human apoE4-expressing mice was ~60% less than those found in wild-type mice of the same age.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The ST mass in human CSF was significantly dependent on the APOE genotypes of the subjects.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Examination of potential sulfatide carrier(s) in human CSF demonstrated that sulfatides are specifically associated with apoE-containing high density lipoproteins, suggesting that sulfatide levels in the central nervous system (CNS) are likely to be directly modulated by the same metabolic pathways that regulate levels of apoE-containing CNS lipoproteins.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This novel role for apoE in the CNS may provide new insights into the connection of apoE with Alzheimer's disease and poor recovery after brain injury.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	15	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	16	Human apolipoprotein E (apoE, protein; APOE, gene),1 a 34-kDa protein coded for by a gene on chromosome 19, plays a prominent role in the transport and metabolism of plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerides through its ability to interact with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (1, 2).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It has been postulated that apoE may also play an important role in the redistribution of cholesterol and phospholipids within the central nervous system (CNS) (3) where apoE is expressed mainly in astrocytes (4, 5).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In vitro and in vivo data suggest that apoE can play a role in neurite outgrowth and sprouting (4, 6-9), however, whether this is due to effects on cholesterol and lipid metabolism is unclear.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition to its role as a plasma lipid transport protein, apoE participates in pathobiological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) (10).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The effect of apoE in AD is likely to occur at least in part via interactions with the amyloid- (A) peptide (see Ref.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To date, the mechanisms of how apoE is involved in all of these biological processes have not been completely clarified.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	22	There are three common isoforms of human apoE that differ in amino acids at positions 112 and 158 (1).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The most common isoform, apoE3, has cysteine at position 112 and arginine at 158, whereas apoE2 has cysteine at both positions, and apoE4 contains arginine at both positions.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The isoforms are encoded by three alleles at the same gene locus.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	25	 ApoE4 has been shown to be a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (10).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Although the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is not entirely clear, studies suggest that apoE influences A deposition and toxicity in the brain (12-15).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	27	Sulfatides (ST) represent a class of sulfated galactocerebrosides that differ only in the composition of the fatty acid residue that acylates the amino group of the sphingosine.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Sulfatides mediate diverse biological processes, including the regulation of cell growth, protein trafficking, signal transduction, cell adhesion, neuronal plasticity, and cell morphogenesis (see Refs.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Sulfatides are almost exclusively synthesized by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and are present predominantly in the myelin sheath surrounding axons and, thus, are present in both white matter and gray matter (16).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Altered levels of ST in human brain tissues are involved in the pathogenesis of various human diseases.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Accumulation of ST, due to a sulfatidase deficiency, is responsible for metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which there is encephalopathy, long tract signs, and degeneration of myelin in the CNS (19).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In contrast, our recent study demonstrated that substantial ST deficiency occurs at the very earliest stages of AD, although the one or more causes of this deficiency remain unclear (20).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Mice deficient in ST and galactocerebrosides (GalC), generated by knocking out a ceramide galactosyltransferase, generally die by 3 months of age and demonstrate several abnormalities, including abnormal axonal function, dysmyelinosis, and loss of axonal conduction velocity (21-24).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	34	Numerous studies have demonstrated the role of apoE on the normal variation of plasma lipids in an isoform-dependent manner (see Refs.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Therefore, it has long been postulated that apoE may also play a role in lipid metabolism in the brain.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, direct evidence that apoE plays such a role is lacking.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this study, we investigated whether apoE or apoE isoforms influence lipid content in the CNS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We found that there were no significant effects of apoE on the content of multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In contrast, apoE had a dramatic effect on the sulfatide content in the CNS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Furthermore, the potential mechanisms of the relationship between apoE and ST, including ST in assembly of nascent apoE particles, ST transport and presence within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipoproteins, and ST hydrolysis mediated by apoE, were also investigated in the study.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Collectively, we have uncovered a novel role for apoE, modulation of ST content, in the CNS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This finding may provide some new insights into the role(s) of apoE in biological and pathological processes in the CNS such as in AD and following brain injury.

0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	213	The involvement of apoE in metabolism of phospholipids and cholesterol in the plasma is well known (1, 25).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	214	 To investigate whether apoE influences the mass distribution of brain lipids, we systematically quantified the distribution of lipids including multiple phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol in different brain regions of wild-type, apoE/, and human apoE transgenic mice.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We found that there are no significant effects of apoE on the content of all examined lipids with the exception of ST levels, which were dramatically altered in both the apoE knockout and human apoE transgenic mice.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Furthermore, this apoE-mediated alteration in ST content in the CNS is regulated by aging as well as by apoE produced in the brain, because the human apoE transgenic mice only express apoE in brain and still have markedly elevated plasma cholesterol (26).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The results from the examination of the ST content in astrocyte-secreted apoE particles indicate that apoE can acquire a small amount of ST directly from cells that secrete apoE.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	218	 However, because most brain ST is produced by oligodendrocytes and located in myelin in the CNS, it is likely that the majority of ST in apoE particles in the CNS is acquired from myelin after apoE secretion from its expressed cells.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The major effect of mouse and human apoE appears to be in keeping ST levels in brain at a lower level than that present in the absence of apoE.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This effect is probably due to apoE-containing lipoproteins facilitating cellular clearance of ST.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Although hydrolysis of ST directly catalyzed by apoE was not observed in this study, apoE-associated ST hydrolysis in vivo can not be completely excluded.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Because we showed that ST directly associates with apoE-containing lipoproteins in CSF, it is likely that transport of ST by apoE particles in brain interstitial fluid and CSF and endocytotic recycling of apoE particles through LDL receptor or LDL receptor family members such as LDL receptor-related proteins (37) are the major pathways by which apoE mediates ST metabolism in the CNS.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	223	The 4 allele of APOE is a strong genetic risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas the 2 allele is protective.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Although there are several possible mechanisms as to why these associations exist, there is very strong evidence to suggest that the interaction between apoE and A play an important role in the effect of apoE on AD (see Refs.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	225	 For example, in transgenic animal models that develop AD-like amyloidosis and neuritic plaques, the lack of apoE results in little to no fibrillar amyloid formation nor neuritic dystrophy (14, 39), and the expression of human apoE results in an isoform-specific deposition of amyloid within neuritic plaques with the effect order being apoE4  >  E3  >  E2 (15, 40).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	226	 These effects of apoE on A are likely mediated by interactions between apoE-containing HDL (the form of apoE in brain) and A.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Given these issues, is there any way that sulfatide association with apoE-containing lipoproteins may be involved in apoE-A interactions?.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	228	It has been shown that apoE interaction with A is markedly influenced by the presence of lipids (41-43).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, previous work (27) and the data presented here have shown that there is not a quantitative difference in the amount of most phospholipids and cholesterol present in brain or CSF lipoproteins in the presence or absence of apoE or apoE isoforms.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In contrast to this, we observed a significant isoform-specific difference in ST levels (E4  >  E3) in human CSF lipoproteins.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Although we have not yet explored whether sulfatide levels in apoE particles influence interactions with A, we have shown that a portion of A co-elutes with apoE-containing HDL particles shown here to also contain ST in human CSF (27).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	232	In addition to the effect of apoE and apoE isoform on risk for AD, there is substantial evidence that apoE4 is also a risk factor for poor outcome following certain CNS injuries such as head trauma, multiple sclerosis, and possibly stroke (see Ref.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	233	 How it is that apoE plays a role in these processes remains unclear.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	234	 It is possible that the effect is via an isoform-specific difference in regeneration as has been shown in some in vitro and in vivo models (see Ref.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It is also possible, particularly in the case of multiple sclerosis and possibly stroke, that apoE is somehow regulating CNS inflammatory processes such as cytokine production as has been seen in some models (e.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	236	Interestingly, numerous studies have shown that sulfatides are ligands for a family of receptor proteins, called selectins, located on activated vascular endothelial cells, leukocytes, and activated platelets (45-51).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Although the relationship between the role of apoE in immunoregulation and sulfatide as a ligand for selectins is unclear, it has been shown that sulfatides are potent anti-inflammatory agents (52).
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This potential relationship likely indicates a possible role of ST in apoE particles as an anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory molecule.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	239	In sum, although apoE in the brain does not play a major role in regulating brain phospholipid and cholesterol levels, our data show that apoE plays an important role in regulating brain sulfatide levels, via apoE-containing CNS lipoproteins serving as an extracellular ST carrier that regulates its metabolism.
0.32282493.12501252.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Further work on understanding the relationship between apoE and ST may provide important clues to the pathogenesis of the effects of apoE on both AD and following different CNS injuries.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apoE has been shown to decrease foam cell formation and prevent atherosclerosis.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	6	 An apoE molecule can mediate cholesterol efflux from the macrophage that originally secreted it (autocrine effect) or from surrounding macrophages (paracrine effect).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Traditional methodologies have not been able to separate these serial effects.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The novel methodology presented here was developed to separate autocrine and paracrine effects by using a simple mathematical model to interpret the effects of dilution on apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Our results show that, at very dilute concentrations, the paracrine effect of apoE is not evident and the autocrine effect becomes the dominant mediator of efflux.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, at saturating concentrations, paracrine apoE causes 80 to 90% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux, whereas autocrine apoE is responsible for the remaining 10 to 20%.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results suggest that the relative importance of autocrine and paracrine apoE depends on the size of the local distribution volume, a factor not considered in previous in vitro studies of apoE function.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, autocrine effects of apoE could be critical in the prevention of foam cell formation in vivo.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This novel methodology may be applicable to other types of mixed autocrine/paracrine systems, such as signal transduction systems.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	15	AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE in atherosclerosis research is the characterization of the effects of locally synthesized apolipoprotein E (apoE) within the vessel wall.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Endogenous synthesis and secretion of apoE by macrophages in the vessel wall have been shown to protect against atherosclerosis (22).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Arterial macrophages participate in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and lipid metabolism.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	18	 ApoE, which is synthesized by hepatocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages, mediates lipoprotein metabolism and affects cellular cholesterol homeostasis.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	19	 apoE from macrophages accepts cholesterol from cells in the vessel wall and transports it back to the liver, where the cholesterol can be excreted as bile (3, 9).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This pathway is called the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) system.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The effect of apoE can be due to its cellular or extracellular positioning, and therefore an apoE molecule can mediate cholesterol efflux from the macrophage that originally secreted it (autocrine effect) or from surrounding macrophages (paracrine effect).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The terms "autocrine" and "paracrine," traditionally applied to signaling peptides and hormones, have also been used to describe the actions of mediators with a broad range of functions besides signal transduction (1, 7, 25).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It can be assumed that for the sake of cholesterol efflux an individual macrophage cannot distinguish the apoE that it secretes from the apoE derived from neighboring cells.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, because the endogenous synthesis of apoE causes high spatial proximity, autocrine apoE is at an advantage compared with paracrine apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The spatial proximity advantage of endogenous apoE results in a temporal sequence of autocrine effects occurring before paracrine effects and a concentration gradient from an autocrine compartment (high concentration) to a paracrine compartment (low concentration).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	26	Making comparisons between the autocrine and paracrine effects of apoE synthesized by macrophages has proven difficult.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For in vitro experiments with cultured macrophages, exogenously applied apoE has been used to approximate paracrine or endocrine apoE (14, 19).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Endogenously synthesized apoE has been used to approximate autocrine apoE (16, 19 to 21).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These approximations do not consider that a single molecule of an endogenously synthesized mediator can have a series of interactions that employ a combination of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (4).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	30	The novel methodology discussed here was developed to separate autocrine and paracrine mechanisms by using a simple mathematical model to interpret mediator-induced biological effects.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This study shows that whereas macrophage apoE has both autocrine and paracrine effects on cholesterol efflux, autocrine apoE has smaller but more consistent effects than paracrine apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Whereas macrophage apoE is used to demonstrate this novel methodology, the concepts have applications for separating the autocrine and paracrine effects of many other secreted biological mediators including growth factors, cytokines, and carrier proteins.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The basis of this theory is that the range of autocrine signals approximates the width of the secretion layer, which separates the cell from the bulk medium.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (30) suggest that two phenomena occur when a mediator goes beyond the autocrine range: 1) the mediator is no longer autocrine, and 2) the mediator becomes diluted in the bulk medium.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our data suggest that the relative importance of the autocrine and paracrine effects of apoE depends on the size of the local distribution volume, with the autocrine effects remaining constant even when the paracrine effects are diminished by apoE dilution.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The descriptive equation generated from these data (Eq.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	187	 6) suggests that autocrine and paracrine apoE work in parallel to mediate cholesterol efflux from macrophages.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	188	Our study suggests that autocrine apoE has advantages that are biologically relevant.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Even when the extracellular space is saturated with apoE, at least 10 to 20% of the apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux is the result of volume-independent interactions of endogenous apoE (Table 1).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	190	 (19) found that with apoE-deficient cells, the exogenous application of apoE at 10 times the concentration of normal endogenous apoE secretion did not increase cholesterol efflux as much as normal endogenous apoE secretion by apoE-producing cells.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The fundamental importance of these media transfer studies is that they show that exogenous apoE (paracrine) is not equivalent to endogenous apoE (autocrine and paracrine).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	192	 For a macrophage with endogenously synthesized apoE, the advantage of autocrine apoE may become critical if homeostasis is challenged by cholesterol loading, if the conditioned space is large (making apoE diluted), if the turnover of conditioned space is high because of interstitial flow, or if a macrophage is isolated from other macrophages.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The interstitial concentration, distribution volume, and turnover of macrophage apoE in the vessel wall are not known.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These factors are critical for the interpretation of data from in vitro cell culture systems and the generalization of these data to the biology of macrophages in vivo.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	195	 For example, the trend in viability may be related to changes in apoE secretion observed at very low volumes (Fig.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	198	, CO2) in varying distribution volumes.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Because apoE is not the only mediator being secreted in our system, it was necessary to subtract the effects of confounding mediators.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	200	 This is why apoE+/+ macrophages were compared with apoE to / to  macrophages and why the specific apoE effect was calculated as apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux (E).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The effects of confounding mediators on cholesterol efflux were minimal (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Although the major role of apoE is as an extracellular cholesterol acceptor, it is also possible that a portion of the effect of apoE on cholesterol efflux is the consequence of other actions of apoE, such as receptor or proteoglycan binding (17), intracellular cholesterol routing (8), or even stabilization of the cytoskeleton (6).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Irrespective of which ultimate mechanisms or combination of effects may be responsible for the modulation of cholesterol efflux by apoE, these can only occur through either autocrine or paracrine events and are therefore addressed as a whole in our study.

0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The lack of staining for plasma-derived apoE within the artery wall suggests that penetration into clusters of macrophages is limited.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The macrophage, not plasma-derived apoE, is the primary source of apoE for RCT (5, 12, 22).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Along these same lines, paracrine apoE may not be able to fulfill the critical actions of the small amount of autocrine apoE in the juxtacellular space or possibly even the intracellular space.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	217	 apoE recycling, the internalization and resecretion of apoE (10, 13, 33), has been reported to mediate cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes and in macrophages (13).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The methodology in this study is unable to resolve the "internal autocrine" (31) or "intracrine" (28, 29) mechanism that could be mediated by intracellular apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	219	 6 in which macrophages secrete apoE to create an extracellular sink for cellular cholesterol.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The capacity, concentration, and compartmentalization of the sink affect cholesterol efflux (Fig.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The sink has a capacity (ft) that expands as apoE is secreted.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The sink can be separated into two compartments that are a consequence of the location of apoE in juxtacellular or extracellular space, also described as the secretion layer and the bulk layer, respectively (18, 27).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The dilution of apoE as it moves to the extracellular space diminishes its efficacy.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	224	 ApoE-mediated efflux (E) is a balance between the efflux and influx of cholesterol.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Efflux depends on the sink capacity (ft), the concentration of extracellular apoE (V to 1), and the functional concentration of juxtacellular apoE (C).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Influx depends on the cholesterol in the apoE sink (E) and the functional concentration of juxtacellular apoE (kI).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Decreases in the functional concentration of apoE that contribute to influx (nt) may represent changes in the capacitance of apoE due to accumulation of phospholipids that stabilize cholesterol or to proteolytic alteration of apoE.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	228	 It is also possible that n is an artifact of slight changes in viability or apoE secretion.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In many of the documents that are found by a literature search for the term "autocrine," the terms "autocrine and/or paracrine" describe the proposed mechanism of action.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	230	 It is difficult to quantitatively separate these two mechanisms experimentally.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Traditional approaches to this problem have limitations and rely on simple qualitative assessments.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Traditional methodologies that have been used to study macrophage apoE include characterizing the tissue distribution of apoE (11), measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis of apoE vs.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	233	 its complete absence (11), and measuring the effects of the endogenous synthesis vs.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	234	 exogenous application of apoE (15, 19).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	235	 These methods are useful in comparative assessments, but they are unable to simultaneously quantify the serial effects mediated by apoE or other secreted biological mediators.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	236	In the present study, we have performed experiments based on the theory that the portion of the endogenous acceptor that mediates autocrine effects cannot be diluted.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Previous studies have utilized experimental strategies similar to the one used in our study.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	238	 (32) performed volume dependence experiments to study whether efflux to exogenous acceptors is proceeded by aqueous diffusion of cholesterol or by acceptor-membrane collisions.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	239	 They found that, for certain types of acceptors, efflux approached a "volume-insensitive plateau," and they proposed that these types of acceptors may have "sites for efficient collisional transfer" (32).
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Our studies with endogenously synthesized acceptors suggest that these sites may be a combination of binding sites on the membrane and an enriched aqueous layer around the membrane (i.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	241	 (27) used a theoretical model to study the escape of autocrine signaling ligands into the extracellular space.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	242	 They found in a model of a ligand-receptor signaling system that "varying volume heights shows little effect on ligand concentrations.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	243	" It remains to be seen whether the dilution methodology discussed here can change mediator concentrations over the large dynamic range (many orders of magnitude) of a log-linear dose-response curve such as those seen for ligand-receptor signaling pathways.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	244	In summary, this study separates and quantifies the autocrine and paracrine effects of apoE on cholesterol efflux from macrophages.
0.3207539.15509658.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These data suggest that the relative importance of autocrine and paracrine apoE depends on the size of the local distribution volume, with the autocrine effects remaining constant even when the paracrine effects are diminished by the dilution of apoE.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The deficits did not encompass all aspects of cognitive ability, were present only in women, and were evident at a younger age (39 years) than that which has been reported in people who do not have diabetes (7).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Female susceptibility to APOE 4-associated cognitive disadvantage has been described for WAIS-R performance test ability in healthy elderly women (20), although the pathogenesis of the possible sex difference remains unclear.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Age influences the effect of APOE 4 on cognitive ability; neuropsychological performance in healthy children (21) and healthy young adults (22) is not affected by the 4 allele, but middle-aged otherwise healthy adults (mean age 46 years) have been observed to have impaired learning and memory ability (7).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The younger age (median age 39 years) at which 4-associated cognitive disadvantage was observed in adults with type 1 diabetes in the present study implies premature susceptibility compared with nondiabetic individuals.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	95	Laboratory and clinical evidence supports the concept of 4-associated premature cognitive aging in diabetes.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Elderly people with type 2 diabetes and the 4 allele exhibit greater cognitive decrement (23) and an accelerated cognitive decline (24) compared with age-matched 4 healthy control subjects; APOE from people with diabetes is irreversibly glycated and exhibits less in vitro bioactivity (25) when compared with nondiabetic control subjects.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	97	 APOE bioactivity appears to have clinical relevance, as outcomes from a variety of cerebral pathologies are poorer in individuals possessing the least biologically active E4 isoform (8).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	98	 As the present study did not include a healthy comparator group, the notion that APOE 4 is associated with premature cognitive aging in type 1 diabetes is speculative at present, whereas this has been demonstrated in type 2 diabetes (23,24).
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	99	The present study did not support the hypothesis that polymorphism of the APOE gene may contribute to the susceptibility to hypoglycemia-induced cognitive decrement in people with type 1 diabetes.

0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	101	 n = 6 hypoglycemia naive) does not give sufficient power to allow definitive conclusions, and further, appropriately powered investigation is required to evaluate this hypothesis.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Irrespective of the influence of APOE alleles, cognitive performance was unaffected by severe hypoglycemia per se, consistent with the conclusions of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (3) and the Stockholm Diabetes Intervention Study (4), in which many participants had type 1 diabetes of relatively short duration, but conflicting with retrospective cross-sectional studies (2) that examined older subjects with diabetes of long duration.
0.3392243.12502505.html.plaintext.txt	103	In conclusion, the data in this modestly powered study suggest that APOE 4 confers a cognitive disadvantage in young women who have type 1 diabetes.

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	4	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   In recent years, important progress has been made in uncovering genes implicated in Alzheimer s disease (AD).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Three causal genes have been identified in which mutations cause familial presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene and the presenilin 1 and 2 genes.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Additionally, the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene was shown to be a major risk factor for AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Despite the genetic heterogeneity, all of these genes work through a common mechanism, i.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	8	 increasing the amount and deposition of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) in brain triggering AD-related neuronal degeneration.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, the levels of Ass and of the factors involved in its production and deposition are important in the neuropathogenesis of AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Regulation of transcription of AD genes might therefore be an important player in the neurodegenerative process.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In this review, we describe the major features of transcriptional regulation of the known AD genes and the implications of variable expression levels on susceptibility to AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	13	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain characterized by neuronal loss, extensive deposition of amyloid ss peptide (Ass) in the brain parenchyma and in vessel walls, and the appearance of neuronal inclusions of abnormally phosphorylated tau.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The regions that are most affected are the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Clinically, AD patients show a gradually progressive decline in memory and cognitive functions that is diagnosed on neurological examination, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Among the dementias, AD is the most frequent, with 70% of cases affected.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The prevalence of AD increases with age, with 40% of the population older than 85 years affected (1).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Apart from aging per se, two other well defined risk factors are gender and family history of AD (2).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The genetic etiology of AD is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors influencing the expression of the phenotype.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Nevertheless, in a small percentage ( < 1%) of AD cases the disease is inherited as a fully penetrant monogenic trait in an autosomal dominant manner.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In all these cases, the disease onset is before the age of 65 years, i.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	22	 presenile AD or early-onset AD (EOAD).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These monogenic AD families have been instrumental in the identification of AD genes using the positional cloning approach.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	24	 At least four genetic loci that confer inherited susceptibility have been identified to date.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Characteristics of these genes are summarized in Table 1.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The first causative gene identified for EOAD is the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) (3) on chromosome 21q21.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	27	2 (4), encoding a single membrane-spanning protein (5 to 9).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Full-length APP is metabolized rapidly by two major pathways in all cells.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In many cells, the most prominent pathway is the constitutive pathway where -secretase cleaves the Ass sequence (10), producing N-truncated Ass peptides.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Neurons, however, have an intrinsic tendency to metabolize APP along the amyloidogenic pathway (11 to 13), in which sequential cleavage by ss- and -secretases releases full-length Ass peptides.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Whereas ss-secretase cleaves highly specifically, -secretase cleaves less specifically, leading to either a 40 amino acid peptide (Ass40) or a 42 amino acid isoform (Ass42) (14,15).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	32	 All eight AD-related APP mutations detected to date are located near the secretase cleavage sites and have been demonstrated to interfere with APP processing, leading to increased secretion of Ass42.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This Ass42 peptide has been shown, at least in vitro, to aggregate more rapidly into fibrils (16) and was claimed to be the earliest and most abundant Ass peptide in amyloid deposits (17 to 19).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recent theories propose that Ass deposits or partially aggregated soluble Ass trigger a neurotoxic cascade, thereby causing neurodegeneration and AD (20,21).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	35	 As a result, Ass and, in particular, Ass42 were assigned a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	36	 AD genes   The most frequently mutated EOAD gene is presenilin 1 (PSEN1), located on chromosome 14q24.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Based on homology studies, the third causal EOAD gene, presenilin 2 (PSEN2), was isolated and mapped to chromosome 1q42.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The PSEN genes encode highly homologous integral membrane proteins with eight putative transmembrane domains (27 to 30).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To date,  > 60 PSEN1 and 4 PSEN2 mutations have been identified in EOAD patients, scattered over the entire coding region of the genes (http://molgen-www.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Both in vitro and in vivo, PSEN mutations lead to increased Ass42 production, suggesting a role for PSEN in the processing of APP (31 to 45).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Together, these findings led to the hypothesis of a gain of function for mutant PSEN (20) and provided further evidence for the central role of Ass42 in AD pathogenesis.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	42	 PSENs have also been shown to be death substrates undergoing caspase cleavage during apoptosis (46 to 48).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Although the role of apoptosis in neuronal cell death in AD remains to be proven, AD-linked PSEN mutations, as well as decreased expression of PSEN1 and overexpression of PSEN2 (46), result in apoptosis (49).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, the homology with SEL-12 of Caenorhabditis elegans suggested a possible role for PSEN in NOTCH signaling (50).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Further evidence was provided by the study of embryonically lethal PSEN1-deficient mice, which show abnormal somite segmentation, a phenotype shared with NOTCH1-deficient mice (51,52).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Moreover, mutations in other genes involved in NOTCH signaling also lead to central nervous system (CNS) disorders with onset ages in adulthood (53).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	47	In addition to the three causative genes, the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on chromosome 19 was identified as a genetic risk factor for both EOAD (54,55) and late-onset AD (LOAD) (56 to 58).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The risk associated with the 4 allele is dose dependent, which is reflected in the increased risk and decreased onset age with the number of 4 alleles (59).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Several observations indicated that APOE 4 is also involved in increased Ass deposition.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	50	 It was shown that APOE promotes Ass fibril formation in vitro (60).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Also, APOE 4 has a higher binding affinity for Ass than has APOE 3 (56,61), possibly making Ass insoluble and therefore more prone to deposition.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Although these in vitro data are controversial, AD patients homozygous for APOE 4 have indeed been shown to have more Ass deposits than APOE 3 homozygotes (62).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Also, it was shown that APOE 4 influences the onset age of EOAD patients carrying an AD-related APP mutation but not that of PSEN1 mutation carriers (63).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	54	Since mutations in the causal EOAD genes explain  < 1% and APOE 4  < 20% of all AD cases (22,64,65), it is clear that other genetic factors are involved in AD pathogenesis.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Variation in the regulatory regions of APP (66,67), PSEN1 (22,68,69) and APOE (70 to 73) have been suggested to contribute to susceptibility to AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In this review, we will discuss the importance of expression levels of known AD genes and the implications of variations in their regulatory regions for susceptibility to AD.

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	58	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   APP is expressed in a variety of tissues, with the highest expression in neuronal cells of the CNS (6,74 to 77).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	59	 APP expression can be induced by a variety of agents such as growth hormones and cytokines (9,11,78 to 86) and by stress conditions (87 to 89).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Up-regulation (90,91) of APP promoter activity corroborates with mRNA expression studies (82,92), suggesting a major role for the APP promoter in specific APP expression.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	61	The control mechanisms of APP gene expression have been subject to extensive studies.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The APP promoter contains numerous putative binding sites for regulatory transcription factors (Table 2) (93 to 97).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, deletion mapping of the APP promoter demonstrated that  < 100 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) are sufficient for high levels of expression in numerous cell types (98 to 100).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This proximal promoter region is devoid of a functional TATA box, and transcription initiation is regulated by a strong initiator element (Inr) surrounding the major TSS +1 (Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Mutations within and immediately upstream of Inr lead to altered use of multiple TSSs and reduce transcriptional activity.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Both Inr and the upstream element (UE) are associated with DNase I-protected domains, suggesting sequence-specific binding of nuclear factors (101).

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	77	  APP promoter activation is covered mainly by two GC-rich elements (Table 2, Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The  to 93/ to 82 fragment (APBss) contributes at least 70% to APP promoter activity in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and was shown to bind the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a known regulator of c-myc expression implicated in the promotion of apoptosis (Table 2, Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The remaining APP promoter activity is accounted for mainly by the  to 65/ to 41 fragment (APB) and is mediated by binding of stimulating protein 1 (SP1) and the upstream stimulatory factor (USF), member of the c-Myc-related family of DNA-binding proteins (99,104 to 106).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Recently, an interaction model for APP transcriptional activity based on DNA looping was presented.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In this model, a novel SP1-like protein forms a homodimer tethering the USF and 5'-flanking SP1 sites, and the upstream AP-1 site with flanking GC-rich motif (Fig.

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	85	  Transcriptional activation of APP can also be mediated by heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) binding to the heat shock element (HSE) at position  to 317 (Table 2, Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	86	 HSF-1 activation is induced by numerous stress factors, including hypoxia, decreased pH, elevated Ca2+, decreased ATP and exposure to reactive species.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	87	 It was also reported recently that members of the NF-B/Rel family can specifically recognize two identical sequences at  to 1837/ to 1822 and  to 2250/ to 2241, in the distal promoter region of APP, referred to as APPB sites (108).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These sites were shown to interact specifically with a complex containing the p50 subunit of the NF-B family that is constitutively expressed in neurons and acts as a positive regulator of gene expression in cells of neuronal origin (109).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The distal APP promoter also harbors at least one negative regulator of transcription, the upstream regulatory element (URE) between  to 2257 and  to 2234, binding an unknown transcription factor (TF), expressed in a restricted number of cell types and different regions of the human brain (110,111).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	90	Not only are the structure and expression pattern of APP highly conserved between species (112,113), but the promoter regions of rodents and primates are also highly homologous to that of the human APP (80%) (93,94,114).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	91	 They all have a high GC content, lack typical TATA and CAAT boxes and share nearly all of the above-described TF-binding sites (Table 2), suggesting a major role for these TFs in APP regulation in vivo (93,94,99,114).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	92	Like APP, the PSENs are ubiquitously expressed, although they display markedly tissue-specific transcriptional differences.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In brain, both PSEN1 transcripts of 2.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	94	5 kb are present at relatively high levels, whereas only one PSEN2 transcript (2.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	95	3 kb) can be detected at relatively low levels (24,26, 115,116).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Both PSENs are expressed primarily in neurons and to a lesser extent in glial cells (117 to 127).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The PSEN1 5'-untranslated region (UTR) is contained within four exons, with the first two exons (1A and 1B) being alternatively transcribed (Table 1) (128,129).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Multiple TSSs have been reported to date, with the major exon 1A TSSs designated +1(P1) and (P2) (Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	99	Deletion mapping of the PSEN1 promoter delineated the most active fragment from  to 118 to +178 relative to +1(P1), in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (131).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The sequence in this region contains  > 70% GC, lacks a TATA box but contains transcriptionally active GC boxes around positions  to 70,  to 50 and +20 (Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The crucial PSEN1 promoter element is located between  to 22 and  to 6 and controls  > 90% of PSEN1 promoter activity.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This region contains a binding motif for Ets proteins at  to 12 (Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	103	 1B), and altering the core sequence results in a drastic decrease in promoter activity, by interfering with TF binding.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In neuronal cells, the PSEN1 promoter binds an Ets-1/2 protein.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Both Ets-1 and Ets-2 are widely expressed in different tissues but are differentially regulated (132,133).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Ets-2 is present at high levels in adult brain, including post-mitotic neurons.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Ets-1 is particularly abundant in the CNS during specific developmental stages (133).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Another Ets family member, Elk-1, has also been shown to be expressed in brain where it is localized exclusively to neurons (134).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Which members of the Ets family are able to activate PSEN1 transcription in vivo is not clear.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Sequences (+107 to +178) downstream from the TSS also contain major cis-elements, controlling 80% of total PSEN1 promoter activity.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Collectively, these data indicate that sequences upstream and downstream of the TSS each control  > 80% of promoter activity, indicating the importance of protein to protein interactions between TFs binding to upstream and downstream cis-elements.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	112	Preliminary data on murine PSEN1 promoter activity and in situ hybridization suggest that PSEN1 is expressed and transcribed preferentially in neurons.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The structure and expression of PSEN1 are highly conserved between mice and human.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Multiple mRNA transcripts, originating from TSSs of alternatively transcribed first exons, have been reported for both species.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Reporter gene analysis showed that both TSSs are most probably controlled by one single promoter spanning the +1 position of exon 1A (130).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In human, only one exon 1B transcript has been reported so far; therefore, it is difficult to conceive how exon 1B transcription can be driven from the same promoter as the abundant exon 1A transcripts, as described for the mouse transcripts.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Hence, it is possible that transcription from the human exon 1B is controlled by its own promoter or at least by exon 1B-specific cis-elements, possibly located downstream of +178.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Until now, no data on functional cis-elements controlling transcription from human PSEN1 exon 1B have been reported.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	119	In the regulatory region, maximal similarity is found in the  to 39/+117 sequence of the mouse PSEN1 promoter region.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The +20 GC box (SP1) and the  to 12 Ets motif are strictly conserved, and reporter gene analysis indicated that this region contributes to the neuron-preferred promoter activity (130).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The mouse sequence upstream of position  to 39 differs significantly from the human sequences.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Absence of long stretches of sequence homology is one of the main problems in promoter recognition and it is conceivable that more functional cis-elements, although not located at the corresponding positions, are shared between the mouse and human PSEN1 promoter.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Furthermore, sequences from  to 22 to +178, which confer  > 80% of human PSEN1 promoter activity, coincide with the region of high homology with the mouse promoter.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Also, the major human +1 TSS is located only eight nucleotides downstream of the mouse TSS (130,131), emphasizing the importance of this region for the function of the promoter in both species.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	125	Despite the striking similarities between PSEN2 and PSEN1 in genomic structure, alternative transcripts and use of multiple TSSs (116,135,136), there is little homology in the 5'-flanking region, and the first two exons of PSEN2, although alternatively transcribed, are not mutually exclusive (116).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	126	 There are two distinct cis-elements regulating transcription from the predicted TSS.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	127	 PSEN2 basal promoter activity resides between  to 403 and +13, a TATA-less, GC-rich region containing numerous putative AP-2 and SP1 sites (137).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In this region, a functional nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive element that mediates PSEN2 promoter activation following NGF treatment also resides.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The observed 2-fold up-regulation by NGF confirmed the predicted involvement of PSENs in neuronal differentiation (138).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Whether the AP-2 or SP1 sites clustered in this region or another as yet unidentified cis-element is responsible for the NGF responsiveness is not yet clear.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Further deletion analysis provided evidence for the existence of a second PSEN2 promoter located in intron 1, directing transcription from the start sites in exon 2, though no functional elements have been identified so far.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	132	APOE is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types and its expression is highly regulated by nutritional, hormonal, tissue- and cell-specific factors, and intracellular cholesterol levels (139,140).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In contrast to the causal AD genes, the 5'-flanking sequence of APOE harbors a functional TATA box (141).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Multiple general and specific cis-elements have been mapped to the APOE promoter (Table 2, Fig.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The proximal GC box binds SP1 and is required for maximum transcriptional activity (142).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Three non-specific enhancer elements, active in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (143), were identified.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Two of these, upstream regulatory elements 1 (URE1) and 2 (URE2), reside in the proximal promoter region and one resides in the first intron, the intron regulatory element 1 (IRE1).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The dominant regulatory sequence in URE1 is located from  to 161 to  to 141 and is termed the positive element for transcription (PET).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This fragment binds at least two TFs, one of which is SP1.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Although SP1 is the only protein required for enhancer activity of PET, a second as yet unknown protein competes with SP1, in this way possibly negatively regulating APOE expression (142).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	141	 A fourth regulatory domain in the APOE promoter, URE3, binds the 300 kDa URE3-binding protein, but needs further characterization (144).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	142	In astrocytic cells, the activity of the proximal promoter of APOE is up-regulated synergistically by cAMP and retinoic acid (RA), which is mediated by two AP-2 sites located in the proximal promoter (145).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	143	 cAMP mimics the changes occurring in reactive gliosis (146,147) and RA is a potent morphogenetic agent on the developing nervous system and a known regulator of AP-2 expression (148).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It is therefore reasonable to presume that the observed synergistic effect of cAMP and RA on the APOE promoter is probably due to an RA-promoted increase in AP-2, followed by a post-transcriptional activation of AP-2 mediated by cAMP (148,149).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	145	 More tissue-specific cis-elements identified at present seem to reside downstream of APOE, with a potential brain-specific transcriptional activator in the APOE to APOCI intergenic region (150 to 154).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	146	The 5' upstream region of rodent APOE is homologous to human APOE up to 200 bp upstream of the TSS (155,156), with the TATA box, the proximal GC box and URE3 at corresponding positions (Table 2) (141,156,157).

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	148	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Screening for mutations in the  to 802/+268 APP promoter fragment in sporadic, and familial EOAD and LOAD cases did not reveal any AD-specific mutation (158 to 161).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, a CG transversion was detected at position  to 209 in both affected and unaffected subjects (Table 3) (161).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Although this variation is not unique for AD, it may have an effect on APP transcriptional activity associated with AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Since the number of patients and controls was small and the individual analyses covered only parts of the APP promoter, one cannot yet exclude the existence of AD-related variations in the APP promoter altering transcriptional activity.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Recent sib-pair analyses suggested that genetic variability at the APP locus may contribute to risk for LOAD (66,67).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It is obvious that a systematic screening of the APP regulatory sequences in extended AD populations is necessary.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Promoter variations in AD genes   Besides the amount of full-length APP available, the amount and activity of APP processing factors also influence the production of the amyloidogenic Ass42.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Since PSENs were assigned a pivotal role in APP processing, altered PSEN expression due to variations in regulatory regions is considered a risk factor for AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Genetic association studies in a population-based EOAD case to control sample showed association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  to 48CT with EOAD (Table 3) (68).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Systematic screening of 3 kb of the PSEN1 upstream region in the same population revealed, in addition to  to 48C/T (22), four novel polymorphisms ( to 1789G/A,  to 2154G/A,  to 2319Tn and  to 2823I/D), two of which ( to 2154G/A and  to 2823I/D) were also shown to be associated with increased risk for EOAD (Table 3).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Linkage disequilibrium allowed for the identification of an EOAD risk haplotype ( to 48C/ to 2154G/ to 2823D).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Additionally, two potentially AD-related mutations ( to 280CG and  to 2818AG) were identified (Table 3) (69).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The effect of  to 280CG and  to 48CT on the transcriptional activity of PSEN1 was studied in a transient transfection system.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Luciferase reporter gene analysis demonstrated a neuron-specific 30% decrease in promoter activity for the  to 280G mutant and a neuron-specific 50% decrease in promoter activity for the  to 48C risk allele, which in homozygous individuals can lead to a critical decrease in PSEN1 expression.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Notably, the genetic association of  to 48C with EOAD was explained by an over-representation of the CC genotype in EOAD patients.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These studies provide evidence that increased risk for EOAD associated with PSEN1 may result from genetic variations in the regulatory region leading to altered expression levels of PSEN1 in neuronal cells due to differential binding of nuclear proteins (69,162,163).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These data suggest that the increased risk for EOAD associated with PSEN1 may result from decreased expression levels of the PSEN1 protein.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	165	Although PSEN2 has also been shown to be involved in APP processing, and changes in its expression levels might be important in AD pathology, no association was found with AD and no PSEN2 promoter variations have been reported to date.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	166	It was shown that the relative APOE 4 mRNA level is increased in AD compared with controls, and it was suggested that genetic variability in the neuronal expression of APOE contributes to disease risk (70).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Multiple studies suggested that genetic variability in the regulatory region of APOE may modulate the risk associated with the APOE 4 isoform.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The first variation detected in the APOE regulatory region was a CG transversion at position +113 in the intron 1 enhancer element (IE1), although no statistically significant association independent of APOE 4 could be detected (Table 3) (164).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In a population-based study, three SNPs ( to 491AT,  to 427TC and  to 219TG alias Th1E47cs) and two heterozygous mutations ( to 557CT and  to 456CT) were identified (Table 3) (71,73).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Reporter gene analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the three SNPs alter transcriptional activity of the APOE promoter due to differential binding of TFs (71,72).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	171	 For all three SNPs, genetic association with AD, independent of APOE 4, was reported (71 to 73).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although several studies attempted to confirm this association, most reported either absence of association or association due to linkage disequilibrium with APOE 4 (114,165 to 172).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, population-based differences of APOE 4 frequencies, giving rise to differences in relative risk for AD, have been documented previously (173,174).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It is therefore conceivable that there is a wide variation in relative risk for AD associated with APOE promoter polymorphisms.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	175	In vivo studies demonstrated that the deleterious effect on disease risk of both the  to 219T and  to 491A risk alleles correlated with an increased expression of the 4 allele in brain (175).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Later it was shown that the  to 491AA risk genotype is associated with increased levels of APOE in plasma, independently of APOE 4 or AD status, though more pronounced in AD patients (176).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These data provide evidence that, in addition to the qualitative effect of the APOE 2/3/4 isoforms on risk for AD, the quantitative variation of expression of these isoforms due to functional APOE promoter variations is a key determinant in AD development.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	178	   IMPLICATIONS OF VARIABLE GENE EXPRESSION ON AD PATHOGENESIS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	179	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The most favored hypothesis suggests a pivotal role for increased Ass42 secretion in AD pathology.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Since the amount of APP and of factors involved in its processing are crucial for this elevation, it is conceivable that the transcriptional regulation of their genes plays an important role in AD pathology.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A number of studies indicate that the amount of APP mRNA is indeed increased in AD brains (177 to 181).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, trisomy 21 in Down syndrome (DS) patients leads to a 4- to 5-fold overexpression of APP, resulting in a 50 year decrease in onset age of AD in DS patients compared with the normal population (182).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results imply that a fundamental component of the molecular etiology of AD may lie in the expression of APP, its biogenesis and turnover, since the induction of the pathway leading to Ass production will depend on the amount of APP present.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	184	Since overlapping cis-elements are known to be important for differential gene expression (183 to 185), the presence of overlapping SP1- and USF-binding sites in the APP promoter suggests that two different and independent regulatory pathways for APP expression might exist, one mediated by SP1 and the other by USF (104).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	185	 SP1 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed, however, with a substantial variation in different cell types and during development (186).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The low levels of SP1 detected in different brain regions suggest that USF might also contribute substantially to the high expression of APP in neuronal cells, which was confirmed by EMSA with nuclear extracts from rat brain showing binding to USF but not to SP1.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	187	 A number of factors have been reported that are able to influence SP1 activity in certain cell types, in this way leading to preferred usage of one pathway (187,188).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Therefore, a deregulated overexpression of APP in brain might simply be caused by a local increase in SP1 activity.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	189	Additionally, AD brains exhibit numerous features which indicate that neurons affected by AD exist under conditions of stress.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Since APP expression is regulated by stress factors, one can speculate that APP may be one of the genes coordinately modulated in brain in response to situations that require a defensive reaction.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Stress-induced overexpression of APP can then lead to increased Ass production.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	192	 It is therefore conceivable that an imbalance between different regulatory pathways for APP expression, caused by a variation in a functional cis-element or by altered expression levels of TFs in specific brain regions, might be a risk factor for AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	193	During aging, the expression of PSENs decreases (120), and an even more significant decrease in PSEN has been reported in neurons from brain areas adversely affected by AD (189,190).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast, astrocytes reacting to neurodegeneration express elevated levels of PSEN (189,191).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Several lines of evidence indicate that PSEN1 is closely linked to the -secretase processing of APP and that decreased expression ( < 50%) and mutations in PSEN1 lead to increased secretion of Ass42 (20,192).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Small changes in PSEN expression levels can have major implications for APP processing and AD pathology.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	197	Additionally, PSENs were shown to be death substrates undergoing caspase cleavage during apoptosis (46 to 48,193).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Although the role of apoptosis in neuronal cell death in AD remains to be proven, it is interesting that PSEN2 overexpression and AD-linked mutations in both PSENs can shift conventional PSEN cleavage towards caspase cleavage (46), whereas a reduction of PSEN1 results in apoptosis (49).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Regardless of the hypothesis on AD pathology, it is clear that expression of both PSENs is highly regulated and that mutations or variations leading to altered expression can easily be imagined to have major effects on PSEN functioning.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	200	APOE was suggested to be involved in the repair process following nerve injury.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	201	 It was shown that APOE has an effect on neurite morphogenesis of cultured neurons, where APOE 3 reduces the amount of neurite branching and promotes neurite extension, whereas APOE 4 does not (194,195).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In brain, APOE synthesis takes place in astrocytes (196,197) and is increased dramatically after nerve injury (198 to 200).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The reactive gliosis in AD brains involves a series of morphological and biochemical changes in activated astrocytes (201), including up-regulation of APOE mRNA levels which is mediated by AP-2 (202).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Further determination of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of APOE synthesis in brain is a matter of greatest importance, considering the possible roles of this protein in processes of repair in the pathogenesis of AD (56,59).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Here, special attention needs to be drawn to mechanisms of differential expression of the different APOE isoforms.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	206	Although it is clear that expression levels of AD genes are important in AD etiology, little is known about their specific regulation.

0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	211	 APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 are ubiquitously expressed, though with a tightly controlled differential regulation depending on tissue and cell type, developmental stage and environmental factors.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Interestingly, all these proteins are synthesized predominantly in neurons of the CNS.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This highly controlled regulation implicates the presence of specific regulatory elements mediating transcriptional activity, though only few of these have been described to date.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The regulation of APOE is extremely complex, with multiple general and specific positive and negative cis-elements.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In brain, APOE is expressed in astrocytes and is probably involved in neuronal regeneration processes.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	216	It is well documented that single nucleotide changes in a promoter region may affect transcriptional activity mediated by TFs (203,204), either by directly altering a TF-binding site or by changing the structure of DNA, thereby affecting the access of TFs.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Multiple studies provided evidence that altered expression levels of APP, PSENs and the different isoforms of APOE are involved in AD pathology, suggesting a role for transcriptional regulation in the disease process.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Variations in functional regulatory elements can therefore be considered risk factors for AD when altering gene expression.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	219	 To date, promoter variations in PSEN1 and APOE have been shown to be associated with increased risk for AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Functional data suggested that the increased risk for AD could be explained by the effect of the promoter variations on transcriptional levels of both genes either by decreasing the levels of total expression (PSEN1) or by differentially influencing the expression levels of different isoforms (APOE).
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Further analysis of the transcriptional regulation of AD genes and of variations in their regulatory regions will lead to more insight into AD etiology.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	222	Multiple factors, both genetic and environmental, underlie the etiology of complex diseases like AD.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is therefore conceivable that an interplay of discrete transcriptional changes of different genes can influence disease processes.
0.35414052.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Analysis of regulatory regions of disease genes and the effect of variations on gene regulation is therefore very important for the elucidation of complex disease processes.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	6	 It has been proposed that at least two other polymorphisms in the promoter of the APOE gene ( to 219G > T and  to 491A > T) might also contribute to disease susceptibility, and modulate the impact of structural changes in the ApoE protein, by altering its expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In order to assess the extent of cis-acting influences on APOE expression in human brain, highly quantitative measures of allele discrimination were applied to cortical RNA from individuals heterozygous for the epsilon alleles.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A small, but significant, increase in the expression of 4 allele was observed relative to that of the 3 and 2 alleles (P < 0.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Similar differences were observed in brain tissue from confirmed LOAD subjects, and between cortical regions BA10 (frontopolar) and BA20 (inferior temporal).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Stratification of 4/3 allelic expression ratios according to heterozygosity for the  to 219G > T promoter polymorphism revealed significantly lower relative expression of haplotypes containing the  to 219T allele (P=0.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our data indicate that, in human brain, most of the cis-acting variance in APOE expression is accounted for by the 4 haplotype, but there are additional, small, cis-acting influences associated with promoter genotype.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) serves a central role in lipid metabolism and is the major apolipoprotein synthesized in brain (1).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The ApoE protein exists as three common isoforms (designated ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4), resulting from two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the APOE gene.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These isoforms differentially impact on a variety of biological parameters, including plasma cholesterol levels (2), neurite outgrowth (3) and amyloid deposition (4).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	15	Possession of the 4 allele of the APOE gene (encoding ApoE4) is the only undisputed genetic risk factor for the common, late-onset, form of Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), increasing risk in a dose-dependent manner (5,6).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, the 4 allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for expression of the disease, and a large proportion of 4 homozygotes surviving to 80 years do not show cognitive impairment (7).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The 2 allele (encoding ApoE2) confers a protective effect (8).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	18	It has been postulated that, in addition to the structural changes in ApoE, cis-acting variation within APOE regulatory sequence might also contribute to disease susceptibility, by influencing gene expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Transgenic mouse models indicate that APOE dosage can significantly influence pathological hallmarks of human Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition and neuritic degeneration (9,10).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, that cis-acting regulatory variants in human APOE have the potential to influence LOAD susceptibilty is suggested by a study in which variation in quantitative measures of peripheral lipid metabolism were better explained by considering genotype data from additional polymorphic sites in the vicinity of APOE, rather than 2 to 4 status alone (11).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It should, however, be noted that the implications of that study for Alzheimer's disease are unknown, as it is unclear if those aspects of APOE function as indexed by peripheral lipid metabolism are relevant to LOAD pathogenesis.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, the extent of cis-acting influences on APOE expression in human brain is also currently unclear.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	23	A powerful method for investigating cis-acting influences on gene expression involves comparing the relative level of each mRNA transcript in individuals who are heterozygous for an expressed polymorphism.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This  within-subjects  approach can allow detection of genuine cis-acting effects, whilst controlling for the trans-acting factors than can confound measures of total expression between samples.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	25	 One such study, using an RFLP-based assay, reported evidence for intrinsic effects of epsilon status on APOE mRNA expression in brain, with 3 expression being greatly increased relative to 4 in 34 heterozygotes (12).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Elevated 3 expression was observed in both LOAD cases and controls, although, in the former, the magnitude of the difference was smaller.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, these findings were not replicated in a subsequent study, in which the potential methodological shortcomings of RFLP-based assays were clearly demonstrated (13).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	28	Molecular genetic studies provide some support for association between LOAD and two polymorphisms in the promoter of APOE, denoted  to 491A > T and  to 219G > T (also known as Th1/E47cs) (14 to 16).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Both polymorphisms have been shown to influence APOE expression in vitro (17), raising the possibility that the association is a direct result of cis-acting effects on gene expression, rather than by virtue of linkage disequilibrium (LD).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	30	Given the importance of APOE as a risk factor for LOAD, and the potential importance of variation in APOE expression, we have undertaken a thorough investigation of the allelic expression of APOE in human brain using highly quantitative measures of allele discrimination (18,19) in a large series of heterozygous samples.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Our objectives were to establish whether epsilon status influences APOE expression in brain, and to determine the extent to which APOE expression is subject to other cis-acting influences, in particular the effects of promoter polymorphisms of current interest in Alzheimer's disease research.

0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	109	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Using a highly quantitative method of allele discrimination (18,19), we have compared the relative expression of the APOE 2, 3 and 4 alleles in brain RNA from individual heterozygotes.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	110	 By comparing the relative expression of alleles within individuals, the assay has a perfect internal control for variables such as RNA quality, disease status (with the exception of multiplicative effects between other risk factors and gene expression), cell loss as a result of degenerative changes and the trans-acting effects of other loci or environmental factors (e.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	111	 cause of death, drug treatment, nutritional status, etc.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	112	 All of these variables can be expected to influence each allelic variant of mRNA equally.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The assay therefore permits detection of small cis-acting influences on gene expression, even with a background of large inter-individual variation in total gene expression, a feature that has been previously observed in studies of total APOE mRNA expression (20).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	114	 A further advantage is that the assay is robust to secondary effects on gene expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	115	 For example, possession of an allele that influences disease as a result of impaired protein function might, by trans-acting homeostatic mechanisms, result in a compensatory increase in gene expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	116	We found increased expression of the 4 allele over that of the 3 allele in 34 heterozygotes, a finding that replicated in two additional samples: LOAD subjects and a mixed population of subjects with neuropsychiatric disorders.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	117	 We also observed a small increase in relative 3 expression in 23 individuals, but this finding did not replicate in the small number of neuropsychiatric patients in which this genotype was observed.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Although not a comprehensive survey of different brain regions, analysis of the frontal and temporal cortex yielded no evidence for differences by neuroanatomical region.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	119	The relatively small difference in allele ratio observed in 34 heterozygotes in this study is in stark contrast with the findings of a previous study (12), where an RFLP-based design was used.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In that study, a large increase was observed in the level of 3 relative to 4 mRNA in both control and LOAD samples, although smaller differences were seen in the LOAD group.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Our data are more compatible with those of a subsequent study (13), in which no major differences in the expression of the two alleles were found in either control or LOAD 34 heterozygotes.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	122	 It is also notable that, in the subsequent study (13), an average 4% relative increase in 4 expression was found, with a maximum of 22%.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Using an RFLP-based design similar to the previous study, they also showed that estimation of allele ratio using this method is critically dependent on the number of PCR cycles (due to digestion-resistant heteroduplex formation), suggesting that the former results were due to artefact.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The primer extension method used in the present study is unaffected by this problem and thus the present data are likely to provide a more accurate estimate of relative allelic expression of brain APOE.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	125	The small increase in 4 expression observed in this study could possibly reflect an intrinsic effect of the alleles on transcription efficiency or RNA stability.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Alternatively, the finding may reflect strong LD between the 2 to 4 conferring haplotype and an untested regulatory variant, of which there may be many (11).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Increased representation of the 4 allele is unlikely to have resulted from differences in PCR or primer extension efficiency, as this is controlled (and corrected for) by concurrent assay of genomic DNA under the same conditions.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Although a genomic control cannot be applied to limit potential confounding from differential RT efficiency, neither is this phenomenon likely to explain the observed differences for 34 heterozygotes, as inter-individual differences in ratios were largely preserved between separate RT reactions.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	129	Our finding of increased expression of the 4 allele at the RNA level is consistent with a recent study in which the encoded ApoE4 isoform was found to account for an elevated proportion of total ApoE protein in the CSF of 34 heterozygotes (21).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This finding is in contrast to measures of ApoE4 in plasma (2,21), where it is associated with lower protein expression, suggesting important allele-specific differences in the CNS and periphery in the control of synthesis and/or degradation of ApoE.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	131	The magnitude of 4 over-expression was found to be virtually identical between the initial sample and the sample of confirmed LOAD cases.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The initial sample was not selected to be a specific control group for the LOAD sample, and although it did not contain any individual with a diagnosis of AD, it is possible that some individuals might have developed the disease had they survived to old age.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, that no differences were observed between this sample and confirmed LOAD cases is consistent with previous comparisons using age-matched control groups in terms of both relative 4 RNA expression (13) and the relative level of ApoE4 protein (21), suggesting that, if there are common risk factors for LOAD that influence risk of disease by altering APOE expression, they do not selectively interact to markedly increase the expression of specific APOE mRNA species.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	134	Though significant, the influence of cis-acting polymorphisms on steady-state levels of APOE mRNA in cerebral cortex is small, with a maximum relative difference in expression observed in this study of 25%.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The 56 APOE heterozygotes assayed in this study provided  > 99% power to detect the effect of a distinct regulatory variant occurring in the general population at a frequency of 0.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	136	05, and almost 90% power to detect the effect of one present at a frequency of 0.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This degree of power effectively excludes the existence of even fairly rare polymorphisms in and around APOE, exerting large direct effects on net APOE mRNA expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	138	The third objective of this study was to determine if APOE mRNA levels in vivo are influenced by polymorphisms that affect transcription activity in vitro, and which have, in several studies, been associated with LOAD.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Stratification of observed 4/3 allele ratios according to heterozygosity for the promoter polymorphisms indicated a very small but statistically significant effect of the  to 219G > T polymorphism on allelic expression, consistent with it having a functional effect in brain.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The  to 219T allele has previously been associated with reduced transcriptional activity in vitro (17) and with reduced plasma ApoE in vivo (22).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The present finding of a reduced ratio of 4/3 expression when the probability is that the 4 allele is in phase with the  to 219T allele, and the 3 allele in phase with the  to 219G allele, suggests that the  to 219T allele also decreases APOE expression in brain.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	142	 As with measures of total expression, our data do not allow us to distinguish between direct and indirect association, but the consistency of our finding with in vitro studies suggests that this is a direct effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	143	The conditional probabilities for diplotypes suggest that, for 15% of  to 219G > T heterozygotes (i.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	144	 two of the 13), the higher expression  to 219G allele is in phase with 4 in 34 individuals.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	145	 As we do not know which, if any, individual diplotypes in this analysis are misclassified, we cannot accurately assess the impact of this on our estimate of the magnitude of effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, if we assume that the two heterozygotes displaying the least reduction in 4/3 ratio are misclassified, we obtain an estimate of the maximum possible size of the effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Excluding these from analysis reveals a mean net effect of the 219T allele of a 6% reduction in relative 4 expression.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We stress that this analysis provides a guide to the maximum effect; we cannot conclude that the effect is of this size because we have no compelling case to exclude any single individual from the analysis.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	149	The  to 491A allele of the  to 491A > G promoter polymorphism has been reported to show higher transcriptional activity in vitro (17), and to be associated with increased measures of total APOE expression in plasma (23) and brain (24).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In the present study, heterozygosity at this site did not significantly influence relative 4 expression in any one direction.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	151	 It should be noted, however, that power to detect a small, directional effect would have been diminished by the small sample size and low predicted consistency of phase.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Interestingly, although only a single observation of all assayed samples, the one showing the greatest elevation in relative 334C (4) expression (25%) was also the only sample in which, with high probability (0.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	153	99), the  to 491A (high expression predicted in vitro) nucleotide was in phase with both  to 219G (high expression in vitro and in this study) and 334C (high expression in this study).
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	154	Our study illustrates the importance of complementing in vivo and in vitro work.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In vitro work requires analysis of the effects of variants in alien genomic and cellular contexts, and therefore the findings must be examined for compatibility in vivo.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Nevertheless, without in vitro work, while associations can be observed, it is impossible to attribute in vivo effects on expression to specific variants.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This would require that the effect of all other cis-acting variants on the same haplotype be controlled for effectively an impossible task, as the relevant variants could be legion, and distributed across large genomic sequences.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	158	To summarize, using a relatively large series of brain samples, we have demonstrated that any common influences on APOE expression attributable to cis-acting polymorphism are small.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	159	 We have also effectively excluded the existence of even fairly rare cis-acting haplotypes of large effect.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Of the variance that does occur, most is accounted for by the 4 haplotype, with the 4 allele of APOE being expressed at a significantly higher level than 3.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	161	 This is highly reproducible and appears to be independent of AD status.
0.3494895.15385439.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We have also shown that the  to 219G promoter allele is associated with higher expression of APOE mRNA in vivo, a finding compatible with previous in vitro studies.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here, we review all 90 studies from 2003 reporting a total of 127 association findings between candidate genes and AD.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Based on these data, we suggest that it may be prudent for investigators to pay closer attention to issues such as power, replicability and haplotype structure prior to initial publication.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Several characteristics make the search for novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes particularly promising.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	 First, and most importantly, the heritability of AD is high.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This has been demonstrated in various studies examining familial segregation of the disease over the past decades (1 to 3).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Accordingly, the probability of actually finding relevant disease-causing or predisposing genes is relatively high as well, possibly even more so than for other genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders, like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or affective disorders (4).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus far, in AD this has been achieved for four genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE), but only variation in the latter also plays a significant role in the most common late-onset form of the disorder (see below).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, on the other hand, lead to rare early-onset familial forms of AD via an increased generation of Ass42 and ss-amyloid deposition, a major neuropathological hallmark of the disease.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Secondly, there is direct evidence, based on simulation as well as empirical data, for the presence of additional AD risk genes besides APOE.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For instance, a recent simulation study predicted the existence of four to seven additional AD genes when searching for age of onset modifiers simulating a variety of different disease and inheritance models (3).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This number corresponds well with empirical data obtained in full genome searches, which overlap on 11 chromosomes, six of which show  significant  results in at least one study (Table 1).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Finally, the progressive neurodegeneration gradually leading to cognitive decline and dementia in AD patients exhibits distinct and well-established histopathological features upon post-mortem examination, allowing for the verification of  clinical  AD (5).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Currently, the accuracy of a clinical AD diagnosis is near or beyond 90% in academic centers (6 to 8).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This allows for a significant reduction of the number of phenocopies in study populations using published research criteria, and thereby increases the power of subsequent genetic or epidemiological analyses.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	24	 On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed .
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Based on these criteria the only  new  AD region to emerge in 2003 is on chromosome 2p23 to 24, at a position between 19 and 29 Mb.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Interestingly, this region was only implicated in studies using association methods and only in fairly isolated and homogeneous populations (i.

0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	43	 As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative .
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	46	 When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	48	 There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	49	 These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	50	 While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	53	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	54	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	55	 the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	57	 While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In practice, however, this still remains the exception.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	59	 A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	60	05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	62	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	65	 If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	67	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	73	 four or more polymorphisms per gene).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	74	Out of all 90 papers published in 2003 on the topic of genetic association between candidate genes and the different AD phenotypes, only 21 (23%) fulfilled at least two of the above criteria.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Most likely, many of the observed discrepancies across studies could be explained by a lack of methodological thoroughness.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Nonetheless, there were three loci, in addition to APOE, that tested positive across at least three studies (on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, and 11q23; Table 2).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	77	 These loci are covered in the remainder of this review.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	78	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	80	 While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	84	 While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	87	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	88	 CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	92	 While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	93	 the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	96	 (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	99	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	101	 While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	102	 CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	103	 GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	105	Chromosome 11q23 The region near the tip of the long arm of chromosome 11 has been implicated in only one of the full genome screens published to date (8) (and therefore does not appear in Table 1).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	110	In contrast to these four positive associations, there is an equal number of studies in the literature showing no apparent effects of this BACE polymorphism and AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	111	 However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	114	 As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67).
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	116	   CONCLUSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	117	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   While the year 2003 has been extremely productive in terms of studies examining potential associations between candidate genes and AD phenotypes, the vast majority of results as in previous years remains controversial.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	118	 While in some cases this could be due to factors that are disease-specific (e.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	119	 larger than anticipated genetic heterogeneity and/or very small effect sizes of individual risk alleles), a good proportion of these controversies are probably caused by methodological issues.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Based on recent empirical and simulation data regarding the genetic make-up of complex diseases and the power of association studies in general, we propose that more attention should be paid to: (i) providing power estimates based on the structure of the analyzed sample for a variety of effect sizes and allele frequencies; (ii) replicating any positive signal in at least one independent population of sufficient size and power prior to initial publication; and (iii) thoroughly assessing the haplotype structure of any investigated locus, especially before reaching any negative conclusions.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Together with statistical techniques that take into account potential interactions with other genetic and non-genetic factors, and that allow for an adequate correction of multiple comparisons, adherence to these criteria should ensure the successful distinction between clinically relevant and irrelevant/false-positive findings.
0.28218916.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Eventually, as in a good vintage of wine, this strategy will elevate the quality of AD genetics research to be on par with its quantity.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this study, we present evidence that, in addition to the known transcript (ApoE S1) that translates into ApoE, there are three additional transcripts in mice.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Two of these transcripts, ApoE S2 and ApoE S3, which are predicted to be transmembrane proteins, are transcribed from the sense strand.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	8	 ApoE AS1 is transcribed from the antisense strand and is complementary to exon 4 of ApoE S1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The open reading frame of ApoE AS1 is conserved between human and mouse.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The antisense transcript falls within the region of the human epsilon 4 allele that has been linked to the familial onset form of Alzheimer's disease.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We also demonstrate the expression of ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 in ApoE knockout mice, and ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 do not get transcribed.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We had previously identified ApoE S1 as being upregulated in mice after spinal cord injury.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In this study, we show that in spinal cord-injured C57BL/6 mice, both ApoE S1 and ApoE S3 transcripts are 10-fold upregulated and the antisense ApoE AS1 is 100-fold upregulated compared with normal levels.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Such data suggest that these alternate transcripts are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of CNS disease and perhaps in ApoE expression in general, as we show that ApoE S2 and AS1 are also transcribed in human.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The molecule apolipoprotein E (ApoE), originally found in the liver where it associates with plasma lipoproteins, is a 34 kDa glycosylated protein, which was first shown to be a plasma protein involved in systemic lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport [1].
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This molecule has two structural domains, the N-terminus (residues 1 to 191) which can bind a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and can interact with heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and the C terminus (residues 222 to 299) which has a high affinity for lipids and is responsible for lipoprotein binding (2 to 4).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These subunits are connected by a flexible and unstructured region encompassing amino acids 191 to 216 (3).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	18	ApoE is also synthesized and secreted by most tissues including the CNS, spleen, kidney, adrenal glands, large intestine and lung (5,6) and is associated with cardiovascular and CNS disease through its use of different alleles of the same gene (7 to 10).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In the CNS, the 4 ApoE allelic form was identified and shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (9).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	20	ApoE is thought to be important in the normal functioning of neural tissue and in response to injury, although the exact mechanisms are not clear.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It has been shown to be synthesized and secreted by both astrocytes (6,11) and monocytes (12,13).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The finding that ApoE is in neurons in the brain (14) is explained by the presence of ApoE receptors and reflect the uptake of the molecule (15).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Using a spinal cord injury model (16), we previously showed that both ApoE mRNA and protein levels are upregulated after spinal cord injury in the mouse (17).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	24	The effects of knocking out the ApoE gene have been studied in mice (18).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Creation of the knockout involved the insertion of the neomycin resistance gene by homologous recombination in place of exon 3 and part of intron 3 of the ApoE gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Mice that were heterozygous for the knockout gene were reported to be healthy at 3 months of age and produce homozygous knockouts at the expected frequency.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These homozygous knockout progeny appear healthy despite the absence of ApoE in their plasma.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	28	In the present study, we show evidence for two additional mouse sense transcripts generated from the ApoE gene, which could be transmembrane proteins, and an antisense transcript which has an open reading frame in exon 4 that is conserved between mouse and human.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The antisense protein falls within the region of the epsilon 4 allele that has been linked to the familial onset form of Alzheimer's disease (9,19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We also demonstrate the expression of one sense and antisense ApoE transcripts in ApoE knockout mice.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Furthermore, we show that these transcripts are upregulated in B6 mice after spinal cord injury and follow the upregulation of ApoE itself.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Finally, we find that for one of the additional sense transcripts and the antisense transcript, corresponding RNAs exist in human.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In examining the cell types involved, in situ hybridization was carried out using both the ApoE antisense and sense probes (exon 4) on tissue sections.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Both probes produced a signal suggesting the presence of an antisense transcript in exon 4.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For a more complete picture, we looked for such additional transcripts using an in silico approach.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Thereafter, the amino acid sequence is identical to ApoE S1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Starting transcription in such a manner upstream of exon 2 transforms the secretory signal peptide into a transmembrane helix.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	183	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In this study, we have shown that multiple RNAs, in both the sense and antisense orientation, are produced by the mouse and human ApoE gene, thereby adding this gene to a growing list of genes that are known to be transcribed from both strands.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This list is conservatively estimated to number about 1600 or 8% of the genes contained in the human genome (26).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	185	 (27) show that 22% of clusters transcribe sense to antisense pairs, the highest number so far supported by EST evidence.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Matching accession numbers with their data, it was found that ApoE was not one of the genes.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, the number of genes that transcribe from both strands identified so far show that antisense transcription has been greatly underestimated in its contribution to genomic complexity.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	188	One set of ApoE transcripts that we identified code for putative transmembrane proteins, one of which is frame shifted, the other is an antisense RNA.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Both sense and antisense messages have sequences recognized as translation start sites and therefore could exist as protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Examples demonstrating the expression of antisense message have been shown for a variety of genes (reviewed in 28 and 29) including urocortin (30), cardiac troponin (31) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (32).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The scenario we describe here for ApoE most closely resembles that of bFGF expression.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The bFGF gene locus is known to be transcribed into multiple mRNA products, including at least one antisense transcript.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This antisense transcript may be involved in regulating gene expression by hybridizing the sense transcript while still in the nucleus and perhaps affecting developmental patterns and tissue differentiation (32).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The bFGF transcript isolated from Xenopus could also, however, be translated into a 25 kDa protein of as yet unknown function (33).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	195	 At this point, it is unclear whether any of our newly identified ApoE transcripts, including the antisense transcript, are in fact translated except for ApoE S2 protein that is found in the serum.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Beyond being translated into a protein, all the transcripts could participate in regulating each other's levels through a process like RNAi.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	197	Marking yet another similarity with bFGF, the antisense transcript is present in both human and mouse (33).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	198	 For the ApoE antisense transcript, we can say that the reading frame is also open in humans and, consequently, there is the possibility that an antisense message is actually translated into a protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The protein predicted from sequence M10065 has 198 amino acids and has a signal peptide predicted by the SignalP-3.

0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In contrast, in the mouse AS1 protein, the same program predicts a signal peptide with a probability of only 0.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Even deleting the first 21 amino acids in the mouse protein that the human protein lacks increases the probability only to 0.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Therefore, even though the human sequence probably enters the secretory pathway, the mouse sequence seems to lack a signal peptide.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	204	0 HMM are focusing on prediction of classical signal peptides, one cannot exclude the presence of other signal motifs in the mouse protein.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	205	The ApoE antisense protein is encoded by exon 4, the exon that accounts for the three major allelic variants in humans.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These allelic variations of the sense protein are defined by the substitution of an arginine (a positively charged polar amino acid) for a cysteine (a non-polar amino acid) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein (35,36).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In the putative antisense protein, an arginine is substituted for a histidine, both positively charged polar amino acids.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Therefore, these two variants are probably affecting the function of the antisense protein less than that of the sense protein and are therefore more conservative in the antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, as studies of allelic variations and their implications in disease have always been conducted in reference to the sense protein, other more prominent variations (Table 1) might lead to functional and more relevant changes.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	210	 One dramatic change is the variation at positions 3817 to 3819 (sequence position in reference to M10065).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The substitution of TAG to GCT on the antisense strand opens the reading frame, so translation can continue for another 113 amino acids.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The E4 allele as published by Paik et al.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	213	 (36) contains a stop codon at positions 3817 to 3819.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	214	 However, at this point, it is not clear if the allelic variation that opens the reading frame is linked with any of the major allelic forms like the E4, E3 or E2 genotype (for some of the observed haplotypes, see Table 1 in 37; for other relative frequencies of ApoE sequence variants within the E4, E3 and E2 genotypes, see Table 3 in 38).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Therefore, an involvement of the putative antisense protein in diseases correlated with the allelic variants cannot be excluded.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	216	 For example, in Alzheimer's disease, the specific molecular pathway by which ApoE modifies the expression of this disease remains elusive (19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Furthermore, other sequence variations in the different alleles (34) that are conservative in the sense direction might lead to amino acid substitutions or even stop signals in the antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Sequence variations of the human ApoE gene (accession no.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	219	: M10065) in relation to ApoE S1 and AS1 protein in intron 3 and exon 4   Even though our sequence work thus far suggests that human ApoE S2 is translated to the same protein as ApoE S1, allelic variation might cause an open reading frame similar to the one seen in C57BL/6 mice, leading to the presence of a transmembrane version of ApoE.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	220	Knockout organisms are created to investigate any phenotypic changes that may take place in that organism in the absence of a gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Our data suggest that the genetic manipulation used to generate the ApoE knockout has only eliminated the expression of ApoE S1 and ApoE S2 transcripts.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We found that both ApoE S3, a putative transmembrane protein with a sequence completely different than that known for the ApoE protein, and ApoE AS1, a protein potentially produced from an antisense transcript, are still expressed in the knockout.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This is possible because the region of the gene responsible for these transcripts, in particular exon 4, has not been disrupted by the insertion of the neo gene in the knockout.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The roles of these transcripts are currently unknown.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In addition, further work must be done to determine whether they are translated in vivo.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	226	An indication of a potentially important role for both the ApoE S3 and ApoE AS1 antisense messages in CNS disease comes from data in our mouse spinal cord injury model (16,17).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In response to spinal injury, both of these transcripts are upregulated and follow the expression pattern of ApoE S1.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	228	 However, as ApoE AS1 is 10-fold more upregulated than either ApoE S1 or S3 it might also be involved in influencing their translation.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Again, it would be useful to know if either of the alternate mRNAs is translated in response to spinal injury.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	230	ApoE is a lipoprotein, a class of proteins responsible for carrying cholesterol and other fats through the bloodstream as little packages and essential for the normal breakdown of these molecules.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In particular, ApoE is a major component of specific lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	232	 A major function of VLDLs is to remove excess cholesterol from the blood and carry it to the liver for processing.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Maintaining normal levels of cholesterol is essential for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and stroke.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	234	 There are at least three slightly different versions of the ApoE gene.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The major versions, or alleles, are called 2, 3 and 4.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The most common allele is 3, which is found in more than half of the population.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Researchers have found that most people with familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol and an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, have two copies of the 2 allele.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This allele seems to be one of several genetic factors that play a part in this disorder.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In addition, ApoE allelic version 4 is a risk factor for coronary artery disease.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	240	 People who inherit at least one copy of the ApoE 4 allele have an increased risk of developing type 2 Alzheimer's disease, which first appears later in life.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Studies have shown that people who inherit two copies of ApoE 4 have the highest chance of developing the disease.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is not yet known how this allele affects a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, it has been found that it increases the number of amyloid plaques, which are characteristic of the disease (9,19).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	243	Finally, EST evidence for an ApoE alternative splice variant in human does exist (41).
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	244	 One EST corresponds to the last exon, which is different for ApoE S2 and S3.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This has been validated by RT to PCR which showed that it is expressed in lung cancer but not as strongly as in normal tissue.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	246	In conclusion, the ApoE protein may play a vital role in the occurrence of a diverse group of maladies.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It now appears that the ApoE gene can be characterized by a complex expression pattern with multiple start sites in the sense and antisense direction.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	248	 As they all have an open reading frame, these transcripts may be translated into proteins.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Work must be done to determine whether the antisense transcript is involved in regulating expression post-transcriptionally, is translated into a novel protein or both.
0.38120866.16091415.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In addition, given the significance of exon 4 in the various allelic versions of ApoE, a knockout of this exon may give insight into its role.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	7	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION References   Apolipoprotein E 4 (APOE*4) is the only fully established susceptibility allele for Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	8	 One of the most studied candidates is the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This study aimed to clarify its association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The meta-analysis included 39 samples, comprising 6,037 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 12,099 controls, using mainly primary data.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Potential interactions with gender, age, ethnic group, and carrier status of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were all examined.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	12	 D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	13	0004); I homozygotes showed no association with Alzheimer's disease, while heterozygotes were at increased risk.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although there were clear differences among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians), in all groups D homozygotes were at reduced risk.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further, in North Europeans, both association and Hardy-Weinberg analysis suggested partial heterosis, that is, an increased risk for heterozygotes, due to a hidden interaction with another, as yet unknown, risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This interaction warrants further investigation.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	20	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION References   In 1999, Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	21	 (1) first proposed an association with Alzheimer's disease of the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) in intron 16 of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) on chromosome 17q23.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is potently hypertensive.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of the enzyme (2, 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (1) found that I positives, that is, DI + II, were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The study comprised three samples, from Cardiff and London in Britain and Belfast in Northern Ireland, with strikingly similar results.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	26	Since then, this potential association has been examined in over 40 samples (4, 5) (table 1) from around the world.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Several studies replicated the report of increased risk for I positives, just a few contradicted it, and many found no association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	28	 One study suggested an effect of age on the association (6), and another proposed an influence of gender (7).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	29	 An association with onset age of Alzheimer's disease has also been proposed (8).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Cohorts used in the meta-analysis of the ACE* insertion-deletion polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	31	  The association has recently been studied in the longitudinal, observational cohorts of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) and the Rotterdam Study (9).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Both groups found a suggestion of a gender difference in their results, consistent with a previous report (7).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We therefore undertook a meta-analysis of studies of the association of the ACE indel with Alzheimer's disease, stratified by gender, by age, by ethnic group, and by apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status, using mainly primary data, supplied by authors.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	34	Although three previous meta-analyses of ACE studies had been reported (10 to 12), subsequent studies have now made further data available.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Compared even with the latest meta-analysis (12), 10 more samples from eight studies were available to us (9, 13 to 18, and the above study of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition, all previous meta-analyses were based on published data, that is, largely unstratified, and were thus limited in the interpretations they allowed.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Using primary data, we were able to explore more deeply, searching for sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Two previous stratified meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease genes (19, 20), based on primary data, have both deepened our understanding.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	39	 (21) have stressed the need to examine sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of case-control studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We therefore divided our analysis into two phases: first, a broad overall analysis and, second, the detailed examination of sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We aimed to discover whether the ACE indel is associated with Alzheimer's disease and, if so, the nature of that association.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	42	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION References   Phase 1: broad analysis In April 2003, following PubMed searches, the study of references and of abstracts, and communication with experts, we wrote to the authors of all association studies of the ACE indel and Alzheimer's disease known to us, 33 studies in all, involving 41 samples (4, 5) (table 1), including seven samples from unpublished studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The searches were updated in November 2004, without further data arising.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For the stratified analyses, we used the raw data or stratified summaries received from authors on 26 samples.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	45	 For the overall analyses, we also used published data, making 39 samples altogether (table 1).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Very early onset cases ( < 50 years) and young controls ( < 50 years) were excluded, where identifiable, as were subjects with incomplete data.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Distinct populations were treated separately, where possible.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The large number of controls in the cohort of Sleegers et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	49	 (9) had all been fully assessed (22).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	50	 All samples had been genotyped for the ACE indel, except for the two of Prince et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	51	 (23, 24), who had used the ACE rs4343 marker, which is in 85 to 90 percent linkage disequilibrium with the indel in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	52	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six possible sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	53	 We performed analyses stratified by age, gender, and APOE*4 status.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For the age stratifications ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years), we divided the samples into two groups, according to how the ages of cases had been defined, for example, at onset (first group) or at examination or death (second group).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also conducted analyses restricted to controls and to diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (25) or of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (26) (26 full samples and two part samples).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In separate analyses, we excluded eight samples where Hardy-Weinberg analysis and genotyping methods were compatible with mistyping.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Underreporting of heterozygotes may occur unless either 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide is included in the polymerase chain reaction (27) or the DD genotype is confirmed by an insertion-specific second amplification (28).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In further analyses, samples were placed where possible (34 of 39 samples) in one of three ethnic groups: North European (19 samples); South Caucasian (11 samples), defined here as from the Mediterranean or from the Middle East; and East Asian (four samples), from China or from Japan.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	59	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	60	 I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	61	 DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	62	 All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	63	 For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	65	 We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	66	 We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	68	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Analyses were performed using "R" (35) and the package "rmeta" by Thomas Lumley (http://www.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	75	org/src/contrib/Descriptions/rmeta.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	76	 All tests of significance were two sided.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	77	 A Bonferroni correction factor of 3 was applied to all p values by genotype.

0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Onset age data were available from 13 samples, comprising 2,309 cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Both stratified analyses and linear regression analysis were performed on these data and also on a subset of 10 North European samples, comprising 1,822 cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	126	 No effect of ACE*I carrier status on onset age of Alzheimer's disease and, surprisingly, only a modest effect of APOE*4 carrier status on onset age were seen (data not shown).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	127	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six potential sources of heterogeneity: age, gender, race, APOE*4 status, misdiagnosis, and mistyping.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	128	Stratification by gender and by APOE*4 status.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	129	 No significant effects were seen of gender or of APOE*4 status on the associations with Alzheimer's disease, nor did stratification by either of these two factors remove the heterogeneity (data not shown).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We calculated the odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for ACE*D homozygotes versus I positives when stratified by age ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Rather little effect of age was seen on the association of D homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease (data not shown), nor was there any reduction in heterogeneity on stratification by age.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	132	 We repeated the overall analyses of the three genotypes, restricting the data to the 28 samples that could be limited to the more rigorous diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (25) or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (26).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The odds ratios were similar to those shown in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios by the method of DerSimonian and Laird (30) of 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	134	15 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Heterogeneity remained for D homozygotes (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	136	005) but was no longer significant (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	137	 There were 12 instances of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in individual studies and four in the six groups of pooled cases and controls analyzed by race (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We therefore excluded the eight samples where mistyping was considered possible, that is, underreporting of heterozygotes, taking into account both genotyping methods and Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We then repeated the overall analyses with the remaining 31 samples.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The odds ratios were similar to those in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios of 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	141	12 for heterozygotes and a nonsignificant odds ratio of 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Heterogeneity remained for I homozygotes (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	143	02) but was no longer significant for D homozygotes (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for each ACE* genotype in the meta-analysis, by ethnic group.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The samples were divided into three ethnic groups, where possible: North European (19 samples), South Caucasian (Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, 11 samples), and East Asian (Chinese and Japanese, four samples).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Table 3 shows clear differences among the three ethnic groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	148	 There was no overlap whatsoever in allelic frequencies among the three groups.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	149	 North Europeans and East Asians differed in the odds ratios for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	150	0008) and for I homozygotes versus D positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	151	 South Caucasians also differed from East Asians in the odds ratio for D homozygotes versus I positives (p = 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	152	 D homozygotes were at reduced risk in all groups, but particularly in East Asians.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	154	 I homozygotes were at higher risk in East Asians, except by Bayesian analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	156	 We found that heterozygotes were at higher risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	157	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	158	45) but not significantly higher than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	159	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	160	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION References   This was a large meta-analysis, by the standards of Alzheimer's disease genetics, with 39 samples, comprising 6,037 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 12,099 elderly controls (table 1).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	161	 We found no evidence of publication bias.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	162	ACE*D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (table 2) in each of the three main ethnic groups examined (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	163	 I homozygotes were neutral as regards Alzheimer's disease risk (table 2), except in East Asians, in whom I homozygotes may be at higher risk (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease overall (table 2) and mainly in North Europeans (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This example of heterosis will be discussed below.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Very similar results were achieved by three methods: fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian random effects (refer to Materials and Methods and table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Only genotypic comparisons were made (refer to Materials and Methods), which showed that there was no allelic dose effect, except in East Asians (table 3), and that thus allelic comparisons would have proved less informative.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	168	These findings of odds ratios close to 1, even though significantly different from 1 (tables 2 and 3), suggest either linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor or confounding by a hidden interaction or both.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The second possibility is discussed below.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Regarding the former, Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	171	 (1) in their study of ACE haplotypes gave evidence that the indel may not be the actual risk factor but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby functional polymorphism that is the true risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	172	 ACE haplotype analysis has also proved of value with other phenotypes, such as enzyme levels (36), insulin levels, myocardial infarction, and obesity (37).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Future Alzheimer's disease studies may do better to examine polymorphisms in the regulatory regions, rather than the indel.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	174	The overall results were consistent with those of Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	175	 (1) from 1999 and also with those of the recent meta-analyses of Kehoe et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	176	 (11) from 2003 and of Elkins et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The latter report (12) also suggested an age difference, however, although actual ages were not available to them, only mean cohort ages, and they did not take into account the different ways of defining case ages (refer to Materials and Methods), a strongly confounding factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Because of the latter problem, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association might be stronger in younger cases, for example, in those aged less than 65 years at onset or less than 75 years at death.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	179	Heterogeneity Our overall results showed heterogeneity (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	181	, in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	182	, of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	183	, in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	185	 We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	189	However, the greatest source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Ethnic stratification removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	191	 There were clear contrasts among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians) in allelic frequencies and in odds ratios (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The latter might be due to differences in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (see above).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Some of these ethnic differences had previously been pointed out by Panza et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	197	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We believe that explanation is heterosis.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	206	 To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	211	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	212	45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	213	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Model to show how heterosis may follow from the combination of two unlike subsets.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	216	  A hidden interaction Partial heterosis in North Europeans suggests an interaction with another risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, another potential source of heterogeneity.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Candidates include cardiovascular risk factors, since many also contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk and since the ACE indel has been associated with cardiovascular risk (43 to 47).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	218	Biologic background Full discussion of the biologic basis of these associations is outside the scope of this mainly analytical study.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	221	 (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	223	 There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	224	 However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	226	 A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	227	Limitations of this meta-analysis The lack of information from some authors was a limitation, but we obtained full data on 84 percent of subjects.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	229	 There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	233	 However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	235	Conclusions We suggest that this large study has established the ACE indel as a marker of Alzheimer's disease risk, since we found no evidence of bias, we found and removed the main sources of heterogeneity, we excluded various potential interactions, and significant results remained in each of the three ethnic groups examined.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The indel, however, is probably in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (11).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	237	 There were marked contrasts among the three ethnic groups studied (table 3).
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We also found evidence of an interaction with another risk factor in North Europeans.
0.3345159.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Potential interactions with other factors than age, gender, and APOE*4 status should be examined, particularly interactions with cardiovascular risk factors.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both estradiol and ApoE3, the most common isoform of human ApoE, increase the extent of neurite outgrowth in culture.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Combined, these observations suggest a common mechanism whereby estrogen may increase ApoE levels to facilitate neurite growth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the effects of estradiol and ApoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth in cultured adult mouse cortical neurons.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Estradiol increased ApoE levels and neurite outgrowth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	16	 ApoE2 increased neurite length more so than ApoE3 in the presence of estradiol.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The majority of epidemiological studies suggest a history of ERT decreases the likelihood of developing late-life dementia (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, in the Women s Health Initiative trial, the continuous estrogen-plus-progestin arm, which was discontinued early, found no protection from dementia and perhaps a slight increase in risk (7, 8).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A history of ERT also may delay either the onset or progression of Parkinson disease (PD) (9, 10, 11, 12).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These studies are also mixed with some reporting no change in risk (9).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, the rate of clinical progression of multiple sclerosis is attenuated by estrogen (13, 14).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The disagreement in studies emphasizes our lack of a clear understanding of the mechanism whereby steroid replacement may decrease risk of neurological diseases.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	30	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) modifies the risks for several chronic neurological diseases.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Humans have three major isoforms of ApoE (ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4) that are produced by three alleles, 2, 3, and 4, at a single gene locus on chromosome 19 (15, 16).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Inheritance of 4 increases the risk and rate of progression of late-onset Alzheimer disease (17, 18, 19).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Individuals with 4 alleles also appear to have an earlier age of onset of PD and a greater risk of developing dementia in PD (20, 21).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Additionally, 4 inheritance increases the risk of developing dementia after head trauma (22, 23, 24) and increases the severity of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (25, 26).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	35	Neuronal repair may be a common factor in these diseases.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Estradiol and ApoE independently facilitate neurite/process outgrowth in vivo and in vitro.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Estradiol increases the complexity of neuritic growth and axonal elongation in vitro (27, 28, 29).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Neuronal repair after brain lesion is more rapid in the presence of estradiol (30, 31).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	39	 ApoE, similar to estrogen, has dramatic effects on neurite outgrowth from a variety of cultured neurons.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	40	 ApoE3 increases neurite outgrowth, whereas the absence of ApoE or treatment with ApoE4 either decreases or has no effect on neurite outgrowth (32, 33, 34).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Neuropathological studies have documented deficits in dendritic growth and plasticity in brains of ApoE4 individuals (35).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	42	 ApoE appears to be a critical element in neuronal growth and repair.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	43	ApoE levels in the CNS vary during the estrous cycle (36) and several studies show that estradiol can increase ApoE in vivo (36, 37) and in vitro (38, 39).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In sum, these observations suggest a generalized mechanism whereby estrogen could increase ApoE levels.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	45	 ApoE levels could then facilitate process regrowth after injury.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	46	 We tested this hypothesis in cultured neurons from adult mice.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We found that the presence of ApoE2 or ApoE3 was necessary to obtain an effect of estrogen on neurite outgrowth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In addition, our data suggest that ApoE isoforms have differential rates of internalizaton and lipid transport into neurons.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Generally, these effects increase survival or process extension.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The general assumption of these studies is that there is only a direct effect of estradiol on neuronal activation and growth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	288	 This assumption may be too simplistic.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Our data suggest that ApoE plays an important role in neuronal activation and growth stimulated by estradiol.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	290	Previous data suggest that glia are the primary source of ApoE (45, 46, 47) and our studies with ApoE tg mice support this.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Therefore, we selected a mixed culture derived from adult mouse brain to evaluate estradiol effects on ApoE levels and neuronal process growth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Adult cortical neuronal cultures contain both microglia and astroglia early in the culture.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Our previous study showed that neurons comprise 70% of total cells, astroglia 15% and microglia 15% at 4 DIV (33).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Glial-derived factors are important in synaptogenesis (see Ref.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	295	 48) and inclusion of glia in the culture may be required to see a broader spectrum of the effects of estrogen on neurons in vitro.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	296	 For example, a previous report has shown that both microglia and astroglia must be present to obtain an estrogen-induced increase in ApoE mRNA (38).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Hence, a monotypic cell culture may give a biased interpretation of critical estradiol effects if interactions exist between glia and neurons.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	298	Data from previous studies suggest a direct relationship between ApoE and neurite outgrowth (32, 33, 34, 49, 50).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We found that a physiological concentration of estradiol had a maximal effect on both ApoE levels and neurite outgrowth.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Our data also suggest a synergistic effect between estradiol and ApoE such that estradiol effects on neurite outgrowth are facilitated by ApoE3 but not by ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	301	 ApoE3 alone increased neurite extent by about 30%.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	302	 But when combined with estradiol, neuritic growth increased by 70 to 80%.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	303	 In addition, ApoE2 was significantly more effective than ApoE3 in facilitating neurite outgrowth in the presence of estradiol.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	304	 This effect corresponds to studies that suggest a protective effect of ApoE2 in dementia (see Ref.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In addition, the differential effects of ApoE3 vs.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	306	 ApoE4 were confirmed by using tg mice expressing ApoE3 or ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Estrogen increased the levels of both ApoE3 and ApoE4 to a similar extent in adult cultures derived from ApoE3- and ApoE4-tg mice; however, only the ApoE3 isoform was effective in facilitating neurite outgrowth in the presence of estradiol.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	308	A partial mechanism for differential effects of ApoE3 and ApoE4 is suggested by our uptake studies.

0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Estradiol may stimulate neurons to extend processes and concurrently stimulate astroglia (and perhaps microglia) to produce ApoE.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Glial-derived ApoE supplies lipids for neuronal membrane synthesis and function.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Our receptor inhibition studies suggest that both ApoE3 and ApoE4 are using low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein and HSPG for neurite outgrowth (33, 49).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	314	 However, neuronal growth is slowed or disrupted in the absence of ApoE or in the presence of ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	315	 It is worth noting that ApoE4 has been reported to show toxic effects in culture (52) and disrupt microtubule polymerization although at 10-fold higher concentrations of those used in this study (32).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Hence, the less complex neuritic field seen in the cells incubated with ApoE4 may represent a deficiency of lipid in combination with toxic effects of ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	317	Process extension during neuronal repair in vivo may be a critical factor for the rate of progression in some chronic neurological diseases.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	318	 In dementia or after trauma, degeneration and repair may be in dynamic balance.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Dementia or cognitive decline may occur when degenerative processes exceed regenerative responses.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	320	 ApoE4 may tip the scales to slower or incomplete regeneration and accelerate cognitive decline more rapidly than ApoE2 or ApoE3.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Of interest is that ApoE4 has been shown to be a dominant-negative factor in mice expressing both ApoE3 and ApoE4 (49, 53).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	322	 ERT may be less protective in those with 4 allele, which has been previously noted (54).
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	323	 The full benefit of ERT in protection from some chronic neurological diseases may be compromised by the presence of ApoE4.
0.31636134.15033916.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Clinical studies to evaluate protective effects of ERT or estradiol-like compounds may need to consider ApoE genotype to obtain optimal efficacy.

0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	7	 ApoE gene transfer may thus ameliorate a hyperlipidaemic profile and have beneficial effects at lesion sites to prevent or regress atherosclerosis, a concept endorsed by adenoviral-mediated hepatic expression studies.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here, using plasmid vectors expressing allelic human apoE2 or apoE3 isoforms, skeletal muscle was evaluated as an effective secretory platform for apoE gene augmentation.

0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Human apoE mRNA was detected by RT to PCR in injected muscles and, although concentrations of apoE3, which is rapidly cleared from plasma, were near ELISA detection limits, levels of plasma apoE2 were measurable (17.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	12	 To assess whether muscle-based expression of apoE2 could inhibit atherogenesis, long-term follow-up studies were conducted.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Although hyperlipidaemia was not reduced in treated animals, end-point pathology showed clear retardation of atherosclerotic and xanthomatous lesions.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Up to 9 months following a single apoE2 plasmid administration, atherosclerotic lesion coverage in proximal aorta was significantly reduced by 20 to 30% (P  <  0.

0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We conclude that expression of apoE from ectopic muscle sites has therapeutic potential to limit progression of atherosclerosis.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	17	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Human apoE is a 34 kDa polymorphic protein associated with the surface of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDLs), or their remnants] and certain high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (1 to 3).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Of the three major isoforms, the rarest variant, apoE2, is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinaemia (4,5) and differs from wild-type apoE3 by an R158C substitution; apoE4 (C112R) produces a dominant hyperlipidaemia (6) and is implicated in re-stenosis (7).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	19	 ApoE protects against coronary heart disease, in part by mediating the hepatic clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins through two receptors, the LDL-receptor and the LDL-receptor related protein (LRP), with a differential binding activity (E4  >  E3  >  E2) (8).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	20	Low apoE is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (9,10), whereas severe hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis ensues in humans or animal models if apoE is dysfunctional or absent (11,12).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Expression of apoE3Leiden or apoE4Arg142Cys in mice, both natural variants, produces a type III hyperlipidaemia phenotype (13,14), whereas apoE-deficient (apoE to / to ) mice are markedly hypercholesterolaemic and develop spontaneous atherosclerosis (15 to 17).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In contrast, apoE infusion into hyperlipidaemic rabbits reduces plasma cholesterol and regresses atheromatic lesions (18), whereas apoE transgenic mice over-expressing apoE rapidly clear VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and resist diet-induced or diabetic hyperlipidaemia (19,20).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These findings suggest that gene-based strategies to correct dysfunctional apoE will be atheroprotective.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Indeed, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of human apoE3 to the liver of apoE to / to  mice reverses their hyperlipidaemia and restricts lesion progression (21,22).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	25	Increasing evidence suggests that skeletal muscle can serve as an efficient secretory platform for circulating proteins (23 to 28).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, the direct injection of plasmid vector into muscle for the permanent systemic delivery of apoE may offer significant advantages over viral-transduction of hepatocytes.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Here, we show that cultured mouse C2C12 myoblast and myotube cells transfected with plasmids encoding human apoE2 and apoE3 cDNAs secrete apoE protein and then, in a short-term experiment, demonstrate that injecting the plasmids into the regenerating muscle of apoE to / to  mice results in detectable expression of apoE and secretion into plasma.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, in long-term studies of 6 or 9 months, we show that injection of the pCMVapoE2 vector restricts lesion and xanthomata formation, even though there was no improvement in the hyperlipidaemia.

0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To evaluate long-term effects of ectopic muscle-based expression of apoE following intramuscular plasmid injection, atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma formation were examined up to 9 months following intramuscular plasmid injection.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	70	 As pCMVapoE2 produced measurable levels of apoE in plasma (Table 1), this vector was used for injection.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Mice at 6 to 8 weeks old were subjected to a single regime of intramuscular pCMVapoE2 plasmid injection and sacrificed 6 or 9 months later; control animals received pCMV( to ).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Animals were dissected and evaluated for the presence of gross bilateral xanthoma by physical examination and for aortic atheroma by quantitative morphometry as described in Materials and Methods.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	73	In the 6 month group, all untreated mice had visible macroscopic dorsal xanthoma and 3 of 5 scored with a diameter of  > 5 mm (Table 2; Fig.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	74	 In contrast, in the plasmid-injected group of animals, no animals had dorsal xanthoma of  > 5 mm (Table 2): in this group, four of five animals exhibited no macroscopically visible xanthoma and one had clear xanthoma formation but of  < 5 mm.

0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	87	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Cultured mouse C2C12 muscle cells which had been transfected with pCMVapoE2/3 expression vectors efficiently synthesized and secreted recombinant human apoE, whether grown as mononucleated myoblasts or differentiated into post-mitotic multinucleate myotubes.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This implies that injection of plasmid vector into skeletal muscle would result in apoE expression and this was confirmed by direct measurements when apoE2 was clearly detected in plasma 6 days following intramuscular injection of plasmid into apoE to / to  mice.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Release of the corresponding protein into plasma following intramuscular injection of expression vector plasmids has been reported for several different proteins, including decorin, endostatin, -galactosidase, factor IX, growth hormone and erythropoietin (25 to 28).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	90	ApoE to / to  mice are recognized as a valuable model of human atherosclerosis (34).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The animals are grossly hypercholesterolaemic on normal chow, exhibit spontaneous xanthoma formation and develop atheroma in coronary arteries from 2 months.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Widespread fibroproliferative atherosclerotic lesions then evolve to form fibrous plaques with smooth muscle cell caps and necrotic cores at 5 months, whereas near-total occlusion of the coronary artery ostium and profound atheroma is observed at 8 months.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In our 6 day study, intramuscular injection of pCMVapoE2 or of pCMVapoE3 did not reduce plasma lipid levels; nor were reductions seen in the long-term studies when single or double injections of pCMVapoE2 were used.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	94	 This may largely reflect a low efficiency of gene expression and apoE synthesis and secretion.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Thus, although plasma apoE as low as 0.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	96	4  microg/ml, compared with a normal level of 30 to 60  microg/ml, can effectively reduce plasma cholesterol (35), this concentration was not reached in our study.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The lower level of plasma apoE3 compared with apoE2 is most likely explained by its increased binding affinity for hepatic LRP, the receptor responsible for clearing remnant lipoproteins after lipolysis (11).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Similar results have been described in Yoshida Wistar rats receiving an intramuscular injection of naked plasmid DNA, where local expression of human apoE3 was demonstrated in the muscle but no recombinant protein could be detected in plasma (36).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In line with this study, here we observed the local expression of both apoE2 and apoE3 cDNA in treated muscles of apoE knockouts, but plasma accumulation of only recombinant apoE2 protein.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	100	 This effect is presumably due to reduced plasma clearance and liver uptake of the exogenous apoE2 compared with apoE3 and, accordingly, the expression of low levels of apoE2 did not significantly alter plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	101	Despite the unchanged hyperlipidaemia, the end-point pathologies 6 and 9 months following gene transfer showed clear evidence of atherosclerotic plaque and xanthoma retardation in animals treated with pCMVapoE2.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	102	 We believe that this inhibition reflects anti-atherogenic actions of apoE at lesion sites.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Although most plasma apoE is secreted by the liver, a significant proportion (10%) is macrophage-derived and transplantation of bone marrow from normal mice into apoE to / to  animals prevents development of atherosclerosis (37,38).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In part, this represents the ability of macrophage-derived apoE to promote clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins and reduce serum cholesterol concentration (39).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, low-dose expression of human or mouse apoE transgenes in macrophages of apoE to / to  mice (giving a plasma apoE of 5% of wild-type levels) inhibits atherogenesis without correcting the hyperlipidaemia (40).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This implies direct atheroprotective effects of apoE in the artery wall, a view endorsed by the abundance of apoE in atherosclerotic lesions (41) and by the finding that transfecting endothelium to secrete apoE prevents lesion progression (42).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, although it is clear that endogenous apoE within lesions, supplied by infiltrating macrophages, effectively retards foam cell formation and progression of atherosclerosis, these atheroprotective actions can also be carried out by exogenously derived apoE.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, liver-derived apoE also infiltrates and accumulates within the arterial intima to regress atherosclerosis in apoE to / to  mice (43).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Importantly, studies in transgenic mice expressing adrenal apoE have shown that even low plasma levels (1 to 2% of normal) of extrahepatic, non-macrophage apoE can limit atherosclerosis without reversing the hyperlipidaemia (44); presumably, muscle-derived apoE had a similar effect.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	110	One mechanism by which locally produced apoE is atheroprotective is by enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux, a function largely restored to the plasma of apoE to / to  mice after low-dose expression of the human apoE3 gene in macrophages (41).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Whether this action could contribute to the apoE2-mediated inhibition of atherogenesis seen in our study is uncertain, although there is evidence that efficient cholesterol efflux is not restricted to the apoE3 isoform (45).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Other atheroprotective actions of apoE include inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation (46), reducing oxidative insults (47), restricting platelet aggregation (48) and downregulating VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells (A.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Here there is less isoform dependency: apoE2 has greater antioxidant activity than apoE3, whereas our own studies on the anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory properties of apoE did not find an obvious difference between isoforms (48).
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	114	Increasingly, skeletal muscle is being proposed as an important target for cell-mediated gene therapy.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Muscle tissues are stable with little nuclear turnover, are well vascularized and actively secretory and readily accessible for gene delivery.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The present study shows for the first time that expression of even very low levels of apoE from ectopic muscle sites has therapeutic potential to limit progression of atherosclerosis.
0.29964596.11030760.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, further studies are needed to critically evaluate this strategy, including the use of more efficient vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors (49,50).

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received for publication, February 24, 2005 , and in revised form, April 25, 2005.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a chaperone for the amyloid (A) peptide, regulates the deposition and structure of A that deposits in the brain in Alzheimer disease (AD).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The primary apoE receptor that regulates levels of apoE in the brain is unknown.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report that the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) regulates the cellular uptake and central nervous system levels of astrocyte-derived apoE.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Cells lacking LDLR were unable to appreciably endocytose astrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoprotein particles.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Moreover, cells overexpressing LDLR showed a dramatic increase in apoE endocytosis and degradation.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We also found that LDLR knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice had a significant, 50% increase in the level of apoE in the cerebrospinal fluid and extracellular pools of the brain.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, when the PDAPP mouse model of AD was bred onto an Ldlr-/- background, we did not observe a significant change in brain A levels either before or after the onset of A deposition.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Interestingly, human APOE3 or APOE4 (but not APOE2) knock-in mice bred on an Ldlr-/- background had a 210% and 380% increase, respectively, in the level of apoE in cerebrospinal fluid.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results demonstrate that central nervous system levels of both human and murine apoE are directly regulated by LDLR.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although the increase in murine apoE caused by LDLR deficiency was not sufficient to affect A levels or deposition by 10 months of age in PDAPP mice, it remains a possibility that the increase in human apoE3 and apoE4 levels caused by LDLR deficiency will affect this process and could hold promise for therapeutic targets in AD.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Alzheimer disease (AD)1 is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is the most common cause of dementia.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	17	 One of the key pathological hallmarks of AD is the deposition of the 39 to 43-amino acid amyloid (A) peptide in the form of both diffuse (thioflavine-S/Congo red-negative) and fibrillar (thioflavine-S/Congo red-positive) plaques.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An abundance of data suggests that conversion of A from soluble to insoluble forms is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The A peptide is generated from cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the predominant species being A40 and,to a lesser extent, A42 (1).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although accounting for  < 1% of all cases, early-onset, autosomal-dominant forms of AD have been identified that share the common feature of an overall increase in A levels or a relative elevation in the more fibrillogenic A42 throughout life, ultimately resulting in early A deposition and plaque formation.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Identification of these familial AD cases has led to the generation of several APP transgenic mouse models that recapitulate many aspects of A deposition and associated pathology (2).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	22	In 1993, the 4 allele of apoE was found to be a genetic risk factor for the most common form of AD (late-onset AD) as well as for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whereas the 2 allele was shown to be protective (3).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Abundant data suggest that apoE is linked to AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to its ability to act as an A chaperone (4) and influence A metabolism.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	24	 By acting as an A-binding molecule, apoE influences the amount of A deposition and the conformation in which A aggregates, as well as A clearance and toxicity in vivo (5 to 8).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Furthermore, the level of apoE in the brain directly influences all of the aforementioned processes (5 to 8).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For example, APP transgenic mice lacking apoE develop less A deposition and virtually no fibrillar A deposits (5, 9, 10).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, understanding the cellular events and receptors that regulate apoE levels in brain may give important insights into AD pathogenesis.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	28	ApoE is expressed at high levels in the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), where it is present in lipoprotein particles.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, apoE in the CNS is derived from within the CNS and not the plasma (11).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, in the CNS, apoE-containing lipoproteins differ from those found in the periphery in both the amount of sialation and, perhaps more importantly, the type of lipoprotein particle it associates with (12).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In the plasma, apoE is in both very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and a subset of high density lipoproteins that also contain other apoproteins.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In contrast, CNS apoE is in high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins that are secreted primarily by astrocytes and, when released by cells, contain apoE as their sole apolipoprotein constituent (12, 13).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Despite this information, whether specific apoE receptors regulate the level of apoE in the brain or mediate apoE-dependent clearance of apoE-binding proteins is unknown.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Nearly 20 years ago, Brown and Goldstein (14) elucidated the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins in plasma, including apoE.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Subsequently, other members of the LDLR family have been identified.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Many are expressed in brain, and they have been shown in vitro to bind and endocytose lipid-rich lipoproteins that contain apoE (15).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	37	 To determine whether LDLR family members influence the level of CNS apoE and A metabolism, an AD mouse model was recently bred to mice lacking the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) (16).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	38	 An increase in A aggregation and deposition was found in these mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	39	 RAP is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein known to influence the folding and level of all LDLR family members, and in this study, levels of both LDLR-related protein (LRP) and LDLR were examined and found to be reduced in the brain of mice lacking RAP (16).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Additionally, overexpression of a functional LRP mini-receptor in the PDAPP model led to an increase in the levels of soluble A at advanced stages of deposition, but with no detectable change in A deposition measured histologically (17).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, whether other LDLR family members are responsible for brain apoE metabolism and whether they play a role in regulating A levels in vivo remains unclear.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Herein, we investigate the role of LDLR in regulation of CNS-derived apoE as well as on brain A levels in a mouse model of AD.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack endogenous LRP (LRP-null) were used to stably express LDLR, an LRP mini-receptor, apoER2, and the VLDL receptor (19).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Degradation of 125I-labeled apoE3 was measured as radioactivity soluble in 20% trichloroacetic acid in the cell culture supernatant as previously described (19).

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	48	 For apoE endocytosis assays, apoE lipoprotein particles were labeled with the fluorescent hydrocarbon probe DiI as previously described (20).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells or mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking LDLR, LRP, or both receptors were used for the DiI studies (21, 22).

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	96	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   To begin to determine whether one of the two major apoE receptors in the brain, LDLR or LRP, could regulate apoE levels in brain, we purified astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles as described previously (18) and determined their ability to be endocytosed by mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type, Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/-, or double-knock-out Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/- mouse embryos (21).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	97	 DiI-labeled apoE lipoprotein particles were readily taken up into endocytic vesicles in wild-type and Lrp-/- cells (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This punctate pattern of staining is typical of receptor-mediated endocytosis and represents an endosomal/lysosomal distribution of endocytosed ligands.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, cells from Ldlr-/- or double-knock-out Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/- cells showed no appreciable endocytosis of astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	100	 To further clarify the role of other LDLR family members in mediating the receptor-mediated endocytosis of astrocyte-derived apoE, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack endogenous LRP and are stably transfected with the LDLR, LRP mini-receptors, apoER2, and the VLDL receptor to analyze potential uptake and degradation of apoE-containing lipoprotein particles (19).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These cells expressing the different LDLR family members have been shown previously to bind and endocytose control ligands (19).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	102	 These receptors are the main candidate apoE receptors expressed in the brain (15).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Application of 125I-labeled, astrocyte-secreted, apoE-containing lipoprotein particles to cells overexpressing LDLR resulted in a large increase in RAP-inhibitable endocytosis and degradation of apoE (Fig.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	107	 A, DiI-labeled, astrocyte-secreted apoE3-containing lipoprotein particles were readily endocytosed in wild-type and Lrp-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, but not in Ldlr-/- or double-null Ldlr-/-, Lrp-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	108	 B, astrocyte-secreted apoE lipoprotein particles were labeled with 125I and applied to Chinese hamster ovary LRP-null cells overexpressing LDLR family members.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	109	 RAP-inhibitable binding of 125I-labeled apoE3 was calculated and is presented as a percentage of pcDNA3.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Only cells overexpressing the LDLR were able to endocytose and degrade apoE, as evidenced by trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts in the cell culture supernatant (percentage of control; ***, p  <  0.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	112	  To determine the potential role of LDLR in brain apoE metabolism in vivo, we used a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the level of murine apoE in the extracellular space of the brain (such as the CSF) of both wild-type (Ldlr+/+) and LDLR knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Because apoE is secreted into the brain extracellular space, we expected that if a receptor such as LDLR involved in its endocytosis was absent, extracellular levels would be elevated.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	114	 For example, apoE is elevated severalfold in the plasma of Ldlr-/- mice (23) as well as in humans with familial hypercholesterolemia resulting from reduced LDLR expression and/or function (30, 31).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	115	 We found that Ldlr-/- mice had a 53% increase in CSF levels of apoE relative to Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Furthermore, we found that apoE levels in cortical tissue homogenized in PBS (as a reflection of extracellular pools of apoE) were significantly increased by 57% in Ldlr-/- mice compared with Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Together, both the in vitro and in vivo data suggest that the LDLR plays an important role as an apoE receptor that mediates the uptake, degradation, and level of apoE in the brain.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	128	  Because Ldlr-/- mice have elevated extracellular levels of apoE in the brain and because apoE acts as an A chaperone for both soluble and insoluble A, we wanted to determine the effect of LDLR on the deposition of A in vivo.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	129	 To determine whether LDLR has a direct effect on A aggregation and deposition in vivo, we used the PDAPP mouse model of AD to generate PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-, Ldlr-/- mice (littermates).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	130	 PDAPP mice express the human APP transgene containing a familial AD mutation at amino acid 717 and overproduce A (particularly A42).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In the hippocampus of these mice, the amount of soluble and insoluble A increases in an age-dependent manner beginning between 6 and 9 months of age, when plaques begin to deposit (25, 32).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	132	 We first examined the levels of both A40 and A42 in young PDAPP+/-, Ldlr+/+ and PDAPP+/-, Ldlr-/- mice at 3 months of age, well before the deposition of A begins.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	133	 PBS-soluble levels of A40 and A42 in the hippocampus were not significantly different between the two genotypes (Fig.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The area of the hippocampus covered by A immunoreactive deposits in tissue sections was 31% higher in 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	137	 4A), but this increase was not statistically significant.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Similar results were found for thioflavine-S-positive fibrillar deposits, and comparable results were found in the cortex (data not shown).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	139	 A biochemical analysis of carbonate-soluble A levels in the hippocampus revealed slight but nonsignificant increases in both A40 (17%) and A42 (53%) of 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Carbonate-insoluble A levels in the hippocampus also revealed slight but nonsignificant increases in both A40 (51%) and A42 (10%) of 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- mice as compared with PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice (Fig.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	142	 5A), there were no differences in either brain or CSF cholesterol (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	143	 There was also no evidence that the processing of APP (Fig.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	144	 5D) or the levels of total APP protein (data not shown) were different between the genotypes.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Thus, although the level of murine apoE is elevated by about 50% in the extracellular CNS pools in Ldlr-/- mice, these data suggest that this degree of change in the level of apoE is not sufficiently increased to significantly affect A levels at young ages or the early stages of A deposition in PDAPP transgenic mice.

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	158	 To confirm previous findings noted from these mice (33), we assessed plasma cholesterol and apoE and found that both were significantly elevated in the absence of LDLR in all genotypes (data not shown).

0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, when the PDAPP mouse model of AD was bred onto an Ldlr-/- background, there was not a significant increase in the levels of A40 and A42 at young ages before deposition of A begins.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Additionally, there was not a significant increase in A deposition defined by immunohistochemical and biochemical measures between 10-month-old PDAPP, Ldlr-/- and PDAPP, Ldlr+/+ mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Interestingly, using human APOE knock-in mice, we found that the increase in the level of apoE3 and apoE4 (but not apoE2) on an Ldlr-/- background was much greater than that for murine apoE on this same Ldlr-/- background.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	203	Our in vitro data indicate that LDLR family members including LRP, VLDL receptor, and apoER2 are not able to appreciably internalize and degrade astrocyte-secreted apoE-containing lipoproteins.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Previous work has clearly demonstrated that these LDLR family members are able to efficiently bind and endocytose apoE reconstituted in large, cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particles termed -VLDL (35).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	205	 However, these -VLDL particles differ from astrocyte-secreted apoE in lipid composition, the presence of other apoproteins, and the amount of sialation (12).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The apolipoprotein lipidation state does alter receptor binding characteristics.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	207	 For example, our previous studies have shown that recombinant apoE in the absence of lipid prefers binding to LRP over the LDLR (22).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This is not a form of apoE that has been shown to be present under physiological conditions.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Together, these results indicate that the lipid content and form of apoE lipoprotein particles can alter their receptor binding specificity.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	210	 They also demonstrate that the LDLR is an important apoE receptor that regulates human and murine apoE endocytosis and levels in the brain.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Although the results of this study do not rule out that other LDLR family members contribute in some way to the level of apoE in the brain, they clearly show that LDLR plays an important role in brain apoE metabolism.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	212	Recent studies have shown that increasing or decreasing cellular cholesterol can influence cellular A secretion (36).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Although Ldlr-/- mice have elevated plasma cholesterol levels, we found that the level of brain cholesterol is unaffected in these mice as has been previously reported (37).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The exact mechanism by which apoE affects AD pathogenesis is unclear.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, a large body of evidence suggests that one mechanism by which it influences the age of onset of AD is by acting as a chaperone for both soluble and insoluble A, thereby influencing A clearance and fibrillogenesis (3, 5, 7, 32).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Our current results suggest that although the LDLR regulates extracellular levels of apoE in the brain, a 50% increase in the level of murine apoE over endogenous levels is not sufficient to alter A levels at young ages or the early stages of A deposition in PDAPP mice at 10 months of age.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	217	 This may represent a ceiling effect of the level of murine apoE or indicate that a larger increase in the level of murine apoE may be necessary to effect a change in A levels in this model.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Alternatively, other pathways of apoE-mediated clearance of A play a much larger role in the metabolism of A such as LRP or bulk flow along interstitial fluid drainage pathways.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Unfortunately, Lrp-/- mice die in early embryonic stages, and thus the effect of endogenous LRP on brain apoE levels is difficult to assess as shown in this study.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Additionally, the LDLR may play a role in A deposition only at later stages of deposition, as was found for LRP in PDAPP mice (17).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	221	 It is also possible that the LDLR may differentially regulate human apoE isoforms in the CNS to a greater extent than murine apoE and therefore influence A levels and deposition.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It is interesting that independent of the effect of the LDLR, the level of apoE in the CSF of human APOE2 mice is significantly higher than that in APOE3 or APOE4 mice.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This suggests that in humans, LDLR may play a more important role in regulating CNS apoE levels and AD pathogenesis.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Studies of human CSF have reported no significant differences in the level of human apoE between individuals expressing APOE3 or APOE4 alleles, but the level of CSF apoE in APOE2/2 homozygous individuals has not been assessed, to our knowledge.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Given that APOE2 has been associated with a decreased risk for developing AD, an intriguing possibility is that the absolute level of apoE present in the brain of these individuals could account for the decrease in risk.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Human and murine apoE differ by 25% at the amino acid level, and human apoE isoforms and murine apoE isolated from VLDL have been shown to differentially bind the LDLR (33).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Using the PDAPP mouse model, previous studies from our group have shown that expression of human apoE isoforms under the control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter results in a significant delay in deposition compared with mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (7, 32).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	228	 More recently, the same human apoE knock-in mice used in this study were crossed to PDAPP mice, and both a delay in A deposition and an isoform-dependent effect on A deposition (E4  >  E3 E2) were found (38).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Additionally, we have recently replicated this result in the APPsw mouse model of AD utilizing the same APOE3 and APOE4 knock-in mice used in this study (39).
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Clearly, human apoE isoforms affect A metabolism and deposition differently than murine apoE, but whether this is due to altered clearance and/or structure of A in vivo remains to be determined.
0.36174858.15888448.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Determining the role of LDLR or other receptors or clearance pathways in the brain that are also involved in regulating apoE levels is central to understanding how apoE influences A metabolism and AD pathogenesis.

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is an ATP-binding cassette protein that transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in very low plasma apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Herein, we have used Abca1-/- mice to ask whether ABCA1 is involved in lipidation of HDL in the central nervous system (CNS).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	9	 ApoE is the most abundant CNS apolipoprotein and is present in HDL-like lipoproteins in CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in both the cortex (80% reduction) and the CSF (98% reduction).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	11	 CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol as well as small apoE-containing lipoproteins, suggesting abnormal lipidation of apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Astrocytes, the primary producer of CNS apoE, were cultured from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, and nascent lipoprotein particles were collected.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Abca1-/- astrocytes secreted lipoprotein particles that had markedly decreased cholesterol and apoE and had smaller apoE-containing particles than particles from Abca1+/+ astrocytes.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These findings demonstrate that ABCA1 plays a critical role in CNS apoE metabolism.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Since apoE isoforms and levels strongly influence Alzheimer's disease pathology and risk, these data suggest that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is the founding member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 family of transporters, which is the largest group of transmembrane transporters with 48 known family members in humans (1).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	17	 All ABC transporters share homology in their ATP-binding domain and use ATP to translocate a wide variety of substrates across extra- and intracellular membranes (2).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Defects in ABC transporters cause at least 14 known genetic diseases (3).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	19	ABCA1 transports cellular cholesterol and phospholipids from cells onto high density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma (4, 5).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In humans, loss-of-function mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier's disease (6 to 9), which is characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lymphatic tissues and increased catabolism of abnormally lipidated HDL, resulting in very low levels of plasma HDL and HDL-associated apolipoproteins A-I (apoA-I) and A-II (apoA-II) (10, 11).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	21	 ABCA1 knock-out mice (Abca1-/-) have been produced, and the mice have a similar phenotype as patients with Tangier's disease (12).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	22	However, neither Tangier's disease patients nor Abca1-/- mice have been examined to determine whether ABCA1 plays a role in lipidation or metabolism of lipoproteins in the central nervous system (CNS).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The most abundant apolipoprotein in the CNS is apolipoprotein E (apoE), which is produced within the CNS, primarily by astrocytes and to some extent microglia (13 to 17).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	24	 ApoE is present in brain tissue and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it is present in HDL-like particles (18 to 20).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	25	 By analyzing brain tissue, CSF, plasma, and primary astrocyte cultures from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice, we determined that deletion of ABCA1 markedly affects metabolism of apoE and cholesterol in the CNS and in nascent lipoprotein particles secreted by cultured astrocytes.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These findings have implications for neurological diseases involving apoE, such as Alzheimer's disease.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	27	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Animals and Tissue Preparation Mice heterozygous for the Abca1-null allele on a DBA background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME (strain name: DBA/1-Abca1tm1Jdm).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These mice have similar abnormalities to those found in humans with Tangier's disease, such as greatly reduced plasma HDL (12).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The heterozygous mice were bred to one another to generate littermates with all Abca1 genotypes: wild type (Abca1+/+), heterozygous (Abca1+/-), and knock-out (Abca1-/-).

0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We found that Abca1-/- mice have greatly decreased apoE levels in the plasma (96% reduction), CSF (98% reduction), and cortex (80% reduction) as compared with Abca1+/+ mice.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The decreased apoE levels in plasma and brain that we observed are similar to those seen by others.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	170	2 The decreased apoE levels in the CNS are not related to Apoe gene expression but likely result from increased catabolism of abnormally lipidated apoE-containing HDL lipoproteins produced in the CNS, as occurs with abnormally lipidated apoA-I and apoA-II that are secreted by the liver and are rapidly catabolized in the plasma of Tangier's disease patients (10, 11).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	171	Although the alterations in CNS apoE levels were profound, differences in total CNS lipids were more subtle and present only in CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Brain tissue from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice had no differences in free cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, and phospholipids and showed no evidence of lipid deposition by histological staining.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	173	 These results suggest that ABCA1 does not play a major role in regulating global cellular lipid levels in brain tissue in vivo and that this regulation is performed by additional molecules.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, CSF from Abca1-/- mice had significantly reduced cholesterol, showing that ABCA1 is important in regulating extracellular lipid levels in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	175	Conditioned media collected from primary cultures of astrocytes derived from Abca1+/+, +/-, and -/- mice showed that although total levels of apoE secreted by astrocytes are not affected by Abca1 genotype, secretion of cholesterol into the media is markedly reduced in Abca1-/- cultures, which is consistent with ABCA1 having a role in transporting astrocyte-derived cellular cholesterol onto lipoproteins.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This function may occur in the astrocyte secretory pathway or extracellularly.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Analysis of nascent lipoprotein particles isolated from conditioned media of primary astrocyte cultures demonstrated that Abca1-/- astrocytes secrete apoE-containing particles of markedly smaller size with reduced cholesterol and apoE, demonstrating that ABCA1 is required by the main cellular producer of apoE in the CNS to normally lipidate apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Of the apoE produced by CNS cells such as astrocytes that reach the CSF of Abca1-/- mice, a fraction of the particles present were also abnormally small, although some were of normal size.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Thus, there appears to be a mechanism that does not require ABCA1 to lipidate some apoE that reaches the CSF.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, the fact that CSF apoE levels in Abca1-/- were 2% of normal suggests that the non-ABCA1 mediated pathway is inefficient and that most apoE particles produced in the absence of ABCA1-mediated lipidation are rapidly metabolized in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	181	ApoE and apoJ are the two major apoproteins produced by astrocytes, and each is secreted into unique apoE- or apoJ-only containing particles (33).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	182	 ApoE secreted by astrocytes is present in particles that contain approximately an equal mass of apoE, cholesterol, and phospholipids (21).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Furthermore, virtually all cholesterol and phospholipids secreted by astrocytes are associated with apoE (33).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In contrast, apoJ secreted by astrocytes has very little associated cholesterol or phospholipids (21) and we found that it was present at normal levels in the brains of Abca1-/- mice.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus, apoJ particles are stable in the absence of ABCA1, possibly because they are normally lipid-poor and do not require extensive lipidation for stability.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	186	These data demonstrate that complete loss of ABCA1 profoundly affects apoE levels in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Additionally, since Abca1+/- mice had intermediate apoE levels, more subtle alterations in ABCA1 gene dosage and/or functionality may affect apoE metabolism.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The Apoe genotype is a major risk factor for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (34 to 36).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The Apoe genotype may also influence neurologic prognosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (37), traumatic brain injury (38), and multiple sclerosis (39).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The effects of apoE on AD and CAA are likely to be mediated in large part by the role of apoE role as an amyloid- (A) chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis (40).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice that develop many of the pathological changes seen in AD and CAA, the level of apoE, regardless of species or genotype, markedly influences the time of onset, conformation, and amount of the A peptide that accumulates in the brain with age (41 to 45).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	192	 For example, when amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice were crossed to Apoe-/- mice, animals lacking apoE had almost no fibrillar A deposition, neuritic plaques, or CAA, and Apoe+/- mice had less than 50% as much A-related pathology as Apoe+/+ mice (41 to 44).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These results show that alterations in CNS apoE levels by as little as 50% have massive effects on AD-like pathology in the CNS.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Since ABCA1 regulates both the level of apoE as well as its state of lipidation, modulation of ABCA1 levels or function is likely to directly influence apoE/A interactions along with A deposition and its negative consequences in the brain.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In addition to the effects of ABCA1 on apoE, recent studies also suggest that ABCA1 can influence cellular A production (46 to 48).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These effects are likely independent of apoE since alterations in ABCA1 expression levels affect A in some cell types that do not express apoE.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Several studies also suggest a direct link between Abca1 polymorphisms and risk for AD (32, 49, 50).
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	198	In summary, we have shown that ABCA1 is required for normal CNS apoE levels in vivo as well as production of normally lipidated apoE-containing lipoproteins by astrocytes.
0.36494276.15269217.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Since apoE levels in the CNS profoundly influence AD and CAA pathology in vivo, modulation of ABCA1 function and levels may be a novel therapeutic target for AD, CAA, and other diseases of the CNS.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	3	Apolipoprotein E (apoE), particularly the e4 allele, is genetically linked to the incidence of Alzheimer's disease.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In vitro, apoE has been shown to bind -amyloid (A), an amyloidogenic peptide that aggregates to form the primary component of senile plaques.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to A with greater avidity than apoE4 (LaDu, M.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This is in contrast to data using purified apoE isoforms as substrate for A (Strittmatter, W.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that the preferential binding of A to apoE3 is attenuated and even abolished with purification, a process that includes delipidation and denaturation.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE isoforms from both tissue culture medium and intact human very low density lipoproteins with that of apoE purified from these two sources.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The interaction of human A- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) -peptide and apoE was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western immunoblotting for either A or apoE immunoreactivity.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	10	 While the level of the apoE3A complex was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex in unpurified conditioned medium, apoE3 and apoE4 purified from this medium bound to A with comparable avidity.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Moreover, using endogenous apoE on very low density lipoproteins from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes, apoE3 was again a better substrate for A than apoE4.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apoE purified from these plasma lipoproteins exhibited little isoform specificity in binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results suggest that native preparations of apoE may be a more physiologically relevant substrate for A binding than purified apoE and further underscore the importance of subtle differences in apoE conformation to its biological activity.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	14	Apolipoprotein E (apoE),() a component of several classes of lipoproteins, acts as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, thus regulating lipid transport and clearance.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	15	 ApoE is also expressed in the brain (1) and in response to injury in both the peripheral (2) and central nervous (3) systems.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In humans, apoE has three major isoforms, E2 (Cys, Cys), E3 (Cys, Arg), and E4 (Arg, Arg), which are products of three alleles at a single gene locus.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The presence of cysteine in apoE2 and apoE3 allow these isoforms to form disulfide-linked dimers.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recently, it has been demonstrated that the apoE e4 allele is present with increased frequency in patients with sporadic (4) and late-onset familial (5) Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Due primarily to this genetic linkage, the role of apoE in the pathogenesis of AD is being actively pursued.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	20	A major neuropathological feature of AD is the presence of extracellular senile plaques composed predominantly of aggregated -amyloid peptide (A).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The physiological mechanism by which apoE contributes to AD pathology may be by means of an isoform-specific interaction with A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	22	 ApoE and A colocalize in senile plaques (6) , and synthetic A peptides bind in vitro to apoE from tissue culture medium (7) and cerebrospinal fluid (5, 8, 9) as well as to purified apoE (9, 10) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, studies involving apoE isoform specificity in binding to A have been limited and contradictory.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In previous work, we demonstrated that apoE3 from tissue culture medium binds to A with greater avidity than apoE4 (7) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This is in contrast to data from Strittmatter et al.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	63	 These results are in contrast to data published by Strittmatter et al.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Using apoE purified from human plasma, they reported that apoE4 binds A more rapidly than apoE3.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	65	 However, the level of A binding to apoE3 and apoE4 after several hours of incubation was comparable.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The major differences between these two studies are the source of apoE (plasma versus secreted by cultured cells) and whether the apoE protein was purified prior to use in the binding assays.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In this study, we examined whether these differences could account for the discrepancy between these two reports regarding apoE isoform-specific binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	68	 We compared the A binding capacity of unpurified apoE from both conditioned medium and intact human VLDL from plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes with the A binding capacity of apoE purified from these two sources.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The purification procedure (13) used was the same as that used by Strittmatter et al.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	70	We first examined the effect of purification of apoE from conditioned medium on the formation of apoEA complexes.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	71	 ApoE3 and apoE4 were purified from the medium of transfected HEK-293 cells, and the binding of this material to A was compared with the binding of unpurified apoE from medium (Fig.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Prior to purification, the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	73	 1, A and B, lane 2) was 20-fold greater compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These results are consistent with our previous data that demonstrated that this preferential binding of A to apoE3 is maintained over time, pH range, and concentration of apoE and A (7) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Purification of the apoE isoforms from this medium resulted in a decrease in A binding to apoE3 (Fig.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	76	 1, A and B, lane 6) and an increase in A binding to apoE4 ( lane 8).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	77	 To determine whether an auxiliary component that influences the isoform specificity of apoE binding to A is present in the medium of HEK-293 cells, we reconstituted purified apoE with mock-transfected conditioned medium.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The isoform specificity of apoE binding to A was not restored to pre-purification levels, indicating that purification does not remove a component present in the medium that confers the preferential binding of A to apoE3 (compare Figs.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Sources of apoE were as follows: conditioned medium of transfected cells (apoE3, lanes 1 and 2; apoE4, lanes 3 and 4) and purified from conditioned medium (apoE3, lanes 5 and 6; apoE4, lanes 7 and 8).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Samples were run in nonreducing Laemmli buffer on 10-20% SDS-Tricine gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and probed with 4G8 antibody ( A) or apoE antiserum ( B).
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	83	To examine the binding of A to unpurified plasma apoE isoforms, VLDL was isolated from the plasma of apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 homozygotes and used for binding reactions with A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Similar to the results using unpurified apoE from conditioned medium, we observed an 20-fold difference in the amount of the apoE3A complex (Fig.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	85	 3, A and B, lane 2) compared with the apoE4A complex ( lane 4) when using intact VLDL particles as the source of apoE.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	86	 As with purification of apoE from medium, purification of apoE from the VLDL fraction of human plasma attenuated the preferential binding of apoE3 to A (Fig.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The level of A binding to both apoE4 and apoE3 dimer was increased after purification of apoE from plasma.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In apoE3/3 plasma, the apoE immunoreactive species migrating slightly higher than the apoEA complex (55 kDa) is the apoE3-apolipoprotein A-II heterodimer (Fig.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	91	 While some variation in the purification-mediated loss of preferential apoE3 binding to A was observed, in general, purification of apoE from both medium and plasma abolished isoform-specific binding to A.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Sources of apoE were as follows: intact VLDL from apoE3/3 ( lanes 1 and 2) and apoE4/4 ( lanes 3 and 4) homozygotes and purified from VLDL of apoE3/3 ( lanes 5 and 6) and apoE4/4 ( lanes 7 and 8) homozygotes.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Samples were run as described in the legend to Fig.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	97	 For apoE3 VLDL, total protein was 95 ng/ microl, and triglyceride was 600 ng/ microl.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	98	 For apoE4 VLDL, total protein was 110 ng/ microl, and triglyceride was 400 ng/ microl.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	99	 (10) used apoE purified from plasma to show that A binds to apoE4 monomer at a faster rate than to apoE3 monomer.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	100	 However, the contribution of the apoE3-A complex in their time course data is difficult to discern since the blots were probed for apoE and A immunoreactivity simultaneously (10) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Therefore, we repeated the time course study using purified plasma apoE isoforms and probed for A (Fig.

0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Similar to the results obtained by Strittmatter et al.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	104	 (10) , apoE4 monomer did form a complex with A at a faster rate compared with apoE3 monomer.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, when the apoE3 dimer-A complex was taken into account, the total binding of A to apoE3 and apoE4 remained comparable across time.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	106	There are several possibilities that could account for the loss of isoform specificity in the binding of purified apoE to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Purification may result in a change in the oxidative state of apoE that influences its binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Although the apoE isoforms are subject to the same conditions while undergoing purification, oxidation could be specific to the Cysin apoE3.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This could affect conformation-dependent binding of apoE to A, either directly or via interaction of other amino acids with this residue.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, apoE3 dimer, particularly in its purified form, readily binds A, indicating that at least oxidation of cysteine does not seem to adversely affect apoE3 A complex formation.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In addition, oxidation provides no obvious explanation for the increase in A binding to purified apoE4 monomer.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	112	Another more likely explanation is that apoE acquires a conformation when lipid-associated that confers isoform-specific binding to A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Purification, which includes delipidation, may increase the binding of A to apoE3 dimer and apoE4 monomer by disrupting the endogenous conformation of these apoE species.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In each of the unpurified preparations used here, apoE was lipid-associated.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	115	 ApoE from human plasma was in the VLDL fraction, while the majority of apoE in conditioned medium was in a high density lipid fraction.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	116	() Purified apoE has been shown to require lipid to restore its biological activity in other assay systems, presumably by allowing the denatured protein to refold to its functional conformation.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	117	 These apoE activity assays include such diverse functions as receptor binding and modulation of neuritic growth.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	118	 While purified apoE is unable to displace I-labeled low density lipoprotein (LDL) from LDL receptors (16) , high affinity binding is restored when apoE is added in the presence of a variety of lipid particles, including phospholipid vesicles (17) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Similarly, the binding of purified apoE to LDL receptor-related protein is enhanced by the addition of -migrating VLDL (18) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In primary dorsal root ganglia cultures, purified apoE3 and apoE4 have no effect on neuritic growth.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	121	 However, when added in the presence of -migrating VLDL, both apoE isoforms affect neuritic growth, with apoE3 increasing neuritic extension and decreasing branching and apoE4 decreasing both branching and extension (19) .
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Experiments are in progress using the assay system described here to determine the nature of the interaction of A with lipid-associated apoE using both endogenous lipoproteins and reconstituted lipid vesicles.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	123	The data presented here are consistent with a function for apoE in the pathogenesis of AD by sequestering A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Avid binding of apoE3 to soluble A in the neuropil could lead to enhanced clearance or altered fibril formation, both of which could prevent the conversion of A into a neurotoxic species.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Since lipid-associated apoE3 and apoE4 bind the LDL receptor and LDL receptor-related protein with equal affinity (18) , efficient uptake and clearance of A may depend on its preferential binding to apoE3.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Alternatively, purified apoE3 and apoE4 are known to differ with respect to their effect on A fibril formation (20, 21, 22) , suggesting that native apoE may play an even greater isoform-specific role in the extracellular aggregation of A due to differences in A binding characteristics.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Finally, there is evidence that A-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons is attenuated by the addition of rabbit apoE (23) , leading to the intriguing possibility that human apoE may contribute to A-induced toxicity in an isoform-specific manner.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	128	In summary, using unpurified apoE from tissue culture medium and intact VLDL particles, the apoE3A complex was 20-fold more abundant than the apoE4A complex.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This isoform specificity was attenuated or abolished when apoE purified from these two sources was used in binding reactions with A.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	130	 ApoE is an apolipoprotein, and as such, its endogenous conformation requires lipid.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	131	 It is therefore not surprising that the type of apoE preparation used can affect the results.
0.29569125.7721816.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The avidity of A binding to apoE3 compared with apoE4 demonstrated here may be involved in the isoform-specific effect underlying the genetic correlation between the apoE e4 allele and AD.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received June 1, 1998 Revised and Accepted July 8, 1998.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	4	Possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is the most frequently associated genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Recently, new polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the APOE gene have been described.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We analysed the effects of three of these mutations (-491 AT, -427 CT and Th1/E47cs) on disease risk in a large case-control study, and tested their impacts on APOE allelic expression in brain tissues.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The Th1/E47cs T allele was associated with an increased risk of occurrence of AD, while the -491 T allele was associated with a decreased risk, independently of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphism effect.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, the impact of the Th1/E47cs mutation was the strongest.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The -427 CT polymorphism was not associated with the disease.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In AD subjects heterozygous for the [epsis]4 allele, analysis of allelic expression showed that the relative expression levels of the [epsis]4 allele were higher than those of the corresponding controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Consistent with epidemiological data, the relative level of expression of the [epsis]4 allele was modified accordingly to the presence or absence of the two main promoter polymorphisms, indicating, in vivo, the deleterious effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele and the protective effect of the -491 T allele in population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These data indicate that in addition to the qualitative effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 polymorphisms on the AD occurrence, the quantitative variation of expression of these alleles due to functional APOE promoter mutations, is a key determinant of AD development.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	13	The presence of at least one apolipoprotein E (APOE) [epsis]4 allele is a major genetic susceptibility factor for late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This risk factor accounts for ~45-60% of cases (1).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Indeed, the [epsis]4 allele is associated with an increased risk of AD in an allele dose dependant manner (2,3).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Conversely, the [epsis]2 allele protects against the disease (4,5).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The mechanisms by which apoE isoforms are implicated in human nervous system physiology and influence the pathogenesis of AD, are not fully understood (2,6-8).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The effect of the APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles may not be due only to the intrinsic biochemical properties of the isoforms coded by these alleles.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other genetic variants influencing APOE allele expression may account for the increase or decrease in the level of risk of AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This hypothesis is supported firstly by preliminary observations of the relative overexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in the brain of patients with AD, compared with controls (9).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Secondly, Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms located in the APOE promoter have been described and associated with AD risk (10,11).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover the effect of these two polymorphisms on AD occurrence was described separately in case-control studies.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This prompted us to analyse the relative contribution of these two promoter polymorphisms, and also a third, located at position -427 of the APOE promoter together with the [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 alleles, towards AD risk in a large case-control study (509 controls and 573 AD cases).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, we investigated the possible influences of the two main polymorphisms on APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 allelic relative expression in brain tissues, to approach their in vivo functionality, in brain samples from 49 AD cases and 45 controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	25	As expected, possession of the [epsis]4 allele was strongly associated with AD [odds ratio (OR) = 5.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	26	40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	27	0001], while the presence of the [epsis]2 allele exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The frequency of the Th1/E47cs T allele was increased in AD cases compared with controls ([chi]2 = 23.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The risk of developing AD for carriers of at least one T allele was 2.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Conversely, the frequency of the -491 T allele was decreased in patients, compared with controls ([chi]2 = 9.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The genotype and allele frequencies of the -491 AT polymorphism were both similar to those observed in the North American population but differed from the Spanish sample (11).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The OR to develop AD in subjects bearing at least one -491 T allele was 0.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	33	 No association with the disease was detected for the -427 CT polymorphism.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To eliminate possible confounding effects of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the association of the Th1/E47cs and -491 AT polymorphisms with AD, we controlled the effects of each allele using logistic regression adjusted for the presence or absence of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	35	 After adjustment, the risk associated with possession of at least one Th1/E47cs T allele persisted (OR = 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	36	004), while the risk associated with -491 T allele did not (OR = 0.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This observation suggested that the effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele is independent of that of the [epsis]4 allele, while the -491 T allele is not.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, since the Th1/E47cs G and [epsis]2 alleles are in complete disequilibrium (Table 2), we also performed a logistic regression including both protective and deleterious effects of [epsis]2 and [epsis]4 alleles, respectively.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The risk associated with the Th1/E47cs T allele still persisted (OR = 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	40	If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased or decreased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has two major implications: (i) promoter mutations may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increase or decrease of the deleterious or protective risk associated with the [epsis]4 or [epsis]2 allele, respectively; and (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of APOE, as suggested by preliminary data (12), the promoter mutations will have differential effects detectable mainly in APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 heterozygous individuals.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To verify these assumptions, we studied the OR of developing AD for APOE heterozygous and homozygous individuals, using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and the presence of at least one -491 T and one Th1/E47 T allele.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 homozygotes, no effect was found (OR = 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	43	44, for Th1/E47 T and -491 T alleles, respectively).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Conversely, in APOE [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 heterozygotes, individuals bearing at least one Th1/E47 T allele had an increased risk of developing AD (OR = 3.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	45	0001), while individuals bearing at least one -491 T allele exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	57	The location of both polymorphisms within the regulatory region of the APOE gene, and their potential effect in vitro reported in hepatoma cells, suggested that these polymorphisms may play a role in the control of APOE expression levels in brain.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In order to test this hypothesis, we obtained 94 AD or control brain tissues heterozygous for the APOE and measured the percentage of the expression level of the three APOE alleles.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In controls, the [epsis]4 allele was strongly underexpressed compared with the [epsis]3 or the [epsis]2 allele in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 brain samples, respectively, while the [epsis]2 and [epsis]3 expressions were almost similar in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 samples (Fig.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	60	 As suggested by preliminary data (9), there was a clear and consistent increase in the relative [epsis]4 allelic expression between [epsis]3[epsis]4 patients and [epsis]3[epsis]4 controls (34.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	61	 A significant decrease in the relative [epsis]2 expression was demonstrated in [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD brains compared with [epsis]2[epsis]3 controls (32.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	68	The previous epidemiological data suggest that the -491 AT polymorphism and the Th1/E47cs polymorphism may be good candidates to mediate these allelic distortions.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In particular, estimation of the OR associated with the combination of the [epsis]4 and the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome indicate an estimated increased risk of 1.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	70	7 for the heterozygous [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals presenting this haplotype, as described previously (10).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Thus, if the [epsis]4 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs T allele on the same chromosome, while the [epsis]3 allele is associated with the Th1/E47cs G allele on the other, the relative [epsis]4/[epsis]3 mRNA ratio should be significantly increased and associated with AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Conversely, if both [epsis]4 and [epsis]3 alleles are under the control of the same Th1/E47cs allele, either G or T, the level of expression should be similar.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, we expected a stronger distortion in Th1/E47cs heterozygotes than in homozygotes.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This argument is clearly illustrated by our experimental data (Table 3).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The same approach is valid for the -491 AT mutation.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	76	The influence of both polymorphisms on relative mRNA expression level could be observed only in cases (Fig.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Affected patients carrying the Th1/E47cs GT or the -491 AT genotypes had the highest and lowest relative levels of expression of [epsis]4 expression, respectively (Fig.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	82	The deleterious effect of the Th1/E47cs T allele and the protective effect of the -491 T allele described recently (10,11) were confirmed by this large case-control study.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	83	 These effects were obvious in the APOE heterozygous population, but not in the homozygous population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These data are not surprising for two reasons: (i) we would expect that APOE [epsis]4 homozygotes with high expressing promoter alleles on both chromosomes, had a higher risk of developing AD than [epsis]4 homozygotes with low expressing promoter alleles.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, the small size of the [epsis]4/[epsis]4 control population did not allow such an impact to be brought forward; (ii) as a consequence, the measured OR in [epsis]2/[epsis]3/[epsis]4 homozygous individuals mainly depended on the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	86	 No effect was found in the latter population whatever the studied promoter polymorphism.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Furthermore, the apoE3 isoform is considered as the isoform having the lesser effect on AD pathology.

0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	89	We did not confirm the deleterious effect of the -491 AA genotype described in the [epsis]3[epsis]3 Spanish population (11).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This discrepancy may be explained by the significant difference in the -491 AT genotype distribution observed between the Spanish and the French or American control populations.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Since the AD genotypic frequency was similar in the three studied populations, the deleterious effect of the AA genotype in the [epsis]3[epsis]3 group may only be due to the distribution in the Spanish control population.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	92	When the impacts of these two promoter polymorphisms and the APOE [epsis]4 allele were studied simultaneously in a multiple logistic regression model, we demonstrated that only the Th1/E47cs T allele modified the risk of developing AD independently of the [epsis]4 allele, suggesting that the -491 polymorphisms may play a weaker role compared with Th1/E47cs in the development of AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The location of both polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the APOE gene, their effects on the transcriptional activity in hepatoma cells (12) and their impacts in AD population, prompted us to test the hypothesis that they may modulate the APOE expression levels in brain and, therefore, be partly responsible for the marked allelic distortion of the APOE mRNA we observed in AD brain compared with controls in all the heterozygous genotypes.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Indeed, the [epsis]4 allele was overexpressed in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 AD cases and the [epsis]2 allele underexpressed in [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases compared with their respective controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Consistent with the effects deduced from the case-control study, the [epsis]4 allele expression in AD brain was also correlated with the polymorphisms of the regulatory region of the APOE (Fig.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	96	 2): the Th1/E47cs T allele may increase the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele in AD, while the -491 T allele may decrease it.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	97	Because numerous studies reported contradictory findings in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concerning apoE protein level, it is difficult to speculate on the link between APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels (13-17).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	98	 However, as suggested by Yamada et al.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	99	, the APOE expression may be decreased by an [epsis]4 gene dosage in AD: the [epsis]3 homozygous AD cases expressed more APOE mRNA than the [epsis]4[epsis]4 AD cases, the [epsis]3[epsis]4 presenting an intermediate mRNA level (18).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	100	 A similar trend was found for proteins in AD brains (14) or in plasma (J.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Poirier, personal communication), indicating that both the protein and mRNA levels may be directly correlated during the disease.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Underlining the importance of apoE level, the APOE expression has been shown to correlate with A[beta] peptide deposition in transgenic mice (19,20).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	103	This observation may be very important, since previous reports showed that the APOE gene expression was increased between 2- and 3-fold in AD brains compared with controls regardless of the APOE genotype (18,21).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases, both the [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 alleles would be overexpressed, but the [epsis]4 allele, due to the promoter mutations, being still more overexpressed than the [epsis]3 allele.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Exacerbation of APOE [epsis]4 expression level may foster the intrinsic deleterious effect of the apoE4 isoform in AD for instance in promoting A[beta] aggregation (2,6,22).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	106	This expression level modulation may be intended not only for neurodegenerative disease, but also for neural development.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Indeed, we observed a strong underexpression of the [epsis]4 allele compared with the [epsis]3 allele in controls.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Although the role of apoE during maturation and ageing is not completely understood yet, the fact that apoE deficient homozygous mice exhibit reversible dendritic alterations and significant learning deficits in the Morris water maze, suggests neurotrophic capabilities for apoE (23-25).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	109	 However, the abilities of each isoform may be different since the apoE4 isoform does not have the same effects as the apoE3 isoform on neurite outgrowth (26).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For instance, apoE3, but not apoE4, may stabilize the neuronal cytoskeleton (7).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	111	A global assessment of the modulation of APOE expression is difficult.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Indeed, to date, five polymorphisms have been described in the APOE promoter region (10,12).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Two of the three polymorphisms studied, seem to play a role in AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The two remaining have allelic frequencies  < 1% (12), and therefore cannot explain the effects observed in the case-control and mRNA studies.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However, it remains possible that other unknown polymorphisms modulate the APOE mRNA level.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	116	 These new mutations may be far away from the promoter polymorphisms, for instance in the brain tissue specific element (27,28).
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The interaction between all the putative polymorphisms modifying APOE expression will be very difficult to model.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Various combinations of different mutations may confer a large APOE expression heterogeneity at two levels: (i) the absolute level of APOE expression and (ii) the percentage of expression of one allele compared with the other in heterozygous individuals, adding to the complexity of the association between APOE and AD.
0.3697104.9700208.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Therefore, the variation of the APOE expression induced by the APOE promoter polymorphisms may partly explain the heterogeneity of the impact of the [epsis]4 allele in different ethnic groups (1,29).

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The authors performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (16 comparisons) with CTSD genotyping (3,174 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,298 controls).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Overall, the random effects odds ratio for the T versus the C allele was 1.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There was significant between-study heterogeneity but no evidence of a significant association when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (odds ratio (OR) = 1.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The summary odds ratio for T carriers versus T noncarriers was similar in subjects carrying or not carrying an apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4 carriage tended to be more prominent in the presence of the T allele (random effects OR = 6.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The meta-analysis shows that the CTSD polymorphism is not a major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, although a small effect or an enhancement of the APOE*4 effect cannot be excluded.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The cathepsin D gene (CTSD) is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The synthesis of beta-amyloid peptide is a putative key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Beta-amyloid derives from its precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by secretases.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Therefore, it has been postulated that variants in the genes coding for enzymes involved in the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or in the degradation and clearance of beta-amyloid from the central nervous system may be potential risk factors for Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	23	   GENE VARIANTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   The CTSD gene contains a polymorphic C-to-T transition site at position 224 in exon 2.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This polymorphism results in an Ala38-to-Val substitution in the cathepsin D profragment (3).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The polymorphism has been associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of the cathep-sin D profragment in one study (3).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, the T allele has been associated with a 50 percent decrease in beta-amyloid peptide 1 to 42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer s disease (4).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Finally, this polymorphism was recently reported to be significantly associated with general intelligence in healthy elderly people (5).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	28	Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented seemingly contradictory results concerning a potential role of CTSD polymorphism in Alzheimer s disease (6 to 19).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	29	 There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	33	   DISEASE TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of progressive cognitive impairment in the elderly, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 percent at 65 to 69 years increasing up to 40 percent in the very elderly ( > 85 years of age) (21, 22).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	40	 At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	 They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	46	35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	47	   META-ANALYSIS METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   Identification and eligibility of relevant studies We considered all studies that examined the association of the CTSD polymorphism with Alzheimer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE (from January 1994 to September 2003).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The search strategy was based on combinations of "Alzheimer s disease," "CTSD," "cathepsin D," "polymorphism," "allele," and "genetics.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	50	" References of retrieved articles were also screened.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	51	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	54	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	56	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	60	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	63	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	64	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	70	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The current evidence cannot exclude that the T allele of the CTSD polymorphism may increase modestly the risk of Alzheimer s disease, but there was significant heterogeneity in the results of various studies.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, we found that bias might exist, with a decreasing effect size, as more data accumulated over time.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Moreover, the meta-analysis also cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the CTSD T allele may enhance the increased susceptibility toward Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	159	 However, even if this is true, it would pertain to the relatively small group of subjects who carry both the APOE*4 and CTSD T alleles.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In all, the impact of the T allele on a population level would be small, if present at all.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	161	The meta-analysis findings may be interpreted against the postulated biologic context of the CTSD polymorphism.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Cathepsin D is an intracellular acid protease with beta-secretase activity in vitro (1, 2) that can cleave amyloid precursor protein and the tau protein to generate fragments with intact microtubule-binding domains (44), which might play a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	163	 One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	166	Attention should be given to the design of individual studies.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The results of meta-analyses may be affected by methodological problems and potential biases in the designs of the constituent studies.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Nondifferential misclassification errors may dilute the strength of an observed association.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Alzheimer s disease cases were generally selected according to appropriate criteria.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Studies of younger subjects may be more suitable for identifying risk factors that result in early onset Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Conversely, selection of younger subjects may be less appropriate, if the influence of the postulated genetic risk factor is more important in late-onset Alzhei-mer s disease.

0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	184	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation.
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53).
0.976726.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Nevertheless, such knowledge could improve our understanding about the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer s disease.

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	17	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Subjects and methods Results References   Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, various extraglandular symptoms, hypergammaglobulinaemia and abundant autoantibody production.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, are increased in patients with pSS [1].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	19	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene polymorphism plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, but in addition has recently also been suggested to regulate inflammation, as measured by levels of C-reactive protein [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The gene for apoE is polymorphic, presenting with three common alleles (2, 3, 4) at a single gene locus on chromosome 19.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These alleles form six genotypes: E2/2, E3/2, E4/2, E3/3, E4/3 and E4/4, of which E3/3 is the commonest and E4/3 the second commonest in most populations.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The presence of the apoE 4 allele is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease [reviewed in 3].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	23	Circulating testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels have recently been found to be associated with the apoE genotype and women carrying the apoE 4 allele thus to be more susceptible to the development of some diseases associated with the menopause [4].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Sjogren's syndrome presents characteristically in middle-aged women.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We hypothesized that apoE could be a candidate gene for susceptibility to pSS and, further, that the genetic polymorphism of apoE could exert an effect on markers of inflammation in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Hence, the aims of the present study were to investigate in a well-characterized group of Finnish Caucasian patients with pSS the effect of the polymorphism of apoE gene on susceptibility to and severity of pSS, particularly on markers of inflammation and age of onset of pSS.

0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	80	Discussion Genetic variation of the apoE gene influences susceptibility to coronary heart disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, apoE 4 being the allele with the strong association.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Recently, genetic variation in the apoE gene was also found to affect the degree of inflammation by influencing serum CRP levels in dyslipidaemic middle-aged men [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Surprisingly, however, it was the patients carrying the apoE 4 allele, known to be associated with inflammation, who were found to have lower CRP levels than the others [2].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	83	In patients with pSS, chronic inflammation is present, as shown by markedly elevated ESR levels, pronounced hypergammaglobulinaemia and elevated IL-6 levels.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	84	 We therefore hypothesized that genetic polymorphism of the apoE could have an effect on markers of inflammation in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, this proved not to be the case: first, no differences were found in the apoE genotype or allele frequencies between pSS patients and healthy controls.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Moreover, the apoE 4 allele did not influence the levels of CRP in patients with pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This finding might be explained by the fact that pSS is known to belong to a group of autoimmune diseases with a modest or even absent CRP reaction [10].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, in addition to lack of differences in CRP levels, no differences emerged in any other well-established markers of inflammatory activity, including plasma IL-6, TNF- and IgG between apoE 4 carriers and non-carriers.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The apoE 4 carrier state was also not associated with clinical features of the disease.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Labial salivary gland histology, a marker of severity of inflammation in pSS, was even milder in apoE 4 allele carriers compared with non-carriers.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	91	We found that the age at disease onset was significantly lower in pSS patients with the apoE 4 allele than in those without this allele.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Similarly, it has been noted that the effect of the apoE 4 allele on coronary atherosclerosis [11] and Alzheimer's disease [12] is age-dependent.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Moreover, in recent studies, apoE polymorphism has also been found to affect the age at onset of infectious diseases [13, 14].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	94	 ApoE polymorphism was found to affect the age of becoming infected with Plasmodium falciparum in children from Ghana [13] and to have a possible role in protection against the early stages of malaria [14].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Epstein to Barr, cytomegalovirus or retrovirus infections have been proposed to act as triggering agents in the development of pSS in genetically susceptible subjects [15].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	96	 There are no data on apoE polymorphism and susceptibility to or age at disease onset related to these infections.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	97	 We do not know the background to the significant association between apoE 4 and earlier disease onset of pSS.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	98	 One might speculate, however, that this association could be mediated, for example, through a possible effect on the time-point of a triggering viral infection.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	99	A further speculative explanation for the earlier age at onset of pSS, particularly in female subjects carrying the apoE 4 allele, might be a relation to hormonal factors, which in view of the strong female predominance among patients with pSS are also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS [15].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The gender bias and the concomitant characteristic late age of disease onset in pSS have been difficult to interpret, as oestrogens have been considered to favour autoimmunity and androgens to protect from it.
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Carriers of apoE 4 have been held to be more susceptible to the development of some diseases associated with menopause, as they have been found to have higher serum DHEA and testosterone levels than women not carrying this allele [4].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Furthermore, an interaction between oestrogen and apoE in the Alzheimer's disease process has been observed; in a recent study apoE polymorphism influenced binding to the oestrogen receptor and altered transcriptional activity in response to oestrogen [16].
0.3375625.15328426.html.plaintext.txt	103	We have demonstrated that apoE polymorphism does not affect susceptibility to pSS or plasma inflammatory indices in patients with pSS, but there is a clear association between apoE 4 allele and early onset of pSS.

0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	153	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Previous in vitro experiments have shown that residues 260 to 269 of apoE are important for the binding of apoE to lipids and lipoproteins (11).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Deletion of these residues diminished greatly the ability of the truncated apoE to solubilize multilamellar dimyristoyl-L--phosphatidylcholine vesicles.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Further deletion of residues 230 to 299 or 203 to 299 and 166 to 299 eliminated completely the ability of apoE to solubilize multilamellar dimyristoyl-L--phosphatidylcholine vesicles (11).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Thus it is possible that the carboxyl-terminal 260 to 299 amino acids of apoE may be involved in the initial association of apoE with phospholipid, a process that may be required for the formation of apoE-containing lipoproteins.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Whether the association of apoE with phospholipids in vivo requires participation of ABCA1 remains to be established.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Once apoE is lipoprotein-bound, it may be taken up by the LDL receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	159	The apoE-LDL receptor interactions control plasma cholesterol levels and confer protection from atherosclerosis (2).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The contribution of receptors other than the LDL receptor in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoprotein remnants was previously assessed by studies in apoE to / to  x LDLr to / to  double-deficient mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These studies have shown that neither the full-length apoE2 or apoE4 nor the truncated apoE2 to 202 or apoE4 to 202 corrected the high cholesterol profiles of the apoE to / to  x LDLr to / to  double-deficient mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These data and other observations with full-length apoE2 suggest strongly that apoE-mediated lipoprotein clearance in mice is carried out mainly by the LDL receptor (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In the absence of this receptor, lipoprotein receptor-related protein, other apoE recognizing lipoprotein receptors, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (22, 23) are not sufficient to clear the lipoprotein remnants, which accumulate in the plasma of the double-deficient mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In addition to the role of apoE in cholesterol homeostasis in circulation, plasma apoE levels correlate with plasma triglyceride levels in humans (24).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	165	Hypertriglyceridemia is also induced in mice by overexpression of human apoE (12 to 15, 25).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, our recent studies have shown that hypertriglyceridemia did not occur when mice were infected with adenoviruses expressing truncated apoE forms lacking the 260 to 299 carboxyl-terminal domain (12 to 16).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This set of experiments also showed that when the truncated apoE forms were co-expressed with the full-length apoE forms, they had a dominant effect and normalized the cholesterol levels of the apoE to / to  mice (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	168	These findings suggested that when full-length apoE is bound to triglyceride-rich VLDL particles, its receptor binding domain may be masked, thus preventing the direct apoE-mediated clearance of the VLDL particles prior to lipolysis.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In contrast, when truncated apoE is bound to triglyceride-rich VLDL particles, its receptor binding domain may be exposed and may allow direct clearance of the VLDL particle (15).
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	170	The current study was designed to map the residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of apoE, which are responsible for hypertriglyceridemia.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The rationale was that identification of these residues may lead to the generation of a recombinant apoE form with improved biological functions.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	172	 We have focused on two regions of apoE between residues 260 and 299, which contain hydrophobic amino acids.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The first region includes amino acids Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Val-269, and the second region includes amino acids Trp-276, Leu-279, Val-280, and Val-283.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	174	 A BLAST search of NCBI data base (www.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	175	gov) showed that both regions are highly conserved among mammalian species.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	176	 An in vivo adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the two apoE mutants established unequivocally that the hydrophobic residues of apoE between amino acids 261 to 269 can account to a large extent for the induction of hypertriglyceridemia.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Hypertriglyceridemia did not occur in mice infected with an adenovirus expressing apoE4-mut1 where these residues were changed into alanines.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In contrast, infection of mice with an adenovirus expressing apoE4-mut2, where the hydrophobic residues between amino acids 276 and 283 were substituted by alanines, resulted in milder hypertriglyceridemia as compared with mice infected with the apoE4-expressing adenovirus.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	179	It appears that the hydrophobic residues within the 261 to 269 as well as the 276 to 283 regions, affect the secretion of VLDL triglycerides.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Mutations of these residues into alanines reduced the rate of hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion to 27% of that caused by wild-type apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	181	Our data also showed that an increase in the levels of the plasma lipoprotein lipase by co-infection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the human lipoprotein lipase corrected the apoE-induced dyslipidemia in apoE to / to  mice that overexpress full-length apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This finding suggests that under the condition of apoE overexpression the activity of lipoprotein lipase becomes rate-limiting for the clearance of the hypertriglyceridemic VLDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Substantial but less severe hypertriglyceridemia is also observed by the overexpression of apoE4-mut2, which is also corrected by co-infection with the lipoprotein lipase-expressing adenovirus.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The difference in the severity of the hypertriglyceridemia between WT apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 may be related to the increased VLDL triglyceride secretion caused by the WT apoE4.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	185	An important clue on the nature of the hypertriglyceridemic lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the plasma of the mice is provided by the clearance of apoE in mice co-infected with wild-type or mutant forms of apoE- and LpL-expressing adenoviruses.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	186	 ApoE was cleared in mice treated with apoE4 and LpL, partially cleared in mice treated with apoE4-mut2 and LpL, and was unaffected in mice treated with apoE4-mut1 and LpL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The average apoE levels with or without treatment with lipoprotein lipase 2 to 6 days postinfection changed from 125 mg/dl to 10 mg/dl for apoE4, 150 mg/dl to 40 mg/dl for apoE4-mut2, and remained the same (170 mg/dl) for apoE4-mut1.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The findings indicate that wild-type apoE4 resides on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles and following the hydrolysis of the triglycerides of these particles by LpL, apoE4 is recognized and cleared as a component of the remnant particles by the LDL-receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It appears that the majority of the mutant apoE4-mut1 may reside in another population of triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Finally, the apoE4-mut2 may be partitioned in triglyceride-rich particles that are processed by LpL and cleared by the LDL receptor and triglyceride-poor particles that are not cleared by the LDL receptor.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	191	 It is possible that the mutations introduced in apoE4-mut1 and to a lesser extent in apoE4-mut2 may have promoted the formation of triglyceride-poor apoE-containing lipoprotein particles that accumulate in the HDL region of these mice.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	192	A very significant finding of this study is that apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 (W276A, L279A, V280A, and V283A) displaced apoA-I from HDL and promoted the formation of discoidal HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In contrast, apoE-mut1 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, and V269A) did not displace apoA-I from the HDL region and did not affect the formation of spherical HDL particles.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The findings suggest that when WT apoE4 or apoE4-mut2 is overexpressed, they may influence the formation or the stability of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The effect of the apoE mutations on the biosynthesis and catabolism of VLDL and HDL is summarized in Fig.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	196	At the present time, it is not clear whether apoE overexpression interferes with the biogenesis of HDL through a pathway that involves the ABCA1 transporter or whether it affects its stability by displacing apoA-I from the surface of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Both processes are expected to reduce the levels of HDL.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The undesirable property of WT apoE to reduce plasma HDL levels can be overcome in the recombinant apoE4-mut1, were the hydrophobic residues in the 261 to 269 region were mutated into alanines.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	199	The ability of recombinant apoE forms such as apoE4-mut1 to clear cholesterol without inducing hypertriglyceridemia or interfering with the formation of spherical HDL, makes them attractive therapeutic agents to correct remnant removal disorders.
0.34268814.15576362.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therapeutic forms of apoE may involve pure recombinant protein associated with liposomes and potential gene therapy in the future.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received October 28, 1997; Revised and Accepted December 19, 1997.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	4	The [epsis]4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), one of the main allele of APOE polymorphism, is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, several data suggest that genetic factors, within the APOE locus, may also modulate the risk associated with this polymorphism.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We look for new mutations in the APOE promoter, susceptible to modify the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We characterised a G[rarr]T mutation at -186 bp of the APOE gene TATA box, named Th1/E47cs.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This new polymorphism is located in a consensus sequence of a potential transcriptional (Th1/E47) factor binding site.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We studied the impact of this new polymorphism with those of other markers of the APOE locus in a large case-control study and observed that Th1/E47cs modulated the influence of the APOE [epsis]4 allele on the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	10	The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), a key player of the lipid transport, exists as three main alleles in the general population: [epsis]2, [epsis]3 and [epsis]4.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These polymorphisms correspond to mutations in the coding sequence of the APOE gene resulting in amino acid substitutions (Arg and Cys) at positions 112 and 158 of the protein.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This gene is located on chromosome 19 at position q13.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The implication of chromosome 19 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was suspected on at least three occasions (1-3) before the report of an association between late-onset AD and the APOE [epsis]4 allele (4).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Numerous studies confirmed this finding and extended this observation to early-onset AD (5-7).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It is now established that carrying an [epsis]4 allele increases the risk of AD in an allele dose dependent manner and shifts the age of onset of the disease to earlier ages (8).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Conversely, bearing an [epsis]2 allele confers a protection against the disease (5,9,10).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus, the APOE genotype appears as an important biological marker for AD susceptibility accounting for between 45 and 60% of AD genetic variability.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	18	Several biological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie this association.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The E4 isoform would facilitate or not limit the amyloid substance deposition (11,12).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This isoform may not protect against oxidative stress, in contrast to the E2 isoform (13).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It has also been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms would prevent the aggregation of Tau protein by limiting abnormal phosphorylation leading to the constitution of paired helical filament, while the E4 isoform would not (14).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	22	However, none of these hypotheses fully explained why as many as 50% of homozygous subjects who survive until 80 years, do not develop AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This observation suggests that other factors should influence the APOE associated risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Indeed, other genetic and environmental factors such as family history, gender, smoking, oestrogen, cholesterol level or other polymorphisms located in APOE receptor genes for instance (15-20), may modify the APOE associated risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, recent reports suggest that additional genetic factors within the APOE locus itself may also modulate this risk.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Firstly, a genetic study of markers in the vicinity of the APOE locus demonstrated that a combination of three polymorphisms increases the estimation of the APOE associated risk of AD compared with APOE polymorphism alone (5).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Secondly, a distortion of the allelic expression of the APOE gene is observed in the brain of affected patients; indeed, the relative expression of the [epsis]4 allele is increased 1.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	28	5-fold in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer AD patients, compared with [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer controls (21).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	29	Together, these data suggest the potential existence of one or more additional genetic susceptibility factors in the APOE sequence, modifying the risk associated with the APOE [epsis]4 allele in the occurrence of AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Detailed sequence analyses and a study of the APOE locus are needed to characterise such additional genetic factors.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	31	 reported a polymorphism (1E1) in the first intron of the APOE gene in strong linkage disequilibrium with the APOE [epsis]4 allele (22).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	32	To go further in this hunt for other polymorphism(s), we sequenced the 375 bp upstream of the APOE TATA box and detected a new polymorphism whose impact on AD risk, together with the APOE [epsis]4 allele was investigated in a large case-control study.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	33	Sequencing the 375 bp upstream to the TATA box of APOE, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism at position -186 of the TATA box, located in a potential consensus binding sequence of the Th1/E47 heterodimer transcriptional factor (Fig.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Because of this location, we named it Th1/E47cs polymorphism (for Th1/E47 consensus sequence polymorphism).

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We analysed the Th1/E47cs polymorphism together with the APOE, the 1E1 and the D19S178 repeat polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The distributions of these polymorphisms are presented in Table 1.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	44	 No deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for any of these polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	45	 As expected, the [epsis]4 allele was strongly associated with AD (OR = 4.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	46	67]), while the [epsis]2 allele exhibited a protective effect (OR = 0.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In the control population, the Th1/E47cs G allele was the common one (0.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The allelic and genotypic distributions were significantly different in the AD cases when compared with the control cases (P = 0.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	52	 For the 1E1 polymorphism, the allelic and genotypic distributions, similar to the ones reported by Mui et al.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	53	 (20), were significantly different between the AD and control populations (P = 0.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The 1E1 C allele was associated with a decreased risk of developing AD (OR = 0.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	55	 No difference in the allelic or genotypic distributions of the D19S178 repeat alleles was observed (P = 0.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	56	We calculated pairwise linkage disequilibriums between D19S178, Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms (Table 2).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	57	 As expected significant linkage disequilibriums existed between Th1/E47cs, 1E1 and APOE polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	58	 D19S178 was independent of the other polymorphisms, although a weak linkage disequilibrium existed with APOE in the control population.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	59	We estimated the haplotypes generated by these four polymorphisms using the myriad haplotype algorithm.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Among the 16 theoretical haplotypes, 15 were observed (Table 3a).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	61	 All haplotypes were observed in AD cases, while three (nos 2, 5 and 7) were not represented in controls.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The difference in the distribution of the estimated haplotype frequencies between cases and controls was tested with a likelihood ratio test with 13 degrees of freedom ([chi]2 = 696).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	63	 To take into account the strong association of the APOE [epsis]4 allele with AD, we compared the estimated haplotype distributions in the [epsis]3/[epsis]3 and in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 AD and control subgroups (Table 3b and c).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In each subgroup ([epsis]3/[epsis]3 and [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, respectively), the estimated haplotype distributions were significantly different between AD and control subjects (likelihood test [chi]2 = 374, df = 8 and [chi]2 = 160, df = 6, respectively), suggesting potential independent effect of the other polymorphisms.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	91	If we assume that the level of expression of the APOE alleles is increased due to cis mutations in the promoter region, this hypothesis has three major implications: (i) the promoter mutation may modulate the expression of the APOE alleles leading to an increased deleterious risk for [epsis]4 and to an increased protective effect for [epsis]2; (ii) given that what determines the risk is the importance of the relative level of expression of both alleles of the APOE, this promoter mutation will have a differential effect in APOE heterozygous and homozygous genotypes; (iii) the effect of the cis mutation in heterozygous individuals will depend on the phase of this polymorphism with the APOE [epsis] alleles (i.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In heterozygous Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis]4 genotype bearers, the [epsis]4 allele may be combined either with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Thus, in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers, the risk of developing AD will be different between the Th1/E47cs heterozygous and homozygous individuals.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	95	 To test these assumptions, we studied the gender and age adjusted OR for developing AD for Th1/E47cs heterozygous genotype bearers compared with homozygous Th1/E47cs individuals.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Altogether, these data suggest that the Th1/E47cs polymorphism could modify the relative level of expression of the APOE alleles.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	108	In order to approach the influence of the phase of the Th1/E47cs and APOE polymorphisms on the AD risk, we estimated the frequencies of the haplotypes with the Th1/E47cs T or G allele associated with the [epsis]4 allele in the AD or controls [epsis]3/[epsis]4 bearer populations (as described in Materials and Methods).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	109	 For the APOE [epsis]3/[epsis]4 and Th1/E47cs G/T bearers, 57.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	110	6% of the controls were estimated to have the [epsis]4 and T alleles on the same chromosome, while this proportion was 69.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	111	7% in the case group, leading to an estimated OR of 1.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	112	Recently, the hypothesis of other(s) mutation(s) nearby the APOE gene was fuelled by new physiological data: a difference in the allelic expression of the APOE gene was observed (19), suggesting that non-coding polymorphism(s) in the regulatory regions of the APOE gene could modify the risk of developing AD.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Looking for such new polymorphisms, we found a (G[rarr]T) polymorphism located at position +7 of a degenerative E-box consensus (Fig.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	114	 1) (23), that influenced the effect of APOE polymorphisms on AD in the expected way.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	115	The Th1/E47cs and 1E1 polymorphisms were associated with AD when studied separately.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Although a strong linkage disequilibrium existed between the [epsis]4, Th1/E47cs T and 1E1 G alleles, the effect of each of these polymorphisms persisted when introduced in the same logistic regression model.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	117	 This observation suggested that the risk associated with the APOE [epsis] alleles may be modulated according to their combination with other polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	118	 To have at least one Th1/E47cs T or 1E1 C allele significantly modified the risk of developing AD in the whole population.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Furthermore, the impact of the [epsis]4 allele seemed decreased, suggesting that part of its effect may be attributed to the promoter polymorphisms.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Another argument was brought forward when estimating the risk associated with the phase.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The estimated risk of developing the disease for the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 genotype bearers was not similar according to the combination of the Th1/E47cs and APOE [epsis] alleles on the same chromosome.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	122	 These results were in accordance with our previous data which suggest that the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 individuals will preferentially develop AD, because they expressed the [epsis]4 allele at a greater level.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Thus, a cis mutation in the APOE promoter, may favour the relative expression level of the [epsis]4 allele, and potentially the deleterious action of the E4 isoform.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	124	The Th1/E47cs polymorphism was characterised into a binding site of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, E47.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This factor E47 belongs to the class A proteins which are ubiquitously expressed and form combinatorial interactions with the class B proteins to control tissue-specific gene expression (24).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In particular, E47 is expressed in brain, associated with multiple class B protein and is implicated in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system (25-27).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Little is known about the Th1 factor.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	128	 It was identified in a screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Its homologous protein in Drosophila is a partner for the Drosophila class A protein daughterless, expression of which is essential for neurogenesis (28).
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	130	Nevertheless it is essential to determine, in vitro and in vivo, the functionality of this transcriptional factor sequence binding.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Furthermore, the effect of this new polymorphism susceptible to modulate the risk associated to the APOE alleles must be confirmed by other epidemiological studies and a more profound analysis will have to be performed to determine the haplotypes.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In conclusion, The Th1/E47cs polymorphism, located within a putative regulatory element of the APOE promoter could contribute to the APOE expression level but other polymorphisms in the regulatory sequences of this gene may exist and a more extended screening of these regulatory regions needs to be developed.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The regulation of the APOE gene could be very important for deciphering the mechanisms of the involvement of the APOE alleles, in particular to better define subjects at higher risk of developing AD.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Because the Th1/E47cs polymorphism did not create or destroy any restriction enzyme sites, two techniques were used to confirm the results.
0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The first one consisted of designing a mismatch primer which contained one mismatched base pair, four bases away from the 3[prime] end of the forward primer and five bases from the polymorphism.

0.4035247.9467014.html.plaintext.txt	187	Because our estimation is performed in the [epsis]3/[epsis]4 sub-population with equal total proportion of [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 alleles, we have: 2.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	27	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Most of the highly publicised advances in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease have concerned those very rare families with autosomal dominant forms of the disease, so-called familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindred, in which 50% of each generation, regardless of gender, succumb to Alzheimer's disease, usually by early mid-life (reviewed by Selkoe, 1999).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Yet, it is important to be able to recognise FAD because it is possible to offer such kindreds definitive genetic counselling, provided that the causative mutation can be identified.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, a study by Campion et al (1999) suggests that FAD may occur at a frequency of around 40 per 100 000 persons at risk, which implies that there are some 600 affected individuals to be found in England and Wales, a number that suggests that a psychiatrist or neurologist will encounter an individual from a FAD pedigree at some time in their working life.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	34	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   The function of the psychiatrist is straight-forward.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The first step is to confirm that the diagnosis is actually one of Alzheimer's disease and not one of the other, often familial, dementias such as Huntington's disease, frontal-temporal dementias, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Next, the clinician should take as detailed a family history as possible in order to try to determine whether the sufferer comes from a pedigree with autosomal dominant FAD: the occurrence of numerous individuals with early-onset disease ( < 55 years) in several generations is highly suggestive.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The presence of many affected individuals in one generation may also raise suspicion because it should not be forgotten that early death from other causes might prevent manifestation of the disorder in carriers of a disease gene.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In practice, we recommend that families containing three members with a history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease occurring before the age of 60 years should, if they request advice, be referred to a clinical geneticist.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Some forms of FAD linked to PSEN2 mutations occur after the age of 65 years, and so the psychiatrist should have a low threshold for discussing a pedigree with a clinical geneticist.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	40	Predictive or prenatal testing is potentially feasible in families with FAD but will depend upon the availability of DNA from at least one affected individual in order to establish which mutation is causing disease in that family.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	41	 It is worth stating that genetic counselling is a highly specialised area and it is strongly recommended that psychiatrists do not involve themselves without the appropriate training.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	42	The study by Campion et al (1999) analysed DNA from 34 families with FAD (obtained from all over France) for causative mutations.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Probably pathogenic mutations were found in the PSEN1 gene in 19 families, mutations within the APP gene in another 5 and no mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP genes in the remaining 10 families.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, individuals from FAD pedigrees need to be informed that there is a 30% chance that, with the current state of our knowledge, no causative mutation will be found.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	45	 If no mutation is found then, if the pedigree is strongly suggestive of an autosomal dominant disorder, the geneticist may choose to go on to search for mutations in genes associated with similar conditions   prion protein (PrP) in CJD and tau in frontal temporal dementias, for example.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Yet another factor to consider is that there has been one report of apparent non-penetrance of a PSEN1 mutation in a healthy 68-year-old member of a FAD pedigree (Rossor et al, 1996).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Notwithstanding these caveats, in the absence of any preventive treatment, the take-up for predictive testing is likely to be low, as has been the case in Huntington's disease (Binedell et al, 1998).

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Here inheritance does not follow simple Mendelian ratios but appears to reflect the presence of a number of different genetic risk factors together with environmental factors.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	53	When faced with someone who is worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease it is often worth pointing out that we are all at some risk of developing Alzheimer's disease provided that we live long enough.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The large Rotterdam study suggests that the risk at age 55 years of developing dementia in the following 35 years is 0.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In this study 73% of dementia was wholly or partially attributable to Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The large continuing Framingham study yields somewhat lower lifetime risks of Alzheimer's disease after the age of 65 years: 6.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	57	3% for men and 12% for women, with a corresponding risk for all dementia of 10.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	58	9% and 19%, respectively (Seshadri et al, 1997).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The reasons for this are not clear, but increased longevity compared to men, increased survival with the disease and some increase in intrinsic vulnerability probably all play a part.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	61	Prevalence studies tell us that dementia doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 years up to the age of around 85 years, after which time the rate of increase appears to slow (Heeren et al, 1991; Skoog et al, 1993; Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995; Breitner et al, 1999; von Strauss et al, 1999).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It is likely that some of this slowing is due to very old people not living as long with their dementia as younger sufferers do, although it is also possible that survivors into late old age are relatively resistant to developing dementia (Drachman, 1994).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Prevalence data are summarised in Table 1.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	64	View this table:    Table 1 Prevalence of dementia by age (from Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995, with permission)  .
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	65	In fact, two nearly completely ascertained community-based studies, one from Japan and one from The Netherlands, found that the prevalence of dementia in centenarians was very high: 70% in the Japanese and 88% in the Dutch sample (Asada et al, 1996; Blansjaar et al, 2000).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Asada et al (1996) attributed some 76% of the dementia to Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate was 27% for the centenarians with dementia, whereas none of the non-demented centenarians died.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	67	Thus, prevalence figures for dementia tell us that many of us are at some risk of developing dementia, provided that we live long enough.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This is obviously too simplistic: most people do not expect to live into their mid-90s; a much more reasonable question is, "What is my chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by the age of 85 years?".
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Family studies in Alzheimer's disease can go some way towards allowing us to answer this question for the relatives of affected individuals.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	73	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   In the 1980s and early 1990s there were a number of family studies that attempted to identify the inheritance pattern of Alzheimer's disease and to quantify the risk to first-degree relatives in families with a history of Alzheimer's disease, in comparison with family members of control individuals (summarised in McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	74	 There have also been a few studies based on more representative community samples.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	75	Overall, the findings from studies based in memory clinics (that are likely to be centres of secondary referral) suggest that 30-48% of probands with Alzheimer's disease have a history of affected first-degree relatives compared with 13-19% of controls.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This translates to 6-14% of the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease having a history of Alzheimer's disease compared with 3.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	77	5-7% of the first-degree relatives of healthy controls.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Kaplan Meier life table analysis has been used in these studies to infer that the cumulative risk of dementia by age 90 varies between 30 and 50% compared with between 10 and 23% in control relatives.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, as has been pointed out by Breitner, owing to competing causes of death, only about one-third of this theoretical familial predisposition to Alzheimer's disease is realised in the usual life span.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	80	 This translates to an actual predicted risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease of 15-19%, compared with 5% in controls (Breitner et al, 1988; Breitner, 1991).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	81	The latest systematically ascertained twin studies on the heritability of Alzheimer's disease also tend to support the estimates of familial risk derived from family studies.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Probandwise, concordance rates of about 40% and 84%, respectively, are seen in fraternal and identical twins (Bergem et al, 1997).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Because fraternal twins are genetically equivalent to ordinary first-degree relatives, the observed morbid risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is similar to that estimated for first-degree relatives in family studies.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	84	A study by Silverman et al (1994) suggested that, in large measure, the familial component of risk to the relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease was expended by the end of the ninth decade, after which time the risk was very similar to that in controls.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	85	 A number of other family history studies have suggested that familial factors are more prominent when onset is earlier (McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, much of Alzheimer's disease in late old age may be considered as not very familial and merely an expression of one of the ways in which the ageing process is manifested in those few survivors into late old age.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	87	The findings from these family studies can be used to advise relatives in only the broadest terms.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	88	 One can do little more than to say that, on balance, the risk to the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease who developed the disorder at any time up to the age of 85 years is increased some threefold to fourfold relative to the risk in controls.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This would seem to translate to a risk of developing Alzheimer's disease of between one in five and one in six, which, although an improvement on a risk of one in two, can still be rather frightening.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In order to put this risk into better perspective, and to help allay the client's anxiety, it may be preferable to present the risk estimates in a graphical form, as is done in Fig.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If this is done, clients can see that even at 78 years, the age of greatest risk, the actual predicted risk is only some 3% and that the cumulative risk (half the area under the curve f(x) S(x)) from age 65 to 78 is probably less than 10%.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In our experience many tell us that this is reassuring   partly because their worries were about getting Alzheimer's disease in their fifties "because this is when familial Alzheimer's disease happens" or in their sixties/seventies, thus preventing them from enjoying retirement.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	98	In the case of patients with Alzheimer's disease who became demented late in old age, say by their 80s, relatives probably run the same 30-50% risk of developing dementia as anyone else who lives to the age of 90 years and beyond.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Of course, it is possible that some of the same genes that confer longevity may also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like other disorders that reflect the combined action of several genes, the risk to relatives drops rapidly as the degree of genetic relatedness falls.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Data are limited but the risk to second-degree relatives, such as grand-children, is probably less than twice the population levels (Heston et al, 1981).

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	120	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Most studies show that patients with Alzheimer's disease having APOE 4 deteriorate no more rapidly than those without this allele (Corder et al, 1995; Growdon et al, 1996; Holmes et al, 1996; Kurz et al, 1996; Stern et al, 1997).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	121	 It is possible that APOE 4 is a marker for a poor response to treatment with acetylcholinesterese inhibitors, particularly, perhaps, in women (Poirer et al, 1995; Farlow et al, 1998).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	122	The consensus of opinion appears to be that APOE genotype determines  when  rather than  whether  one succumbs to Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	123	 For example, the Cache County study (Meyer et al, 1998, Breitner et al, 1999) on an elderly population of almost 5000 found 22 cases of Alzheimer's disease among 141 APOE 4 homozygotes, 118 among 1452 APOE 4 heterozygotes and 80 among 3339 not bearing the APOE 4 allele.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	124	 There appeared to be a plateau in each group's survival curve beyond which no new cases of Alzheimer's disease were seen.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	125	 For APOE 4 homozygotes no new cases were seen after the age of 84 years, with nine individuals surviving without Alzheimer's disease for a combined total of a further 37 years.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	126	 For APOE 4 heterozygotes the last onset of Alzheimer's disease was at 99 years, with four long-term survivors.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The last onset of dementia in individuals without the APOE 4 allele was at age 95 years, with 31 surviving free of dementia for a combined total of 100 years thereafter.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This differential effect of APOE genotype on the age of maximum risk of Alzheimer's disease is also suggested in the APOE meta-analysis of Farrer et al (1997) and also in the study by Asada et al (1996).
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	129	A Bayesian analysis has been used by Seshadri et al (1995) to relate the APOE genotype to the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	130	 When the estimates of dementia risk derived from the Framingham study (Seshadri et al, 1997) are substituted in the analysis, somewhat lower risk estimates, which are stratified according to gender, are obtained (Table 2).

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	132	These estimates suggest that, at most, some 50% of APOE 4 homozygotes will develop Alzheimer's disease within their lifetime.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	133	 These predictions agree well with the general population-based study of Henderson et al (1995), which suggested that the risk of developing dementia by age 90 years in APOE 4 homozygotes was about 50%.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	137	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   From the foregoing it is obvious that knowledge of a person's APOE genotype is of little more use in predicting their chances of succumbing to Alzheimer's disease than is knowledge of their family history of dementia.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It seems that even individuals with the APOE 4/APOE 4 genotype have, on average, a greater than 50% chance of escaping the disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Therefore, APOE genotyping currently has no role in predicting the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	140	Some claims have been made that APOE genotyping may be an aid to diagnosing Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The study by Mayeux et al (1998) suggested that for patients referred to specialised assessment centres for Alzheimer's disease, APOE genotyping used in combination with clinical criteria might improve the specificity of the diagnosis.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The data show that whereas the demonstration of one or more APOE 4 allele in a person suspected of suffering with dementia slightly increases the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, the absence of an APOE 4 allele has little value in either endorsing or refuting a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Thus, even in a selected group of patients, presumably all with a high a priori chance of Alzheimer's disease, APOE genotyping seems to confer negligible diagnostic benefit.

0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	160	 So, when asked "am I likely to get Alzheimer's disease?" by the relative of a patient with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, how should one answer? In most cases of Alzheimer's disease it is only possible to advise relatives of their risk in the broadest terms.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Extrapolating from family history studies, it is possible to say that the risk to the children is in the region of one in five to one in six and one should be prepared to illustrate what this means in an easy to understand graphical form.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We believe that it is permissible for such a broad estimate of risk to be imparted by a consultant or doctor not specifically trained in genetic counselling.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	163	Occasionally, psychiatrists encounter families with several siblings affected by late-onset Alzheimer's disease and a history of dementia in previous generations.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Such families almost certainly exhibit high genetic loading, but there are few reliable data on whether and to what extent risk increases with the number of affected relatives, although studies of other common disorders suggest that this is likely to be the case.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, it should be borne in mind that the number of affected relatives may well depend on factors affecting longevity as well as on the degree of genetic loading for Alzheimer's disease, and it may not be advisable or possible to base discussion on risk estimates that are increased when several relatives have been affected in late old age.
0.41210636.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	166	 There is also preliminary evidence for substantially increased risk in the offspring of parents who both have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Bird et al, 1993).

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	3	The allelic frequency of the gene for the K variant of butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE-K) was 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	4	17 in 74 subjects with late-onset (age >65 years) histopathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), which was higher than the frequencies in 104 elderly control subjects (0.

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	6	07) and in 29 confirmed cases of other dementia (0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The association of BCHE-K with late-onset AD was limited to carriers of the [epsilon]4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), among whom the presence of BCHE-K gave an odds ratio of confirmed late-onset AD of 6.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	8	65-29) in subjects >65 years and of 12.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In APOE[epsilon]4 carriers over 75 years, only 1/22 controls, compared with 10/24 confirmed late-onset AD cases, had BCHE-K.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We suggest that BCHE-K, or a nearby gene on chromosome 3, acts in synergy with APOE[epsilon]4 as a susceptibility gene for late-onset AD.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	11	Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is expressed in most human tissues (1 ), yet its function is unknown.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	12	 BChE activity in the brain increases with age over 60 years and is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2 ,3 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Histochemically reactive BChE is associated with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and with amyloid angiopathy in AD (4 -8 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We have looked for possible associations of AD with two of the more common human variants of the gene for BChE (BCHE), the atypical allele and the K variant (BCHE-K).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The latter has a point mutation at nucleotide 1615 (GCA - >  ACA) which changes Ala539 to threonine and the catalytic activity is reduced by a third (9 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	16	 BCHE-K is thought to have an allelic frequency of ~0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	17	After 178 subjects had been genotyped, three control subjects out of 104 and three AD cases out of 74 were identified as heterozygotes for the atypical BCHE allele.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, no association was found between histopathologically confirmed AD and the atypical allele of BCHE.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Two out of the six atypical BCHE heterozygotes were carriers of BCHE-K.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	20	Altogether, 282 Caucasian subjects were genotyped for BCHE-K and for APOE alleles.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	21	 BCHE-K was more common in late-onset AD cases than in early-onset AD cases, other dementias or controls (Table 1 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For subjects aged over 65, the allelic frequency of BCHE-K was 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	23	17 in 74 confirmed AD cases, giving an odds ratio of AD of 2.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Most of this association appeared to be due to subjects over 75 years old, for whom the frequency of BCHE-K was 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	25	19 in 36 confirmed AD cases ([chi]2 with Yates' correction = 4.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	26	03), giving an odds ratio of AD of 2.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	27	 There were insufficient cases for this trend with age to reach significance, but nevertheless we thought it helpful to show data for the >75 years subgroup as well as for all subjects >65 years in Table 2 .
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	28	Taking account of an individual's carrier status for APOE [epsilon]4 produced striking results.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In subjects >65 years without APOE [epsilon]4, the allelic frequency of BCHE-K was 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	30	14 in 22 confirmed AD cases and 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	31	 There was thus no association of BCHE-K with late-onset AD in subjects lacking an APOE [epsilon]4 allele.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In APOE [epsilon]4 carriers, however, BCHE-K allelic frequencies in subjects aged >65 years were 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	33	18 in 52 confirmed AD cases and only 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	34	03 in 32 controls; in subjects aged >75 years the frequencies were 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	35	23 in 24 confirmed AD cases and 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These results gave odds ratios of confirmed AD of 6.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	37	8 for BCHE-K in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers aged >65 years and >75 years, respectively (Table 2 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	38	 For comparison, we give in Table 3 the odds ratios of confirmed AD for APOE [epsilon]4 in BCHE-K carriers.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	39	 It can be seen that an individual's BCHE-K status markedly influences the strength of the effect of APOE [epsilon]4.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Table 4 shows the striking differences between cases and controls in the proportions of subjects who carry both BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4 alleles.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	41	All these findings indicated an interaction between BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, which we confirmed by logistic regression analysis.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We fitted several logistic regression models to the data and found that a parsimonious model with only APOE [epsilon]4, BCHE-K and their interaction gave an adequate fit (residual deviance: 5.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In this model, APOE [epsilon]4 and its interaction with BCHE-K were significantly associated with AD, but BCHE-K by itself was not.

0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	67	In order to examine further the strength of the interaction between BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, we give in Table 5 the odds ratios of confirmed AD for subjects with different combinations of these two genes, taking subjects who have neither gene as the reference.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In subjects over 65 years, the odds ratio in those who only carry BCHE-K was 1.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	69	1 and in those with only APOE [epsilon]4 it was 3.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This gave a predicted odds ratio of 4.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	71	2 in subjects with both genes, on the assumption of independent effects of the two genes, compared with the observed value of 30.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In subjects over 75 years, the predicted odds ratio was 1.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	73	7, but the observed odds ratio was 36.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	74	 We therefore suggest that there is strong synergy between these two alleles in late-onset AD.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	75	That APOE [epsilon]4 is a risk factor for AD is well established (12 ,13 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that BCHE-K is associated with a further increase in the risk of late-onset AD in APOE [epsilon]4 carriers.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The effect could be due to linkage disequilibrium with another gene on chromosome 3, conceivably transferrin, whose C2 variant was reported to be more common in 20 clinically diagnosed AD cases than in the general population (14 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	78	2 (15 ), while the gene for transferrin is at 3q21-q25 (16 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	79	 On the other hand, the effect on late-onset AD might be mediated by BCHE-K itself.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	80	There are various potential interactions between BChE and apolipoprotein E (apoE).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Both proteins are produced in quantity in the liver and secreted into the circulation (1 ,17 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Not only apoE, but probably also BChE, interact with lipoproteins (18 ,19 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Both proteins are found in astrocytes (20 ,21 ) and in other glia, BChE in oligodendrocytes (22 ) and apoE in microglia (23 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Both proteins occur in AD in plaques, intra- and extracellular neurofibrillary tangles and in association with amyloid angiopathy (7 ,8 ,24 ,25 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Furthermore, both BChE and apoE have been implicated in certain models of neurite growth (26 -31 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In the case of apoE, there are differences between the E3 and E4 isoforms (29 -31 ) and, in the case of BChE, it has been suggested that the nature of the attached sugar residues may be important (26 -28 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	87	 It should be noted that the K variant of BChE has an additional threonine residue at position 539, but whether this is a potential O-glycosylation site (or, indeed, a phosphorylation site) remains to be shown.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Furthermore, a threonine residue has a high propensity for [beta]-sheet formation (32 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In lysozyme, conversion of an isoleucine residue to threonine causes amyloidosis (33 ), as does conversion of an alanine residue to threonine in transthyretin (34 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	90	The evidence cited provides pointers for future work to test the hypothesis that BChE and apoE may interact and that this interaction is influenced by their allelic variants.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Implications for clinical genetics.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	92	Replication of our findings is particularly important since ~6% of the Caucasian population carry both BCHE-K and APOE [epsilon]4, assuming respective allelic frequencies of 0.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus, subject to confirmation of our results, several millions of the elderly who carry both these genes are at high risk of developing AD, especially when aged over 75 years.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	94	 As pointed out by Roses (36 ), the ability to identify such at-risk individuals has major social and ethical implications.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Since APOE [epsilon]4 is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it will be important to see whether carriers who also have BCHE-K are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Such a study would not only have clinical relevance but could also increase our understanding about the role of vascular risk factors (37 ) in the aetiology of AD.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	97	We examined 282 Caucasians from the Oxford region recruited into the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) (38 ).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Eighty eight were autopsy confirmed CERAD (39 ) `definite or probable' AD cases (74 late-, i.
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	99	 >65 years, and 14 early-onset), 29 were pathologically confirmed cases of other dementias (12 vascular, five Parkinson's, five non-specific neurodegeneration, three Pick's, and one each of progressive supranuclear palsy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Huntington's and glioma), 61 were living cases diagnosed `possible AD' or `probable AD' by NINCDS/ADRDA (40 ) criteria (31 late- and 30 early-onset) and 104 were controls without cognitive impairment with CAMDEX (41 ) scores >80 (14 had died and had no AD pathology on necropsy).
0.34592706.9302273.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Subjects were genotyped blind to diagnosis, using blood samples, by PCR methods for the atypical and K variants of BCHE (42 ) and for APOE (43 ).

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive mental deterioration and blindness, is caused by mutations in a polytopic membrane protein (CLN6) with unknown intracellular localization and function.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In this study, transient transfection of BHK21 cells with CLN6 cDNA and immunoblot analysis using peptide-specific CLN6 antibodies demonstrated the expression of a 27-kDa protein that does not undergo proteolytic processing.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Cross-linking experiments revealed the presence of CLN6 dimers.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Using double immunofluorescence microscopy, epitope-tagged CLN6 was shown to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no colocalization with the cis-Golgi or lysosomal markers.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The translocation into the ER and proper folding were confirmed by the N-linked glycosylation of a mutant CLN6 polypeptide.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Pulse-chase labeling of fibroblasts from CLN6 patients and from sheep (OCL6) and mouse (nclf) models of the disease followed by immunoprecipitation of cathepsin D indicated that neither the synthesis, sorting nor the proteolytic processing of this lysosomal enzyme was affected in CLN6-defective cells.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the degradation of the endocytosed index protein arylsulfatase A was strongly reduced in all of the mutant CLN6 cell lines compared with controls.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These data suggest that defects in the ER-resident CLN6 protein lead to lysosomal dysfunctions, which may result in lysosomal accumulation of storage material.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs),1 also collectively called Batten disease, are a group of autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative diseases that affect both children and adults.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The clinical features include loss of vision, seizures, and mental and motor deterioration.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Depending on the affected gene, the clinical signs become visible at various developmental stages (1).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Currently, eight forms of human NCLs (CLN1 to 8) can be differentiated for which six underlying genes have been identified (2).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CLN1 and CLN2 encode for soluble lysosomal enzymes, palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidylpeptidase 1, respectively (3 to 5).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	16	 CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, and CLN8 represent transmembrane proteins of still unknown function (6 to 10).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although the nature of these CLN genes differs, defects in most of them lead to massive storage of autofluorescent material in lysosomes that has been identified as the subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (2, 11, 12).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	18	Newly synthesized palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidylpeptidase 1 are transported to the lysosome in a Man-6-P-dependent manner (3, 5).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Binding to Man-6-P-specific receptors, MPR46 and MPR300, allows the segregation from the secretory pathway and transport from the trans-Golgi-network to the endosomal compartment.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Because of the low pH, the receptor-ligand complexes dissociate and the enzymes are delivered to the lysosome.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Soluble enzymes that escape binding to the MPR in the trans-Golgi network are secreted but can be partially endocytosed after binding to MPR localized at the cell surface and transported to the lysosome (13).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	22	 CLN3, CLN5, and CLN8 have been localized in lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment, respectively (14 to 16).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The subcellular localization of CLN6 is not known.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The transport of lysosomal membrane proteins requires tyrosine- or dileucine-based sorting signals (17).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Recently, lysosomal targeting motifs have been identified in CLN3 protein (18), whereas the localization of CLN8 in the ER is mediated by a KKXX-ER-retrieval signal (16).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	26	The CLN6 gene encodes a highly conserved 311 amino acid protein with six to seven predicted membrane-spanning domains.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The deduced amino acid sequence contains no putative N-glycosylation sites or classical lysosomal sorting signals.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Furthermore, no sequence homologies to other proteins have been described (9, 10).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	29	Various mutations of the CLN6 gene have been identified, leading to the variant late infantile form of NCL (9, 10, 19 to 21).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Naturally occurring NCLs in South Hampshire and Merino sheep (OCL6) and nclf mice have been localized to CLN6 (22 to 24).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The severe and progressive neurodegeneration of the cerebral cortex is accompanied by astrocytosis and elevated expression of the radical scavenger protein Mn-SOD (24, 25).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, differences in the fatty acid profiles of brain phosphatidylethanolamine have been observed in OCL6-affected sheep (26).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	33	In this study, we expressed human CLN6 in BHK21 cells to investigate its subcellular localization.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, the transport of lysosomal enzymes via the biosynthetic and endocytic pathway was examined in fibroblasts from CLN6 patients, OCL6, and nclf mice.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The data indicate that CLN6 is an ER-resident protein.

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Here we report that CLN6 is an ER-resident protein capable of forming dimers.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Furthermore, neither the synthesis, the sorting, nor the transport of newly synthesized CtsD, a lysosomal protease, was impaired in CLN6-defective cells, whereas the degradation of an exogenous protein, ASA was reduced.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	184	Several lines of evidence imply the translocation and localization of the CLN6 protein to the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	185	 First, the CLN6 antigenic sites were found to colocalize with PDI, an established ER marker, but not with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 or with lysosomes stained for CtsD.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Secondly, the CLN6 protein does not undergo proteolytic processing steps.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thirdly, although it contains no potential N-glycosylation sites, the replacement of the residue isoleucine 153 by serine located in the second proposed luminal loop (amino acid residues 137 to 179) resulted in the addition of an oligosaccharide chain that could be removed by PNGase F treatment.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The mutant CLN6 was also completely sensitive to endo H removing the high mannose ER-type oligosaccharide chains but not complex Golgi-type oligosaccharides.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	189	 These data strongly support the concept of CLN6 residency in the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	190	ER residency of membrane proteins is achieved by retention and/or retrieval mechanisms requiring signal structures and targeting motifs within the proteins.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Thus, ER-resident, type I transmembrane proteins contain a dileucine motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, whereas an arginine-containing signal structure functions as targeting signal in some type II membrane proteins (41, 44, 45).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Recent studies have revealed additional ER retention signals such as RXR (R = arginine, X = a large neutral or positively charged residue) (46 to 48).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Furthermore, the oligomerization of proteins mediated by transmembrane and/or luminal domains forming large homodimeric or heteromeric protein complexes might prevent package into transport vesicles and export from the ER (44, 49, 50).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The signal structures responsible for the retention of the polytopic CLN6 in the ER are not known.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Both the N- and the C-terminal domain harbor potential RRR and RKK retention motifs.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	196	 However, the replacement of these motifs by lysine and leucine residues, respectively, did not alter the ER localization of the mutant CLN6.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	197	2 It is also possible that the dimerization reported in this study or the assembly of CLN6 in oligomeric complexes prevents its export from the ER.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	198	The function of CLN6 has not been defined.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, the comparable rates of synthesis, sorting, and proteolytic processing of CtsD in CLN6-defective and control cells as well as similar specific activities of two lysosomal enzymes, -hexosaminidase and ASA, suggest that CLN6 does not limit transport of at least three enzymes to the lysosome.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	200	 On the other hand, this study shows that the capability to degrade exogenous arylsulfatase A is strikingly impaired in CLN6-defective cells.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Whereas the half-life of the newly synthesized ASA has been reported to be  > 40 days (51), the internalized human ASA is rapidly degraded (Ref.
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It is probable that the acidic pH-dependent octamerization cannot be completed by endocytosed ASA resulting in increased lysosomal instability (53).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Taking the endocytosed ASA as an index for the delayed degradation in CLN6-defective cells, the results indicate that either specific lysosomal proteases are absent and/or inactive or other lysosomal parameters such as pH or the presence of cofactors are affected.

0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The data suggest that the lysosomal acidification is impaired (54).
0.30761042.15010453.html.plaintext.txt	207	Lysosomal dysfunction attributed to a defective ER-resident membrane protein is not without precedent.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Background Cross-sectional genetic association studies are now widely employed to look for genes which confer longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Such studies are based on two assumptions; (a) initial relative allele frequencies in the different age cohorts are similar, and (b) the risk of mortality conferred by genotypes does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	6	Methods We explored the validity of these assumptions and reviewed 15 cross-sectional studies of common apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Higher relative 2 frequencies, and lower relative 4 allele frequencies were observed in elderly versus younger populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	8	 If assumptions (a) and (b) were correct the estimates for 2 and 4 alleles respectively versus 3 alleles would be 1.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, there was an association between relative 4 allele frequency in controls and APOE 4 effect (ss =  to 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In relation to assumption (a) there is substantial variation in relative APOE allele frequencies (4 to 21%), with considerable heterogeneity evident within geographically proximate populations, population admixture is likely to have resulted in changes in allele frequency over time, and assumption (b) APOE related causes of death are context specific and have changed considerably over the last 30 years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	12	Conclusion The validity of case-control type studies of the genetic basis of longevity based on the above assumptions is questionable, especially when considerable differences exist in allele frequency by population and when the genes in question interact with environmental factors, which vary by time and place.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	13	Keywords Longevity, ageing, genetic association, gene, APOE, methodology.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	14	Twin studies of longevity suggest that around 25% of the variation in lifespan in developed countries may be inherited.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	15	1 Understanding the heritability and consequently the biological processes involved in ageing and longevity is one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In the post genomic era and with large DNA resources becoming available within epidemiological studies, we are better placed than ever before to begin to unravel this complex problem.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	17	Epidemiological studies are widely used to look for genes conferring risk to common multifactorial diseases by comparing genotype distributions in cases and controls.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	18	2 More recently case-control designs have been used to identify differences in genotypes or allele frequencies of elderly compared with younger populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	19	3,4 Centenarians are typically studied, as these represent survivors, who may lack disease susceptibility genes and genes associated with premature mortality.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, specific methodological problems are inherent in studies comparing populations across time periods, which although alluded to in several reviews, have not been adequately addressed in study designs to date.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We argue that previous claims resulting from these studies may be flawed because they are based on the following assumptions: (a) initial relative allele frequencies in the different age groups are similar, and (b) the risk of mortality conferred by genotype does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	22	Further, due to secular trends in common disease incidence and changes in patterns of exposure to environmental risk factors such as smoking, genetic associations found in such studies are unlikely to contribute to a blueprint for future longevity, unless improvements are made to the methodology used.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	23	 An indication of the type of changes needed is provided in the concluding section of this paper.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	24	   Approaches to studying the genetics of ageing Top Abstract Approaches to studying the.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Centenarians are quite rare and linkage studies require a relatively large number of long-lived sib pairs together with DNA from sibs who died early to avoid acertainment bias.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Ideally DNA would also be available from more than one generation.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Genetic association studies are therefore more feasible, and are becoming widely used to look for genes which are important in longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	28	It is likely that many genes contribute to longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Candidate genes can be selected from either: (1) those genes implicated in general processes of cellular maintenance and repair, such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which is involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis; or (2) genes which confer an increased susceptibility to age-related diseases such as apolipoprotein E (APOE), a gene involved in lipoprotein metabolism and a proposed risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and Alzheimers disease.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	30	7,8 Since most genetic studies of longevity to date have been of the second type, this paper will focus on studies of disease-risk genes.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	31	Initial gene frequencies in the age cohorts represented in a longevity study are likely to be different and not necessarily represented by frequencies in the younger/control population Population stratification Genetic association studies have received a large amount of negative press recently, mainly due to the lack of repeatability of results and the opportunity for spurious results.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	32	2,9 to 12 One reason for these problems is population stratification and this phenomenon is pertinent to studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Whilst genuine differences between elderly cohorts and younger individuals may exist due to the role of genes in longevity, artefactual results of genetic effects may also arise due to variations in initial relative allele frequency between the two comparison groups, as a result of population admixture.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Although novel mutations are infrequent and diffuse slowly, because the interval between human generations is long, the gene pool of a given population can change considerably in a relatively short period as a result of geographical mobility, ethnic admixing, and selective mating.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	35	Migration If we take Britain as an example, over the last 100 years there has been mass emigration to the USA, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, coupled with an influx of individuals from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, the Caribbean and Africa.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	36	 More recently migration between countries in Europe has become common as a result of constitutional rights established within the European Union.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The scale of movement is substantial.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Of respondents to the decennial census in England, 13% of the population of England gave their ethnic origin as other than white British in the 2001, compared with 11% in 1991: an increase of 18% in 10 years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	39	13 Since migration among young adults tends to be for work or education, net inflows are often concentrated in cities, where genetic association studies may be based.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In England the highest levels of in-flow are in the South East.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	41	3% of residents classified themselves as white but not British or Irish in the 2001 census.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	42	13 Whilst genetic association studies usually collect data on ethnic group, they rarely distinguish between Caucasians and hence group together individuals with different countries and regions of origin.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	43	Migration within countries, so that individuals are better placed for work and health care may also have played a role in population mixing over the last century.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Movement between regions can result in changes in the genetic structure of regional populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Approximately 20% of individuals born in England, Scotland and Wales during 3 to 9 March 1958 resided in a different region in 1981 to that of their birth; this resulted in a reduction in interregional variability in ABO blood groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	46	15 Migration patterns differ widely between countries and time periods, so the scale of problem will depend on the study population.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	47	The risk of mortality conferred by genotypes does depend on the birth year of the cohort Secular trends in disease risk Migration from different gene pools may change genetic risk within a given population and influence mortality rates over time periods of the order of decades.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	48	 By addressing the first assumption we are in effect also addressing this dynamic.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Aside from changes in population genetic structure, environmental risk factors for disease have changed considerably during the last 100 years and two populations who were born only a few decades apart are likely to have been exposed to a very different pattern of stressors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	50	 For this reason such populations will have different susceptibilities to disease regardless of genotype.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Environmental risk factors are unlikely to change the population distribution of genetic variants; unless they offer strong selection against a particular allele in childhood and reproductive years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Therefore secular trends in genetic susceptibility to diseases of the elderly are not confounded by environment, but rather the environment acts as an effect modifier.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	53	Life expectancy doubled in the first half of the 20th century, largely due to a reduction in malnutrition and childhood infection.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which occur later in life, then became the major causes of death in developed countries.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	55	16 This shift in causes of mortality (the epidemiological transition) occurred over a relatively short period.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It has been suggested that the rise in CHD and cancer incidence in Western countries is a consequence of ageing populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	57	 However, the increase in rates of mortality from cancer which took place among men in Britain from 1921 to 1960 can be largely attributed to lung cancer, for which smoking is the main environmental cause.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	58	17 Levels of smoking in Britain reached a peak in the 1960s, followed by a steady decline, although approximately 30% of the adult population continue to smoke (Figure 1)16.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Similarly, national CHD mortality rates rose and fell during the past century.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Deaths from CHD reached a peak in many westernized countries in the 1970s and are now declining (Figure 2).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	61	18 Hence disease risks have changed over time, because levels of exposure to major environmental causes have changed.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	64	  Smoking, nutrition, physical activity, sexual behaviour, poverty, occupation, stress, education, social contacts, health care, pollution, war, and infectious disease are all factors which play a part in disease risk and longevity at the individual or societal level.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Patterns of availability and exposure to many of them have changed enormously, with secular socio-economic and cultural trends, over the last 100 years, as we have seen in the case of smoking.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Treatment for disease may also have an impact on mortality rates and will depend on the disease and the year that it is contracted.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	67	APOE and longevity Possibly the most extensively studied gene in relation to longevity is APOE.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The protein encoded by this gene is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, other receptors in the LDL receptor gene family, and cell matrix-associated heparin sulphate proteoglycans.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The gene plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, and has been shown to be associated with CHD risk.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	70	7,19 Three common polymorphic forms of APOE are known to exist: 2, 3, and 4.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The various APOE isoforms produced as a result of this polymorphism interact differently with specific lipoprotein receptors, ultimately altering circulating levels of cholesterol.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	72	 High LDL cholesterol levels are associated with APOE 4 and low levels with APOE 2, with APOE 3 levels being intermediate between the two.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	73	19 The APOE 4 allele has also been associated with an increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	74	8 Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, this association could be due to: (1) effects on amyloid-ss metabolism, (2) effects on neurons or glial cells, including neuronal survival and neurite extension, or (3) effects related to atherosclerosis, cerebral blood flow, or the blood to brain barrier.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	75	19 Since CHD and Alzheimer's disease are common disease of old age, APOE has become a candidate gene for studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Several studies comparing APOE genotypes in elderly versus younger populations have been carried out20 to 34 and an overview of the literature by Gerdes et al.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	77	28 found APOE 4 to be associated with premature death.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	78	To determine how inaccurate assumptions of initial APOE allele frequencies among elderly populations may influence the outcome of gene association studies, and whether any increased risk of mortality conferred by the APOE gene depends on year of birth, and to determine whether published studies have addressed these problems, we carried out a review of all studies comparing APOE allele frequencies in elderly versus younger populations.

0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   We have reviewed 15 cross-sectional studies of APOE polymorphisms and longevity to determine whether two key methodological assumptions have been addressed.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The studies provide direct evidence that size of the genetic effect of interest is sensitive to the relative allele frequency among controls, and that relative APOE 4 allele frequency exhibits wide variation between and within proximate populations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Our inference is that initial allele frequencies are likely to differ between the age cohorts from which the compared groups are drawn, and that assumption (a) is generally invalid.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Further, the biology and epidemiology of presumed APOE-related diseases, in particular the great variation in coronary death rates by time and place, provides indirect evidence that the mortality risk conferred by APOE genotype depends on interaction with environmental and behavioural risk factors over the life course.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The pattern of these exposures is closely related to the year of birth, and thus assumption (b) is likely to be invalid when gene to environment interaction is important, as is the case for APOE.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	143	Since genetic studies of common polygenic disease are a recent phenomenon it is impossible to determine directly whether initial allele frequencies in elderly individuals are represented by younger controls and similarly whether any risk of mortality associated with common genetic variants depends on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, in the case of APOE 4 it is clear that allele frequencies differ widely by population, even among neighbouring countries and between geographically separated populations within the same country, for example between Lapps and Finns.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	145	40 While migration patterns differ by country, there has been substantial internal and international migration in many countries within the last 100 years.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	146	41 These factors are likely to have produced differences in APOE allele frequency by age group within a given geographical area over recent decades.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Migration is particularly prevalent among younger populations and in large university cities,14 where most of these studies were carried out.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Whilst almost all studies showed that there was a deficit of APOE 4 alleles in elderly versus younger populations, heterogeneity in effect size remained, even when populations were stratified by region.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	149	We are able to make inferences based on the biology and epidemiology of APOE which suggests that assumption (b) is invalid, and that any longevity effect may be subject to modification over periods of years or decades, corresponding to the age difference between elderly and control groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	150	 APOE plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, therefore APOE genotype is one influence on the health effects of dietary fat intake.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	151	 APOE is associated with CHD risk, and this is one mechanism proposed to explain the association of APOE with longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In the last 30 years CHD mortality has decreased substantially in many countries (Figure 2).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Factors underlying this decrease include changes in diet, smoking, and treatments for CHD.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In the studies reviewed here the size of APOE 4 effect differed by population, providing further evidence that 4 effects are context dependant.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	155	There appeared to be an association between 4 allele frequency in controls and the effect of 4 on longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Sampling variation is an important potential explanation.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	157	 If by chance the estimated 4 prevalence is above the true prevalence, the former will tend to be high within the distribution and the effect size will tend to be extreme, due to regression to the mean.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, relative APOE 4 allele frequency is known to vary by population and the studies reviewed here are not anomalous in this respect.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Among Europeans relative APOE 4 frequencies exhibit a North to South cline.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	160	42 Accordingly, high relative APOE 4 allele frequencies were observed in studies with Northern European participants (15 to 21%) and low frequencies in Southern European studies (4 to 6%).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Furthermore, the Bayesian approach, which was used to calculate the association between control allele frequency and effect size, avoids the bias that can arise due to sampling error.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	162	It remains unclear whether sampling a younger control population produces valid estimates of initial allele frequencies in the corresponding elderly population.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Migration and population substructure may confound such studies.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	164	 If relative allele frequencies in control populations overestimate the initial relative allele frequencies in the elderly group a spurious estimate of the longevity effect will be obtained.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Migration is likely to change relative allele frequencies substantially when the source and recipient populations have very different allele frequencies.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Because changes in allele frequency in the short term are a function of the difference in frequency and migration rate, large differences can be seen in just one generation.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	167	43 Net immigration from regions with relatively high allele frequency will overestimate the decrease in 4 in the elderly relative to controls.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Conversely net immigration from areas with relatively low allele frequency will underestimate the difference.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	169	 For example in the Canadian study20 the relative APOE 4 allele frequency in the control group was 15.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	170	 If this represents the allele frequency in the elderly population at birth, 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	171	88) is a good estimate for the link between APOE 4 and longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, 19% of current Canadian residents were not born in Canada.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	173	41 If migrants came from countries with relatively high allele frequencies of 31% as reported among Lapps,44 migration would result in an overestimation of the real initial relative allele frequency 11.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	174	5% and the true 4 effect will be closer to the null 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Alternatively, if migrants came from countries or areas of low APOE 4 frequency (frequencies of 5% have been reported in Sardinians)45 the real initial frequency would have been higher at around 17.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	176	6% and the 4 effect will be around 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This simple example of international migration occurring within one generation does not take account of second generation migrants born in Canada or internal migration.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	178	 While it involves somewhat unrealistic assumptions about migration patterns, the example does offer some insight into how migration may influence results from genetic association studies of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	179	Only 3 out of the 15 studies matched on ethnicity and/or place of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The remaining studies assumed a static population and an identical gene pool for elderly and younger age groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A meta-analysis including only studies matching on origin or ethnicity, gave a result closer to the null, consistent with an artefactual explanation for the studies failing to take account of genetic heterogeneity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The remaining studies effectively assumed a static population and an identical gene pool for elderly and younger age groups.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	183	A further explanation for the apparent association between 4 prevalence and magnitude of 4 effect on longevity is that the impact is greater in populations with a higher underlying risk of CHD.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	184	 International comparisons suggest that APOE 4 allele frequency may explain some of the geographical variation in CHD risk.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	185	46 In Japan (a low CHD risk population) the ratio for relative 4 frequency in elderly versus younger populations is 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	186	58),25 whereas in Finland (a high CHD risk population) this ratio was found to be 0.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	187	23 The difference in CHD risk between Japan and Finland could be due to genetic susceptibility or environmental factors, but more likely a combination of both.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	188	 For example, in Northern Europe high APOE 4 relative allele frequencies have historically been accompanied by high levels of saturated fat intake.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	189	The influence of genetic variation on longevity is a priori an important research question.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Proponents of genetic epidemiology argue that  predicting multifactorial disease outcomes without consideration of epigenetic networks is increasingly seen as naive .
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	191	47 The implication for methodology is that the genetic dimension should be included in risk factor models of chronic disease, and, by extension, of longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The papers reviewed here focus on a single, genetic effect (the main effect of APOE on longevity) and represent early attempts to develop a genetic perspective in a field that has been dominated by environmental explanations.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	193	 For example, we know that environment, in the broad sense, including behavioural factors, is essential in understanding time trends in both CHD rates (Figure 2) and longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	194	 What is not known is whether single common genetic variations, such as the APOE polymorphism, are important factors that add to the explanation provided by conventional environmental risk factors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Studies of APOE and longevity reviewed here, which consistently showed an effect of 2 and 4 alleles on longevity, suggest that APOE may have a part to play.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	196	 However, analyses taking simultaneous account of genetic and environmental factors are needed to address this question.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	197	   Conclusion Top Abstract Approaches to studying the.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Methods Results Discussion Conclusion References   Our review leads us to the following conclusions in relation to the validity of assumptions (a) and (b).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	199	Assumption (a) Initial relative allele frequencies in the different age groups are similar This assumption may not hold when there is considerable variation in allele frequencies by population, and when migration has resulted in changes in population substructure.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	200	Assumption (b) The risk of mortality conferred by genotype does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This assumption may be invalid when mortality risk conferred by a genotype depends on interaction with environmental or behavioural risk factors, and when the pattern of exposure to such risk factors is closely related to year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	202	Whilst the studies reviewed here do provide some evidence of a link between APOE and longevity, the problem is that the size of effect depends on the population in question and probably also the time period that the study spans.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The link between the size of APOE effect and relative allele frequency seen in this review is likely to be a result of population differences in underlying disease susceptibility or changes in population structure over time and illustrates the impact of violating the above assumptions.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	204	Future case-control type studies could be improved by at least including comprehensive data on birth origins and exposure to potential confounding factors.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	205	 It is also possible to address concerns about population stratification in case-control studies, by carrying out genome analysis using methods such as genomic control and structured association.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	206	Cohort studies are not subject to the above assumptions, and hence are preferable to a cross-sectional design.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Participants can be selected and followed up over a given time period, during which they will be subject to the same age-related mortality rate.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The cohort studies carried out to date, which have looked at APOE and longevity, tend to have short follow-up periods (typically 5 years),49 to 56 hence they only provide a snapshot of overall survival.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These studies have reported mixed results, with some documenting null findings for APOE 4 and longevity,50,51 and others showing negative associations in subgroups only.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	210	54 to 56 To address this question adequately cohort studies, ideally birth cohorts, with a long follow-up are required.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	211	Cross-sectional studies of longevity assume that (a) relative allele frequencies are the same in different age cohorts, and (b) risk of mortality conferred by genotypes does not depend on year of birth.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Population admixture may result in considerable population changes in allele frequency over time, if allele frequencies differ substantially by population and if migration is high.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Mortality risk conferred by genotypes may differ if the gene in question interacts with environmental factors, which vary by time and place.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Studies of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 and longevity show that effect size estimates are associated with relative allele frequency in control populations, hence accurately predicting the impact of APOE on longevity depends on the validity of assumption (a).
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	215	 APOE is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and this is one mechanism proposed to explain the association of APOE with longevity.
0.31263503.15319409.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, CHD mortality has decreased mortaliy in the last 30 years, largely due to environmental and behavioural factors, hence the effect of APOE on longevity is context dependent.

0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here, we have used large scale cultures of apoE-expressing cells to purify apoE and prepare apoE containing reconstituted discoidal 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-L-phosphatidylcholine (POPC)-apoE particles.

0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	267	Background-- In the current study, we have focused on interactions of SR-BI with another potential ligand, the apolipoprotein E, which plays an important role for cholesterol homeostasis in the circulation and in the brain (6-9, 62).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Apolipoprotein E has remarkable structural similarities with apoA-I.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Both proteins contain 11-or 22-amino acid-long repeats that are organized in amphipathic  helices.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	270	 ApoE is a ligand for several cell receptors that serve to deliver cholesterol to cells (1-5).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	271	 ApoE may also play an important role in cholesterol efflux (6-9).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	272	 It was shown initially that apoE-containing lipoprotein particles with  electrophoretic mobility (Lp-E) are very effective in removing excess cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded cell cultures (6).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Plasma of mice lacking apoE has a reduced capacity to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	274	 However, this defect was corrected by selective expression of apoE in macrophages of the E/ mice (7).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	275	Cholesterol efflux may account for the protective role of apoE against atherosclerosis when it is expressed locally in the arterial wall by macrophages and endothelial cells (9-11).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Numerous studies have also implicated SR-BI in cholesterol efflux in vitro (28-30, 40).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	277	 It has been shown that transiently transfected cells and permanent cell lines overexpressing SR-BI promote net cholesterol efflux from cells to the HDL and rHDL cholesterol acceptors, but not to lipid-free apoA-I (28, 30).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In a variety of cell lines studied, the rate of cholesterol efflux correlates with the levels of SR-BI expression (30).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Potential interactions of apoE-containing lipoproteins with SR-BI could contribute to cholesterol ester delivery as well as to cholesterol efflux from cells that express SR-BI (63).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	280	Specific Binding of Reconstituted POPC-ApoE Particles to SR-BI-- Cells contain numerous apoE-recognizing receptors.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The most prominent are the LDL receptor (1, 2, 64), the LDL receptor-related protein (3), the VLDL receptor (5), and the apoE receptor-2 (4).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	282	 ldlA-7 do not have the LDL receptor (55, 56) but do have other apoE-recognizing receptors.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We observed high background binding, presumably due to the presence in these cells of other apoE-recognizing receptors.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	284	 To establish specific binding of apoE-containing lipoprotein particles to SR-BI, it was necessary to subtract the background binding of apoE to all these receptors in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that overexpresses the mouse SR-BI (ldlA [mSR-BI]).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Binding experiments using apoE4-established specific binding of POPC-apoE particles to ldlA [mSR-BI] occurs with Kd = 38  microg/ml and Bmax = 1700 ng/mg cell protein.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	286	To ensure that the specific values determined were valid, we measured the SR-BI-dependent binding using SR-BI receptor-blocking antibodies.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The specific binding curves and the binding parameters obtained by both procedures were essentially identical (Kd = 39  microg/ml and Bmax = 1800 ng/mg cell protein).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Similar binding parameters were obtained when the binding experiments were performed at 4  degrees C or when receptor binding was determined by ELISA.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	289	The binding of POPC-apoE4 was affected by a double mutation in SR-BI that eliminated most of the binding of HDL but not of LDL (28).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	290	 This observation suggests that there are similarities in the modes of binding of apoA-I containing native HDL and POPC-apoE4.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This conclusion is supported by competition experiments, suggesting that the recognition site for apoE on the SR-BI is more like that of the site that binds HDL than the site that binds LDL.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	292	Effects of ApoE Mutations on the Binding of POPC-ApoE Particles to SR-BI-- Binding of apoE to the LDL receptor is affected by mutations in residue 158 as well as by substitutions of charged residues in the 140-150 region of apoE (58-60).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In the current study, we examined the binding of three naturally occurring apoE forms (apoE2 [C112/C158], apoE3 [C112/R158], and apoE4 [R118/R158]) and several truncated apoE forms.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	294	 These truncations produced the amino-terminal segments of apoE, which extend to residues 259, 229, 202, or 165.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In previous studies we have used the cell lines expressing mouse SR-BI to determine the ligand specificity of the receptor using ligands containing human apoA-I (22).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The use of this heterologous system in the present study offers the advantage of the availability of the large number of mouse SR-BI and human apoE mutations, which are not available for the human SR-BI and the mouse apoE.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Although mouse and human apoE, as well as mouse and human SR-BI, have considerable sequence similarities, one can not exclude the possibility for species differences in the receptor ligand specificity due to the use of a heterologous system.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	298	 5, A-H and Table II the binding parameters of POPC-apoE particles to SR-BI are similar for the WT apoE and the truncated apoE forms (range of Kd 35-45  microg/ml).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The findings suggest that the amino-terminal region 1-165 of apoE contains the necessary determinants for its recognition by SR-BI and that Arg-158 is not critical for SR-BI receptor binding.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Similar studies with the LDL receptor have shown previously that Arg-158 as well as the carboxyl-terminal 171-183 apoE region are important for the binding of apoE-containing liposomes to the LDL receptor (60).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The receptor-binding properties of POPC-apoE particles are similar to those involving rHDL-apoA-I particles.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	302	 In the case of apoA-I, deletion of residues 186-243 did not affect binding of POPC-apoA-I to SR-BI (22).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The interactions of SR-BI with HDL and LDL are associated with selective lipid uptake (24-28, 31-34) as well as cholesterol efflux (28-30, 40).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Recent studies indicated that SR-BI is expressed by astrocytes but not by microglia in the brain (63), indicating that interactions of apoE-containing lipoproteins with SR-BI may contribute to brain cholesterol homeostasis.
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Reconstituted POPC/apoE particles containing apoE have the ability to deliver cholesteryl esters to cells (32).
0.30104497.11861652.html.plaintext.txt	306	 The role of apoE-containing lipoproteins in SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux and selective lipid uptake in the brain and the impact of apoE mutations on these processes remains to be determined.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	5	We have reported previously (Michikawa, M.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	6	 74, 1008-1016) that exogenously added recombinant human apolipoprotein E (apoE) promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, the molecular mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent promotion of cholesterol release remains undetermined.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In this study, we demonstrate that the cholesterol release is mediated by endogenously synthesized and secreted apoE isoforms and clarify the mechanism underlying this apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release using cultured astrocytes prepared from human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Cholesterol and phospholipids were released into the culture media, resulting in the generation of two types of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles; one was associated with apoE and the other with apoJ.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The amount of cholesterol released into the culture media from the apoE3-expressing astrocytes was ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	11	5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In contrast, the amount of apoE3 released in association with the HDL-like particles was similar to that of apoE4, and the sizes of the HDL-like particles released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were similar.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The molar ratios of cholesterol to apoE in the HDL fraction of the culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were 250  plus or minus  6.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These data indicate that apoE3 has an ability to generate similarly sized lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes can supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These findings provide a new insight into the issue concerning the putative alteration of apoE-related cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	16	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	17	Previous epidemiological studies show that an elevated serum cholesterol level is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 (1-3) and that statin therapy reduces the frequency of AD (4) and dementia (5).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The decreased levels of cellular cholesterol have been shown to reduce A production in vitro (6) and in vivo (7).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Previous studies have also shown the association of cholesterol accumulation with mature senile plaques (8) and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons (9).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Additionally, a recent study (10) has suggested that an increased cholesterol level in the membrane facilitates amyloid fibril formation through formation of GM1 ganglioside-bound A, a putative endogenous seed.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings suggest that increased cellular cholesterol levels induce high amyloid -protein (A) production and subsequent AD development.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	22	However, several studies (11-14) have shown opposing evidence indicating that cholesterol levels in serum, cell membranes of brains, and cerebrospinal fluid are decreased in AD patients compared with those in controls.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Previous studies have shown that increased dietary cholesterol levels reduce A secretion (15) and that increased cellular cholesterol levels inhibit the A-mediated cell toxicity (16, 17).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	24	 On the other hand, the effect of A on cellular cholesterol metabolism has also been investigated (18).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Our recent studies have shown that not monomeric but oligomeric A affects cholesterol metabolism (19) and eventually reduces cellular cholesterol levels (20).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, cholesterol deficiency has been shown to promote tau phosphorylation in vitro (21, 22) and in vivo (23).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings suggest that the involvement of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD is dualistic.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The elevated levels of cellular cholesterol contribute to AD development by elevating A secretion; however, the increasing amount of oligomerized A reduces cellular cholesterol levels, which in turn may promote the progression of AD pathologies.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	29	ApoE is one of the major apolipoproteins in the central nervous system regulating lipid metabolisms (24-27).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Astrocytes and microglia are known to synthesize apoE (28, 29), which generates HDL-like particles with cellular lipids in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and culture media (25, 26, 30, 31).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These apoE-lipid particles are assumed to supply cholesterol to neurons in an apoE receptor-mediated manner (32, 33).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Previously, we have reported (34) that exogenously added recombinant human apoE promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, the mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent cholesterol release mediated by apoE remains undetermined.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It is known that the majority of apoE in CSF and conditioned culture media is associated with lipids (31, 35), and that the characteristics of lipid particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein and those generated by endogenous apolipoprotein are different.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	35	 HDL-like particles generated by the addition of exogenous apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (36) and apoE (34) have a low amount of cholesterol, whereas HDL-like particles formed with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These lines of evidence led us to determine whether the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from cultured astrocytes is isoform-specific and, if it is the case, to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the isoform-dependent lipid release.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this study, we investigated the endogenous apoE-mediated cholesterol release from astrocytes isolated from human apoE3- and apoE4 knock-in mouse brains.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We found that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized HDL-like particles with less amount of apoE than apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings may provide the basis for studies to relate cholesterol with AD pathogenesis.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	251	Here, we demonstrate the apoE isoform-dependent lipid release from cultured astrocytes prepared from apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Although we have found no apoE isoform-dependent differences in size between the apoE3 and apoE4 lipid particles, nor in the total amount of released apoE between apoE3 and apoE4 astrocytes, the apoE3-specific enhancement of lipid release from the cells was observed.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These results indicate that apoE3 has a higher ability to generate apoE lipid particles with less numbers of apoE molecules per particle than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes, thereby supporting neuronal plasticity and promoting neuronal regeneration.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	254	It was reported that apolipoproteins with multiple -helix segments of 20-30 amino acid residues, in which hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues are aligned on opposite sides of the axis, induce cholesterol efflux from cells when added to the culture medium (44, 46-50).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	255	 ApoE is one of such apolipoproteins, and the effects of apoE on cholesterol release have been examined in various cell systems (51-54).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol release results in the generation of pre--HDL, which contains apolipoproteins, cellular cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Recent studies (31, 37) have demonstrated that HDL-like particles in association with exogenous or endogenous apoE are also generated in the cultured medium of the central nervous system cells such as astrocytes and neurons.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In addition, we have found that the addition of exogenous apoE promotes lipid release from the central nervous system cells generating HDL-like particles in an apoE isoform-dependent manner (34).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Consistent with our previous findings using exogenous apoE, the present study also shows that the amount of lipids released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes is apoE isoform-dependent, with the order of potency being apoE3  >  apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	260	 However, the mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent cholesterol release remains undetermined.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	261	Therefore, the next question to be addressed is what is the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We found that the amount of lipids released from apoE3-expressing astrocytes is ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	263	5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes, whereas the amount of apoE3 released is similar to that of apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	264	 One possible explanation to this may be that each particle contains equal amount of apoE proteins; however, particles containing apoE3 contain ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	265	5-fold greater amounts of lipids than those containing apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Another possible explanation may be that each particle contains equal amounts of lipids, but apoE3-containing particles contain lower numbers of apoE molecules than apoE4-containing particles.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This implies that apoE3 has the ability to form lipid particles with a lower number of apoE molecules than apoE4, and thus to generate ~2.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	268	5-fold greater numbers of apoE-lipid particles than apoE4 with the same number of apoE molecules.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Between these two possibilities, our experiment favors the latter because, as shown in Fig.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	270	 6 and Table II, the sizes of particles in both conditioned culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes are similar.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	271	The apoE isoform-dependent difference in the association of lipoprotein particles may be explained in terms of the mechanism underlying the apoE isoform-specific formation of apoE oligomers; apoE3 protein forms dimers, and apoE4 does not.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This difference may be because apoE3 has cysteine at position 112 of the N-terminal domain, whereas apoE4 has arginine at the same position.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Previous studies have shown that the number and the length of amphiphilic helices are responsible for determining the ability of a given apolipoprotein to promote lipid release (44, 49, 55).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Interestingly, human apoA-II is known to form disulfide-linked dimers and exhibit stronger ability to promote lipid release than monomeric apoA-II (44).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	275	 These lines of evidence allow us to postulate that the higher ability of apoE dimers than apoE monomers to promote lipid release may explain the greater amounts of lipids released in the conditioned culture media of apoE3-expressing astrocytes than apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Based on this assumption, we propose a model of the isoform-dependent association of apoE with lipid particles (Fig.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Consistent with our present results, previous studies have revealed the conformational adaptability of apoE the N-terminal domain as a function of lipid availability (56) or the presence of competitor apolipoproteins (for review see Ref.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In these studies, a model of two possible conformations of apoE on spherical lipid particles was proposed; at a high apoE concentration, the N-terminal domain is displaced from the lipid surface to form a helix bundle in a closed conformation, whereas at a low concentration on the surface, the four helix bundles of the N-terminal domain are in an open conformation, and all the helices are in contact with the lipid surface.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Based on these lines of evidence together with our findings that an apoE3-containing HDL-like particle contains approximately one-half the number of apoE molecules compared with an apoE4-containing particle, it may be possible that the apoE isoform-dependent conformational change occurs on the surface of lipid particles; the N-terminal domain of apoE3 is in an open conformation, whereas that of apoE4 is in closed helix bundle conformation.

0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	281	   Model of apoE lipid particles generated by apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The present data indicate that apoE3 has the ability to generate similarly sized apoE lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Based on these findings, we propose a model showing that one apoE4-containing lipid particle contains ~2-fold numbers of apoE molecules compared with an apoE3-containing lipid particle.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	284	Another possible explanation may be the preferential association of apoE isoforms with lipoproteins; apoE4 preferentially associates with very low density lipoprotein, whereas apoE3 associates with HDL.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This assumption is based on the facts that the N-terminal domain modulates the lipid-binding preference elicited by the C-terminal domain (58, 59) and that the interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains is responsible for this isoform preference (60, 61).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	286	 It has been suggested that in apoE4, the interaction of arginine 61 with glutamic acid 255 may stabilize an extended helical structure in the carboxyl terminus that is best accommodated on a less curved very low density lipoprotein surface, whereas this interaction does not exist in apoE3, which therefore lacks stability and has shorter helices and preference for HDL (61, 62).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Based on these lines of evidence, apoE3 may preferentially bind to an HDL particle with a lower number of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle, whereas apoE4 has less binding efficacy to an HDL particle, which requires higher numbers of apoE molecules to stabilize the particle.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Because the physical properties of apoE are assumed to influence its functions (i.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	289	 how it associates with lipid particles and stabilizes them), the apoE-isoform-dependent difference in the stability among the 22-kDa N-terminal fragments of apoE (63) may be involved in the isoform-dependent binding efficacy of apoE to HDL particles.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	290	Previous studies (48-50, 54) have demonstrated that various cells generate cholesterol-rich HDL-like particles with exogenous apolipoproteins.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	291	 However, this is not the case with astrocytes, because we and other researchers have found that generation of HDL by endogenous apoE and by exogenous apoE is differently regulated in cultured astrocytes; HDL-like particles that are generated with exogenous apolipoproteins have low amounts of cholesterol (34, 37), whereas HDL-like particles generated with endogenous apoE are cholesterol-rich (37).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In support of these findings, the present study has shown that apoE-lipid particles generated by the endogenously synthesized and released apoE are cholesterol-rich, compared with those generated by the addition of exogenous apoE (34).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Because the amount of apoE that is free from lipid particles in the cultured medium and CSF is below detection limit (see Ref.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	294	 4, a and b), these results suggest that under physiological conditions, cholesterol-rich lipid particles associated with endogenous apoE are the major cholesterol source for neurons in the central nervous system.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In this regard, it is of interest to note that apoE3-expressing astrocytes could supply more cholesterol in the form of apoE lipid particles to other cells including neurons with comparable levels of apoE secretion than apoE4-expressing astrocytes.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Under the steady-state conditions, the lipid metabolisms in the central nervous system appear similar between the brains of apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice; the concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol in the postnuclear supernatant, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum of the brain homogenate are similar (64).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	297	 However, under different conditions such as during recovery phases after brain injury and cell damage, endogenous apoE-mediated generation of HDL-like particles could play a critical role in cholesterol delivery to neurons, which are an essential material for axonal regeneration and synapse formation (65-68).
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Actually, previous studies (69, 70) have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury is the most robust environmental risk factor for development of AD.
0.28076172.12042316.html.plaintext.txt	299	 These lines of evidence may allow us to postulate that the apoE isoform dependence of the development of AD may be explained by the apoE isoform-dependent ability in the cholesterol supply to neurons after injury and cell damage, leading to neuroregeneration.

0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a major protein in lipid metabolism existing in three common isoforms: APOE2, -3 and -4.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The 4 allele of the APOE gene (APOE) coding for the APOE4 isoform is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and of Alzheimer s disease (AD).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Recently, several polymorphisms in the APOE regulatory region have been reported.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Some of these have been associated with AD and modified APOE allelic mRNA expression in AD brains.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we have investigated whether three of these promoter polymorphisms ( to 491AT,  to 427CT and  to 219GT) can also modify cardiovascular risk.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The hypothesis was tested in a large multicentre case to control study of MI, the ECTIM Study, on 567 cases and 678 controls.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Among the three APOE promoter polymorphisms tested, only the  to 219T allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of MI (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	10	003) and the effect was shown to be independent of the presence of the other mutations, including the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Moreover, the  to 219T allele greatly decreased the APOE plasma concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (P  <  0.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These data indicate that the  to 219GT polymorphism of the APOE regulatory region emerges as a new genetic susceptibility risk factor for MI and constitutes another common risk factor for both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (APOE) plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism as a ligand for various cell-surface receptors including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, the LDL-receptor related protein and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition to the APOE3 normal isoform encoded by the APOE 3 allele, mutations occurring in the APOE gene (APOE) at codons 158 (APOE 2 allele) and 112 (APOE 4 allele) determine the existence of two other isoforms: APOE2 and -4, respectively.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism has been shown to have an impact on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and APOE plasma levels.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Individuals carrying the APOE 4 allele had increased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and decreased APOE plasma levels (1,2).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Hence, the genetic impact of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism on total plasma cholesterol variance, estimated to be  > 8%, is thought to be one of the most powerful genetic components in the regulation of cholesterol levels at a population level (3,4).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	18	Given the strong impact of high total and LDL-cholesterol plasma levels on the occurrence of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and the effect of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism on these parameters, the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism is suspected to modulate CHD risk.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Indeed, several matched case to control studies have shown a modest but significant increased prevalence of the APOE 4 allele in CHD patients from various populations (1,5).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Nevertheless, even if APOE 4 appears as a significant genetic risk factor for CHD, individuals bearing APOE 4 do not inevitably develop this disorder.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This suggests that other genetic or environmental risk factors may interact with APOE 4 in determining CHD risk.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	22	In Alzheimer s disease (AD), the APOE 4 allele is also strongly associated with an increased risk of developing the disease but, as in CHD, individuals bearing APOE 4 do not necessarily develop dementia (6).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It was lately proposed that together with the qualitative modification of the APOE structure due to the APOE 4 allele, quantitative variations of APOE mRNA expression played a major role in risk determination (7).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Reinforcing this hypothesis, polymorphisms in the APOE regulatory region have been recently described at positions  to 491AT,  to 427TC and  to 219GT (also called Th1/E47cs), and associated with the risk of developing AD (8,9).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In particular, the  to 219GT polymorphism was shown to have functional activity in vitro (10) and to significantly modify APOE allelic mRNA expression levels in human AD brain tissue (11).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	26	Since the APOE locus has been implicated in the genetic predisposition to myocardial infarction (MI), we tested in a large multicentre case to control study of MI whether the  to 491AT,  to 427TC and  to 219GT polymorphisms, in addition to the effect of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism, may modify cardiovascular risk.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	27	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Allelic and genotypic distributions were in Hardy to Weinberg equilibrium for all the polymorphisms characterized (Table 1).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A statistically significant difference in distribution between cases and controls was detected for the  to 219GT and APOE 2/3/4 polymorphisms, the APOE 4 and  to 219T alleles being more frequent in cases than controls (Table 1).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	29	 As previously described in the ECTIM Study, the relative risk of MI, approximated by the odds ratio (OR), in men carrying the APOE 4 allele was significantly increased (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	30	008) compared with non-carriers.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Furthermore, in men carrying the  to 219T allele, the risk of developing MI was also significantly increased (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	32	 After adjustment of covariates, the increased relative risks associated with the APOE 4 allele and the  to 219T allele remained significant (Table 2).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Impact of the  to 219GT and 2/3/4 polymorphisms [OR (95% CI)] on the occurrence of myocardial infarction   The previously described strong linkage disequilibrium for the four polymorphisms (8,9,11) was verified in the present study (Table 3).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Therefore, we estimated the effect of each polymorphism on MI risk independently of the others by multivariate regression analysis (Table 2).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These data indicated that the risk associated with the presence of the APOE 4 and  to 219T alleles was borderline significant (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In order to complete the multiple regression approach, we stratified our sample into those with or without the 4 allele (Table 2).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this case, the  to 219T allele was associated with a significant increased risk of MI in the 4 to  population (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	38	02) and with a similar trend in the 4+ population, the lack of significance being likely due to the sample size (OR = 1.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Pairwise linkage disequilibrium in the APOE locus   Assuming that the presence of both the APOE 4 and  to 219T alleles would be a powerful risk factor for early-onset MI, we compared the estimated frequencies of the APOE 2/3/4 to 219GT haplotypes between cases aged 55 years or less at the date of onset and cases aged  > 55 years (median age of onset).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The frequency of the APOE 4/ to 219T haplotype was significantly higher in younger than in older cases (14.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Conversely, frequencies of the other haplotypes did not statistically differ between young and old cases.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Moreover, in APOE 44 homozygous cases, the mean age of the ten  to 219TT bearers was 49.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	43	6 years for the eight  to 219TT non-bearers (non-parametric Wilcoxon test: P  <  0.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	44	Given the key role of APOE in circulating lipid metabolism, the major impact of plasma lipids on cardiovascular disease and the effect of the  to 219GT polymorphism on MI risk, we tested the impact of the  to 219GT polymorphism on various lipid and lipoprotein plasma concentrations in non-treated controls participating in the study.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The  to 219GT polymorphism was not associated with significant differences in lipid and lipoprotein plasma levels.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, we identified a highly significant difference in plasma APOE concentrations according to the  to 219GT genotype (P  <  0.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	47	0001), plasma APOE concentrations appearing to be allele dose dependent (Table 4).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The two other promoter polymorphisms had no effect on APOE plasma concentrations (data not shown).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Since the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism strongly determined the APOE concentrations (1), the impact of the  to 219GT polymorphism on plasma APOE was reanalysed after adjustment of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism and the impact of the  to 219T allele remained significant (P  <  0.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Furthermore, when the ECTIM control group was stratified according to APOE genotypes, similar trends of the  to 219GT polymorphism s effect on APOE plasma concentrations were observed in the 33, 34 and 44 subgroups (Table 4).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In a similar way, the  to 219T allele was only associated with decreased APOE plasma concentrations in the case group, mainly due to the TT genotype (GG: 5.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	52	 After adjustment on the 2/3/4 polymorphisms, the statistical significance remains borderline (P  <  0.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Effect of the  to 219GT genotypes on lipid and APOE plasma concentrations in controls and effect of the  to 219GT polymorphism on APOE plasma concentrations by subgroups of 2/3/4 genotypes      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In the ECTIM Study, our data demonstrate that the  to 219GT polymorphism, located in the APOE promoting sequence, significantly modulates the risk of MI, independently of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Given the role of APOE in plasma lipid metabolism, and in order to determine the mechanism by which the  to 219GT polymorphism may modify the risk of MI, we tested the impact of the polymorphism on the various lipid and the lipoprotein plasma concentrations.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Despite a strong effect of the mutation on APOE plasma concentrations, no major effect on lipids could be observed, especially for total cholesterol and atherogenic LDL subfraction.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, we were able to associate the  to 219T allele with lower APOE plasma concentrations, this observation being in agreement with the previously reported lower expression of APOE associated with the presence of the  to 219T allele in HepG2 transfected cells (10).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Other mutations affecting the APOE promoter (the  to 491AT and  to 427TC polymorphisms) did not show any effect on lipid levels or the risk of MI.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	58	A major question concerns the mechanism by which the  to 219GT polymorphism may influence the cardiovascular risk.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Indeed, the contribution of the polymorphism to MI risk is unlikely to be mediated though a modulation of plasma lipoprotein metabolism, as has been suggested to explain the functionality of the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Using HepG2 hepatoma cells as a model, Bohnet et al.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	61	 (12) have demonstrated that the APOE concentrations in VLDL, in addition to the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism, help to determine VLDL affinity for the APOE-binding receptors, and probably subsequent variations in plasma total and LDL-cholesterol levels.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In the present study, plasma VLDL-cholesterol levels were highly associated with the APOE 2/3/4 polymorphism confirming that circulating VLDL-cholesterol is strongly determined by the affinity of APOE isoforms carried by VLDL lipoproteins (1).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, VLDL-cholesterol concentrations were not associated with variations at the  to 219GT locus, even after stratification on APOE 2/3/4 genotypes.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Since the  to 219GT polymorphism has been shown to influence APOE expression, these data suggest that APOE concentrations in VLDL are unaffected by hepatic APOE expression.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	65	 As a consequence, the  to 219GT polymorphism is unlikely to modulate VLDL binding affinity for the receptors, and subsequent plasma lipid and lipoprotein variations.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Indeed, in our study the  to 219GT polymorphism was not associated with significant variation in lipid and lipoprotein plasma levels.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	67	Since the deleterious impact of the  to 219T allele on MI cannot be explained by a major effect on circulating lipids, it may be mediated by more subtle and local mechanisms, involved, for instance, in the course of atherosclerotic plaque formation.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Interestingly, abundant APOE, mainly produced by macrophages, is found in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that macrophage-derived APOE may be anti-atherogenic (13,14).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Indeed, by studying the effect of macrophage-specific expression of human apoE in apoE null mice, Bellosta et al.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	70	 (15) showed that this specific apoE expression reduced atherosclerotic lesion development compared with control littermates matched for cholesterol level and lipoprotein profile.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how macrophage-derived APOE may be anti-atherogenic, for instance: (i) ApoE may protect against oxidative stress and isoform-specific antioxidant activities have been described, the APOE2 isoform being the most effective agent and the APOE4 isoform being the lesser (16); and (ii) macrophage APOE may also modulate cholesterol balance in the arterial wall in an isoform-dependent manner (17,18), APOE2/APOE2 macro- phages secreting cholesterol more efficiently than APOE3/APOE3 or APOE4/APOE4 cells (19).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	72	Together, these data suggest that genetically determined quantitative limitations of APOE expression may have major effects in humans, especially when they are stressed by an atherogenic diet, at least by regulating antioxidant activities and cholesterol balance within the arterial wall.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In this context, the increased risk of MI and decreased APOE plasma concentrations associated with the  to 219T allele may suggest that, in addition to the deleterious effect of the APOE 4 allele, the basal ability of cells to synthesize and secrete APOE may be of particular relevance, irrespective, to some extent, of the isoform.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	74	 With this in mind, by calculating the mean age of APOE 44 homozygotes cases according to the  to 219GT status, we have suggested that  to 219TT homozygotes may be at higher risk of MI.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	75	In conclusion, by studying the impact of mutations affecting the APOE promoter on cardiovascular disease risk, we reinforced the probability of functionality of the  to 219GT polymorphism while other mutations did not seem to exert major effects.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The  to 219GT polymorphism should significantly influence the level of synthesis of APOE which may, in addition to the specific properties of the various isoforms, be a critical determinant of physiological and pathological mechanisms involved in both cardiovascular and neuro- degenerative disorders relating to the APOE locus.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	77	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Population studied This work was carried out in a large multicentre case to control study, the ECTIM Study (Etude Cas-Temoins de l Infarctus du Myocarde) based on four centres participating in the WHO-MONICA Project: Lille and its suburbs, Strasbourg and the region of Bas-Rhin, Toulouse and the region of Haute-Garonne, in France, and Belfast and its surroundings in Northern Ireland (20).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	78	 A total population of 587 men aged 25 to 64 years surviving a definite MI was recruited and compared with a random sample of 727 age-matched male controls from the same geographical areas.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	79	Blood sampling and lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein analyses Blood sampling and lipid, apolipoprotein and lipoprotein measurements were performed according to the methods described elsewhere (20).

0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	81	DNA extraction and genetic analysis Genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplifications were performed as previously described (8,9).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The  to 491AT,  to 427TC,  to 219GT and APOE 2/3/4 genotypes could be obtained for 1245 subjects (567 cases versus 678 controls).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	83	 APOE 2/3/4 was deduced from phenotyping analysis (1).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	84	 For each other polymorphism, mutations were detected by adequate enzymatic digestion followed by an electrophoretic step in ethidium bromide-stained agarose or polyacrylamide gels.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	85	Statistical analysis The data were analysed using the SAS statistical software release 6.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Genotype frequencies were compared in cases and controls with multivariate logistic regression analysis including dummy variables to take populations and population to genotype interactions into account.
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Genotypes were coded according to the hypothesis tested (dose-dependent model as observed in Table 1).
0.43928444.10587578.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Extended haplotype frequencies of the four markers were estimated on collapsed data using the myriad algorithm described by McLean and Morton (21), using a computer program by Cox et al.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received May 21, 1998; Revised and Accepted August 18, 1998.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	3	While the [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) is widely accepted as a major genetic risk factor for the late onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence points to variations in ApoE levels as another important factor.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have previously reported that a common variant in the regulatory region of APOE (-491A) is associated with risk for late onset AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In this report we analyze the association of another APOE promoter polymorphism (-427T/C) with AD in two case-control clinical samples and demonstrate a correlation between APOE promoter transcriptional activity and risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The association studies show that the allelic variant (-427C) and the haplotype [-491A-427C] of the APOE promoter are associated with increased risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Study of the transcriptional activity of the common haplotypes defined by combination of the -491 and -427 alleles indicated that the risk for late onset AD positively correlates with transcriptional activity of the APOE gene, suggesting that increases in the local expression of ApoE could be responsible for the association of APOE promoter polymorphism with AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	8	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, exists in both familial and sporadic forms.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Genetic studies have led to the identification of three genes, [beta]-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1), presenilin-1 (2) and presenilin-2 (3), which, when mutated, can cause autosomal dominant forms of familial AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, mutations in these three genes are responsible for only a small fraction of AD cases, while the vast majority of patients with AD presents with a late age at onset and shows non-Mendelian inheritance.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The absence of Mendelian inheritance indicates that late onset AD is a complex disease in which genetic and non-genetic factors are likely to be interacting.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The [epsis]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; ApoE, protein) has been associated with an increased risk of developing AD (4).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, many AD cases have no APOE [epsis]4 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus it is likely that there are additional AD risk factors, both genetic and environmental, still to be identified.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	15	We have screened for genetic variability in the proximal promoter region of APOE (nt -1017 to +406) and observed three new polymorphic sites (-491, -427 and -219) (5) and a previously described one (+113) (6) within this region.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We have recently reported that one of these variants (-491A) is associated with risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We now report that the allelic variant -427C of the APOE promoter is also associated with AD, whereas we found no significant association of -219 and +113 polymorphisms with risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Results from others have suggested that the -219 polymorphism acts as a modifier of ApoE4- associated risk (8).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Study of the transcriptional activity of the haplotypes defined by combination of the -491 and -427 alleles indicates that the risk for late onset AD correlates with transcriptional activity of the APOE gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	20	During our screening of the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene a novel polymorphic site (-427T/C) was identified (5).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The possible genetic association of this polymorphism with risk for AD was studied in a Spanish case-control sample, in which we had previously observed an association between the polymorphism at position -491 of the APOE promoter and risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	22	The genotype and allele distributions for the -427T/C polymorphism are shown in Table 1.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The TC genotype and the C allele were more frequent, although differences did not achieved statistical significance, in the AD group than in the controls, suggesting that they were associated with an increased risk for AD [odds ratio (OR) 1.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	30	In order to determine whether the variation in risk for AD associated with the -427T/C polymorphism was independent of the risk conferred by ApoE4, the sample was stratified on the basis of the absence or presence of the ApoE4 allele (Table 1).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	31	 No difference in the frequency of the -427C allele or the -427TC genotype was observed between the AD patients and controls bearing one or two ApoE4 alleles, but the -427C allele was clearly associated with increased risk for AD in individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles (OR 3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Similarly, the -427TC genotype was associated with a >3-fold increase in risk for AD in the same subpopulation (OR 3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	33	45), indicating that the variation in risk for AD conferred by the -427T/C polymorphism is only apparent in individuals not carrying any ApoE4 allele.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The same trend was observed in the US group of individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles (OR 1.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	35	01 for the TC genotype), although the differences in allelic frequencies did not achieve statistical significance in this population.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	36	Since the -427T/C and -491A/T polymorphisms are located very close to each other within the proximal 5[prime]-flanking region of the APOE gene and both of them appeared to be associated with risk for developing AD, we analyzed their effect on AD risk when combined into haplotypes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We first analyzed the [-491-427] haplotype distribution in both the Spanish and US samples.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A combined digestion of an APOE fragment spanning nt -512 to -285 with DraI and AluI was performed, which allowed identification of the four haplotypes and the 10 genotypes defined by the combination of the -491 and -427 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Haplotype [A-T] [-491-427] was the most common, followed by [T-T] and [A-C].
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	40	 No subjects with the T-C haplotype were found in either sample.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The distribution of these haplotypes in genotypes was close to that expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ([chi]2 test, P > 0.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, no statistically significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium between these polymorphisms was detected ([chi]2 test, P = 0.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The most frequent genotype was [A-T]/[A-T], followed by [A-T]/[T-T] and [A-T]/[A-C]; these three genotypes accounted for >92% of both the Spanish and St Louis control populations.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The frequency of genotypes [T-T]/[T-T] and [A-C]/[T-T] was  < 5% and the frequencies of the other genotypes ranged from 0 to 2%.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The distribution of the major haplotypes and genotypes in the Spanish and St Louis samples is shown in Table 2.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	46	Since our previous study had revealed differences in transcription associated with the -491 polymorphism (5,7), we then examined the functional characteristics of the major [-491-427] haplotypes present in our populations.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The APOE proximal promoter activity of the three haplotypes ([T-T], [A-T] and [A-C]) was measured in U87 human astrocytoma cells using the same luciferase-based transient transfection system employed in our previous studies (5,7,19).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	48	 As shown in Figure 1, transcriptional activity of haplotypes [A-T] and [A-C] were increased by 30 and 100%, respectively, over that of haplotype [T-T], suggesting that the presence of the alleles conferring increased risk for AD (-491A and -427C) is associated with increased constitutive levels of APOE promoter activity in human astrocytoma cells.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The three haplotypes [T-T], [A-T] and [A-C] were thus named minus (-), even (x) and plus (+), respectively, according to their transcriptional activity.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Additional information was obtained using oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the -491 and -427 allelic forms in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, with freshly prepared nuclear extracts from U87 cells.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	51	 As shown in Figure 2, one of the three specific band shifts detected by the 427T probe (arrows) was not detected by the 427C probe, suggesting that the T->C substitution hinders binding of the probe to a nuclear protein.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This finding is in agreement with the data obtained in our previous work using the 491 probes (7) and strongly suggests that differential transcriptional activities of the three [-491-427] haplotypes encountered in astrocytoma cells are a consequence of differential binding to nuclear proteins present in these cells.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	66	 A strong association between AD risk and promoter activity of the three predominant genotypes (x-, xx and x+) was observed in the Spanish non-ApoE4 individuals; taking as reference the x- individuals, the risk for AD was found to increase 6- and 18-fold in xx and x+ individuals, respectively.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Statistical significance of these data was evaluated by a logistic regression model.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Although the association was less impressive than that encountered in the Spanish population, a similar dependence of OR for developing AD and promoter activity of the three predominant genotypes was detected in the non-E4 subpopulation (Table 3).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The logistic regression analysis indicated a highly statistically significant association between AD risk and promoter activity (P  <  10-10), with ORs of 1.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	78	In this paper we report an association between polymorphisms in the proximal region of the APOE promoter and risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	79	 We have previously reported association of homozygosity for the -491A allele with risk for AD (7).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Here we show that the -427C allele is also associated with risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Furthermore, combination of these two alleles into the [-491A-427C] haplotype generates a high risk for AD, in particular in the Spanish population, in individuals bearing no ApoE4 alleles.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The same effect is observed in the St Louis sample, although the relative risk was lower than in the Spanish sample.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The difference in relative risk is most probably attributable to differences in the frequencies of APOE promoter haplotypes in the two control populations, since the two AD samples show very similar frequencies of promoter haplotypes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	84	 It is well documented that population-based differences in ApoE4 allele frequency (9,10) give rise to population differences in relative risk for AD associated with this allele.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Consistently, in our samples the OR associated with ApoE4 in the Spanish population (8.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	86	3) was more than double that in the St Louis sample (3.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Based on these data, we anticipate that there will be wide variation in the relative risk for AD associated with the APOE promoter polymorphism in different populations, as has already been noted for the ApoE4 allele (11).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Dividing the sample on the basis of the presence or absence of ApoE4 revealed that the promoter polymorphisms and ApoE4 are independent risk factors.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Indeed, the risk due to the promoter polymorphism was most prominent in individuals without ApoE4 alleles.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Regulation of APOE expression has been investigated thoroughly in hepatoma cells, where it has been shown that the elements required for efficient expression are located in the 5[prime] proximal region and in the first intron (16-18).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	97	 More recently, we have demonstrated that this region also drives efficient expression of APOE in astrocytoma cells (19).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The data presented in this report strongly suggest that allelic polymorphism in the transcriptional regulatory region of APOE may contribute to differences in the levels of ApoE synthesis by astrocytes.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Specifically, our data indicate that the single base substitutions corresponding to the -491 and -427 APOE polymorphic sites produce differences in transcriptional activity of the APOE promoter due to differential binding of nuclear proteins.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	103	 There is increasing evidence suggesting that increased levels of ApoE are associated with AD pathogenesis.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Several studies have reported that ApoE levels are elevated in the brain and in plasma from AD patients (23-25).

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Recent studies have also demonstrated that the level of ApoE expression can modify both the cytotoxic effects of ApoE and the propensity of A[beta] to deposit in the murine brain.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	107	 ApoE at concentrations found in the cerebrospinal fluid protects neuronal cells from A[beta] peptides, while higher ApoE concentrations could lead to neuronal cell death (27).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Crossing APOE knockout mice with mice overexpressing a human mutant APP gene indicates that A[beta] deposition correlates positively with ApoE dose and suggests that ApoE may facilitate A[beta] peptide deposition in vivo (28).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	109	Despite the evidence implicating ApoE4 as the single most important genetic determinant of susceptibility to late onset AD, its pathogenic role is not well understood.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The amino acid substitutions associated with the E2, E3 and E4 ApoE isoforms lead to differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of ApoE that are likely to alter the functional properties of the molecule.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Several potential mechanisms of action of ApoE4 on AD risk have been proposed, based on the ApoE isoform-specific differences observed in several assays developed in brain cells (28-35).
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, to date there is no adequate explanation for the variation in risk for AD associated with the different ApoE isoforms.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	113	Based upon data presented here and elsewhere we suggest that there are two independent mechanisms by which AD risk can be modified in the APOE gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The first involves variants in the coding region that alter the functional properties of the ApoE molecule, while the second involves promoter region variants that result in quantitative differences in ApoE expression.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	115	 These two factors are associated with AD risk independently, i.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	116	 each one can produce risk by itself, but may interact with each other resulting in an overall risk for individuals bearing both ApoE4 and high expressing APOE promoter forms that would depend on the relative contribution of each of these two risk factors.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	117	In summary, our data strongly suggest that risk for AD associated with APOE promoter polymorphisms directly correlates with the transcriptional activity of the gene.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Further, we speculate that increases in the local expression of ApoE, due to the APOE promoter polymorphisms, could lead to enhanced deposition of A[beta] peptide in the brain, thus explaining the increased risk for AD.
0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	119	 If this is correct, then drugs that either control ApoE synthesis or inhibit A[beta] production or deposition may be useful in the treatment of AD.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	121	The test sample consisted of 132 healthy controls (age of onset 72  plus or minus  7 years, mean  plus or minus  SD) and 110 late onset sporadic AD cases (68  plus or minus  5 years) from the Madrid region of Spain, recruited from the Neurology Service of the Hospital La Paz of Madrid.

0.42286012.9811931.html.plaintext.txt	128	 A nested PCR was used because we had difficulty in reliably amplifying the -512 to -285 fragment directly from genomic DNA.

0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	5	We have investigated the recycling of apoE in livers of apoE/ mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow (apoE+/+  apoE/), a model in which circulating apoE is derived exclusively from macrophages.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Nascent Golgi lipoproteins were recovered from livers of apoE+/+  apoE/ mice 8 weeks after transplantation.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	7	 ApoE was identified with nascent d  <  1.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	8	210 g/ml lipoproteins at a level ~6% that of nascent lipoproteins from C57BL/6 mice.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Hepatocytes from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice were isolated and cultured in media free of exogenous apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	10	 ApoE was found in the media primarily on the d  <  1.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	11	006 g/ml fraction, indicating a resecretion of internalized apoprotein.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Secretion of apoE from C57BL/6 hepatocytes was consistent with constitutive production, whereas the majority of apoE secreted from apoE+/+  apoE/ hepatocytes was recovered in the last 24 h of culture.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This suggests that release may be triggered by accumulation of an acceptor, such as very low density lipoproteins, in the media.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In agreement with the in vivo data, total recovery of apoE from apoE+/+  apoE/ hepatocytes was ~6% that of the apoE recovered from C57BL/6 hepatocytes.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Since plasma apoE levels in the transplanted mice are ~10% of control levels, the findings indicate that up to 60% of the internalized apoE may be reutilized under physiologic conditions.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These studies provide definitive evidence for the sparing of apoE and its routing through the secretory pathway and demonstrate that internalized apoE can be resecreted in a quantitatively significant fashion.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	17	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	18	Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is unique among the plasma lipoprotein apoproteins because of its many different functions in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Its role as a ligand for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins is well established (1-3).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Additionally, apoE interacts with lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase to modulate triglyceride hydrolysis (4, 5).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Even within the cell, apoE is known to serve biologically relevant roles.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Studies suggest that apoE directs the intracellular routing of internalized remnant lipoproteins, with smaller -migrating very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles routed to the perinuclear region of the mouse macrophage in a fashion similar to low density lipoproteins (LDL), whereas larger -VLDL remain closer to the plasma membrane (6, 7).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	23	 (8) report that apoE modulates intracellular lipid metabolism, in particular the hydrolysis and utilization of triglyceride.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	24	 ApoE is also linked to and may be a regulator of cholesterol efflux from macrophages (9-11), an effect with significant repercussions on vascular health and the process of atherogenesis.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Finally, increasing evidence points to a role for apoE in hepatic lipoprotein assembly and the incorporation of triglycerides into newly forming VLDL (12-14).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Due to its critical role in a number of biological processes within the cell, apoE may follow unique pathways of secretion and internalization that maximize its impact on cellular functions.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	27	Wong (15) was among the first to suggest that apoE may be recirculated.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	28	 He reported that 62-66% of the intrahepatic apoE, compared with 7-10% of the intrahepatic apoB, was derived from plasma.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This suggested that internalized apoE may not undergo complete degradation and may therefore follow a unique intracellular routing pathway.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We previously reported that a portion of the apoE component of internalized lipoproteins is spared degradation and routed through the Golgi apparatus (16).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	31	 After injection of radioiodinated mouse d  <  1.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	32	019 g/ml lipoproteins into C57BL/6 mice, radioactivity found in the Golgi apparatus-rich fractions from livers of the recipient mice was almost exclusively due to apoE, although the injected lipoproteins had less than 10% of their label associated with apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The ratio of apoE/apoB48 in the Golgi fraction increased 10-fold relative to serum, and only traces of apoB100 were detected.

0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Quantitatively, similar results were obtained when labeled VLDL was injected into mice deficient in either apoE or the LDL receptor, indicating that the phenomenon of apoE recycling is not influenced by the production of endogenous apoE and is not dependent on the presence of LDL receptors.

0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	208	The present study explored the recycling of apoE in the livers of apoE/ mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In this model all of the apoE derives from macrophages, and plasma apoE levels are at steady state, with the production of apoE by macrophages and its internalization and potential resecretion by the liver at equilibrium.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Therefore any apoE appearing in the secretory pathway in the liver or recovered in the media of hepatocytes isolated from these mice is derived from internalized extrahepatic apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Using the BMT model we have demonstrated the presence of apoE within nascent hepatic Golgi lipoproteins, providing strong evidence that at least a portion of internalized extrahepatic apoE is routed to the secretory pathway.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Additional studies using primary hepatocytes from the apoE+/+  apoE/ mice not only confirmed the routing of internalized apoE to the secretory pathway but also demonstrated the resecretion of internalized apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	213	 These results coupled with our earlier in vivo studies (16) provide overwhelming support for the hypothesis that a portion of apoE that is internalized with lipoproteins is not completely degraded but is in fact resecreted.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The physiologic relevance of the reutilization and recycling of apoE is unknown.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Our studies show that introduction of apoE via BMT does not affect hepatic triglyceride production rates, but the lack of an effect may simply reflect suboptimal concentrations of intracellular recycling apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Alternatively, the functional role of recycling apoE may be linked to effects that are independent from or more subtle than the bulk secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	217	Our finding of apoE with nascent lipoproteins in Golgi apparatus-rich fractions from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice in the present study (Fig.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	218	 1) provides definitive evidence for the routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway under physiologic conditions.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The finding of apoE within the Golgi fractions was not due to contamination of the preparations with elements of the endocytic compartment, as studies in our laboratory have established the purity of the hepatic Golgi fractions by this technique (18).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Contamination of our fractions with Golgi from Kupffer cells, a possible source of apoE, is not expected to play a role here since engraftment of Kupffer cells in liver is less than 20% at 8 weeks and only ~35% of total macrophages 6 months after transplantation (23).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In addition, it is unlikely that Kupffer cell Golgi apparatus isolates with hepatocyte Golgi apparatus, as Kupffer cells do not produce triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that contribute to the buoyancy of the hepatocyte-derived organelle (24).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Therefore the appearance of apoE in the hepatic Golgi fractions of the apoE+/+  apoE/ mice represents routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	223	The resecretion of apoE from primary cultures of hepatocytes from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice provided additional evidence for apoE recycling.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In contrast to the constitutive pattern of secretion of apoE from hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice, the majority of apoE recovered in the media of hepatocytes from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice was released in the last 24 h (Fig.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This release was not caused by cell death, as the cells from both control and transplanted animals appeared healthy after the 45-h culture period.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	226	 (25), studying the retroendocytosis of apoE from HepG2 cells, report that the presence of high density lipoproteins or lipid emulsion in the media resulted in a significantly increased rate of secretion of intact protein compared with media with no acceptor.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	227	 (26) also report that high density lipoprotein seemed to serve as an extracellular acceptor for the resecretion of apoE from fibroblasts.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Although in our experiments the media did not contain an exogenous acceptor to stimulate the release of apoE, the hepatocytes do secrete apoE-deficient VLDL (Fig.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	229	 1), which may serve as acceptor for and stimulator of apoE release from hepatocytes.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	230	 A threshold concentration of apoE-deficient VLDL, attainable only during the 24-h culture period, may be required to trigger the release of apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In this regard, it is important to note that apoE recovered in the media is found mainly with the d  <  1.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	232	Although Kupffer cells in our hepatocyte cultures may contribute to the apoE recovered in the media, our data suggest that their contribution is minimal.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Immunocytochemical staining using antibody to MOMA-2, an established marker for macrophages, indicates that less than 1-2% of the cells in culture is of macrophage origin.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	234	 (27) report that Kupffer cells in rat liver account for less than 1% (0.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	235	7%) of the total liver apoE mRNA and that the level of apoE mRNA in Kupffer cells was approximately one-third that of hepatocytes.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The total recovery of apoE in the media of the hepatocytes from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice is ~5-6% of apoE recovered in the media from C57BL/6 hepatocytes.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Assuming the secretion of apoE is proportional to the apoE mRNA content of the Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, the number of Kupffer cells in our preparation cannot account for the mass of apoE found in the media.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In addition, the kinetics of appearance of apoE in the media is not consistent with what might be predicted for a constitutively secreted apoprotein as observed in the secretion of apoE from C57BL/6 hepatocytes, and as noted above, the engraftment of liver Kupffer cells in mice after BMT is less than 20% of total tissue macrophages 8 weeks after transplantation (23).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Finally and perhaps most importantly, newly synthesized apoE could not be detected in hepatocyte cultures from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice (Fig.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Therefore, based on the mass of apoE found in the media, the number of cells identified as Kupffer cells using immunocytochemistry, the secretion kinetics, the kinetics of engraftment of liver Kupffer cells, and the absence of newly synthesized apoE in hepatocyte cultures from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice, we conclude that the apoE recovered in the media does not derive from Kupffer cells but represents recycled apoE.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	241	The content of apoE with nascent hepatic Golgi VLDL from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice was ~6% that found with control Golgi VLDL, and the mass of apoE released from hepatocytes from apoE+/+  apoE/ mice was ~6% that of apoE secreted by hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Since serum apoE levels in the apoE+/+  apoE/ mice are ~10% of control levels (17), the results suggest that as much as 60% of the internalized apoE is reutilized.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Under normal conditions, when the hepatocyte is faced with 10 times more apoE, the amount of apoE that is recycled may change.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (26) incubated radiolabeled apoE-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with Hep3b cells and fibroblasts and demonstrated that ~60% of the labeled apoprotein internalized by the cell was released intact into the medium after a 90-min chase.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The released apoproteins were primarily apoE and apoC.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	246	 (25) also report that as much as 26% of the apoE taken up on triglyceride-rich emulsions by HepG2 cells was released.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Finally, Takahashi and Smith (28) estimate that as much as 30% of apoE internalized by the murine macrophage RAW 264 cell line was resecreted.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	248	 It seems clear that the process of apoE sparing and reutilization may be variable among different cells but is not simply limited to the liver and is quantitatively important.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	249	The physiologic relevance of apoE reutilization and resecretion is unknown.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Recycling may provide a mechanism whereby the impact of apoE on intracellular and extracellular functions can be maximized.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for apoE in VLDL assembly.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Hepatic VLDL triglyceride production is decreased by nearly 50% in the apoE/ mice compared with C57BL/6 mice (13, 14), and the reconstitution of apoE expression via adenoviral transfer with the human apoE gene markedly increases hepatic VLDL triglyceride production (29).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Our studies confirm that hepatic triglyceride production rates are decreased in apoE/ mice compared with C57BL/6 mice (Fig.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	254	 However, introduction of apoE via BMT did not alter this rate, suggesting that apoE is routed to a site in the secretory pathway distal to VLDL assembly or triglyceride production.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Alternatively, introduction of apoE via BMT, an intervention that reconstitutes only 10% of the total serum apoE, may not provide intracellular concentrations of apoE needed to affect hepatic triglyceride production and VLDL secretion.
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Finally, it is plausible that recycling apoE may have other effects, such as increasing remnant uptake through the secretion-capture mechanism (30-32).
0.2925662.11304532.html.plaintext.txt	257	In conclusion, apoE internalized by the liver as a component of lipoprotein particles escapes the degradative pathway, is routed to the Golgi apparatus, and is subsequently secreted in quantitatively significant proportions.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is a major risk factor for Alzheimer and cardiovascular diseases.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	4	 ApoE4 differs from the two other common isoforms (apoE2 and apoE3) by its lower resistance to denaturation and greater propensity to form partially folded intermediates.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	5	 As a first step to determine the importance of stability differences in vivo, we reengineered a partially humanized variant of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE (T61R mouse apoE) to acquire a destabilized conformation like that of apoE4.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	6	 For this process, we determined the crystal structure of wild-type mouse apoE, which, like apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, and identified two structural differences in the turn between helices 2 and 3 and in the middle of helix 3 as potentially destabilizing sites.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Introducing mutations G83T and N113G at these sites destabilized the mouse apoE conformation.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The mutant mouse apoE more rapidly remodeled phospholipid than T61R mouse apoE, which supports the hypothesis that a destabilized conformation promotes apoE4 lipid binding.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E plays a central role in the transport and metabolic fate of lipids throughout the central nervous and cardiovascular systems (1-3).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	10	 One of the common human isoforms, apoE4, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The other two common isoforms, apoE3 and apoE2, each correlate with a lowered risk, respectively, for Alzheimer disease (4-8).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	12	 ApoE4 is also associated with poor outcome and recovery after neurological injury (9-11) and more rapid progression of multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (12, 13).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	13	The three isoforms are encoded by one gene and differ at one or two amino acid sequence positions.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	14	 ApoE3 has a cysteine at position 112 and a arginine at 158, and apoE2 has cysteines and apoE4 has arginines at both positions (14).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These sequence differences result in structural and biophysical properties that alter function and hence likely affect disease.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In apoE4, the two modular domains interact in a unique manner known as domain interaction (15-17).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Arg-112 in apoE4 causes the Arg-61 side chain to adopt a different conformation than it has in apoE2 and apoE3, allowing it to form a putative salt-bridge with Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (16, 18).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	18	The isoforms also differ in the conformational stability of the amino-terminal domains, which unfold independently from the carboxy-terminal domain and contain the isoform-specific sequence differences (19-22).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 is the least resistant to chemical and thermal denaturation and that of apoE2 is most resistant (20, 22).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 also most readily forms partially folded intermediates that have characteristics of a molten globule state (21).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	21	Increasing evidence indicates that molten globules are common and mediate a wide variety of physiological processes, including translocation across membranes, increased affinity for membranes, binding to liposomes and phospholipids, protein trafficking, extracellular secretion, and cell cycle regulation (23).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	22	 As one explanation for functional differences among the isoforms in vivo, we and others have suggested that partially folded intermediates provide apoE with greater conformational adaptability to bind to phospholipids (21, 24).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	23	Previously, our laboratory introduced domain interaction into mouse apoE.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Gene targeting was used to replace the threonine at the mouse equivalent of position 61 with an arginine (T61R), which resulted in an apoE4-like lipoprotein binding preference (25), a characteristic of domain interaction.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, unlike apoE4, T61R mouse apoE folds highly cooperatively and lacks apparent folding intermediates.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To gain in-sight into how differences in isoform stability affect phenotype and disease, we sought to introduce into T61R mouse apoE the reduced folding stability characteristic of apoE4.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	27	The objective here was to further humanize mouse apoE by replacing residues with those from apoE4 that destabilize the conformation.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	28	 An empirical approach was taken to change the urea-denaturation curve of T61R mouse apoE to resemble that of apoE4.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE was determined to identify potential structural differences between apoE4 and mouse apoE that might result in packing differences leading to differences in the urea denaturation curves.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	73	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Differences in the Urea Denaturation Curves of the Amino-terminal Domain of Mouse and Human ApoE Urea denaturation studies showed that the amino-terminal domain of apoE4 has a lower apparent conformational stability than apoE3 and apoE2 and a greater tendency to form partially folded intermediates, as revealed by a less cooperative transition from the folded state to the unfolded state (21).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The denaturation curve of T61R mouse apoE displayed greater cooperativity than apoE3 and apoE4 and unfolded at urea concentrations more similar to that at which apoE3 unfolds than apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Wild-type mouse apoE had a denaturation curve similar to that of T61R mouse apoE (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	76	Structural Comparison of the Amino-terminal Domain of Mouse and Human ApoE The crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE was determined to a resolution of 2.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	79	Excluding the eight additional amino-terminal residues of human apoE, the amino-terminal domains of mouse apoE and apoE4 differ at 35 sequence positions, corresponding to 81% sequence identity (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The overall fold of the amino-terminal domain of wild-type mouse apoE is similar to apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Except for residues 9-11, 166-172, and 186-191, the residues of the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE are clearly visible in the final electron density map.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	82	Although the amino-terminal domain of mouse apoE, like that of apoE4, forms a four-helix bundle, there are structural differences.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Alignment of the mouse and human structures along helices 1 and 2 shows that relative to apoE4 helices 3 and 4 (of the amino-terminal domain) of mouse apoE are shifted in a direction roughly parallel to the helical axis of helix 3.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In addition, helices 1, 2, and 4 are longer in mouse apoE than in apoE4.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	85	 A crystal contact at residue 20 in mouse apoE likely stabilizes the extension of helix 1; in apoE4 no such contact occurs.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	86	 A crystal contact at residue 126 of mouse apoE, which is not seen in apoE4, likely influences the structure of the loop between helices 3 and 4 (residues 120-130).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	87	Two Structural Differences at Positions 83 and 113 Are Mediated by Sequence Differences After exclusion of the crystal contact sites, two key structural differences result from the sequence differences.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The loop between helices 2 and 3 (residues 81-86) forms a tight turn in mouse apoE but is more extended and relaxed in all crystal structures of human apoE (33).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This difference reflects the cis conformation of Gly-83 in mouse apoE, which cannot be sterically accommodated by Thr-83 in apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In mouse apoE, helix 2 has one more helical turn than apoE4, and the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 are less parallel (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The numbering system for mouse apoE is standardized to the apoE4 sequence (apoE4 has eight additional amino-terminal residues).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Identical residues are highlighted in gray.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Major structural elements are noted above sequence (apoE4, black bars; mouse apoE, gray bars).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	96	  The other major difference is at residue 113, where mouse apoE contains asparagine, and apoE4 contains glycine (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Asn-113 in mouse apoE lies in a straight portion of helix 3, but the Gly-113 in apoE4 lies at a pronounced kink and cannot form the same hydrogen bond with Arg-112 that is formed by Asn-113 in mouse apoE (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The result is a reduced local hydrogen bond network (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In addition, because glycines have high configurational entropy, localized flexibility in the middle of helix 3 caused by Gly-113 may account for the lower stability and greater propensity of apoE4 to form partially folded intermediates.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The net effects of both sequence differences at positions 83 and 113 are a greater stabilization of helix 3 and a more parallel alignment of the dipoles of helices 2 and 3 in mouse apoE than in apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Thus, these data suggest that these two sequence differences contribute to the differences in the human and mouse urea denaturation curves.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The urea denaturation curves showed that the mutants unfolded in urea more readily than T61R mouse apoE and that the mutations had additive effects in destabilizing the conformation (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The triple mutant mouse apoE (T61R, G83T, N113G) and apoE4 displayed similar denaturation curves in the range of 0-4.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We introduced apoE4 residues at Q52L and/or H123Q, which occur at sites of crystal contacts, or apoE4 residues M114L and M149L together, which correlate with differences in the packing of the core into T61R mouse apoE.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	113	 These mutations had only marginal effects on the urea denaturation curves (data not shown).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Three other mutants were made with the T61R, G83T, N113G backbone that introduced nonconservative sequence differences, all with minimal effects on stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Introducing the apoE4 residues G94S and N120G or the group of residues N23G, G94S, N120G, P25R, G116V, and Q28L slightly reduced folding cooperativity and stability (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This suggests that the additional eight residues in apoE4 play a minor role in stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In contrast to mutations G83T and N113G, this collection of seven group mutations have minor effects on the urea denaturation curve.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Lipid binding was assessed with a standard apolipoprotein lipid binding assay that examines the ability of apoE to remodel large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC (35).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Upon binding to DMPC vesicles, apoE forms smaller apoE DMPC particles, thereby decreasing the turbidity of the solution (36).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Of the human isoforms, apoE4 clears the turbidity fastest, followed by apoE3 and apoE2 (21).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The amino-terminal domain of apoE4 cleared the turbidity in an exponential decay-like manner and much faster than T61R mouse apoE (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The destabilizing mutations, G83T and N113G, each cleared faster than T61R mouse apoE, and both mutations together further increased the clearance rate (Fig.

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	131	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Our objective in this study was to introduce instability into the mouse apoE mutant (T61R) that displays domain interaction, making it more apoE4-like.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Based on a comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of the amino-terminal domains of human apoE4 and wild-type mouse apoE, we identified two potential structural differences in the loop connecting helices 2 and 3 (position 83) and the middle of helix 3 (position 113) that likely would affect stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although there are several other differences between human and mouse apoE, we found that introduction of human residues G83T and N113G into the loop between helices 2 and 3 and the middle of helix 3 were all that was required to mimic the unfolding behavior of apoE4 (Fig.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The destabilized T61R mouse apoE has increased lipid binding properties, demonstrating an analogous functional switch from apoE3-like to apoE4-like.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	135	 It is interesting that stability of the apoE isoforms (apoE4  <  apoE3  <  apoE2) parallels the relative susceptibility of carriers of these isoforms to Alzheimer disease.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	136	This new model of apoE4 will be useful for testing and exploring the cooperative or additive effects of both domain interaction and a lower stability.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Furthermore, because T61R introduces domain interaction into wild-type mouse apoE, a mouse model specific for apoE4-reduced stability but without domain interaction can be made by the mutation E255A (16).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	138	For several other proteins, mutations or conditions that destabilize the native conformation also facilitate the formation of aggregates with properties of amyloid fibrils, which consist of an ordered polymer of -strands (37-39).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Thus, the destabilization of the compactly folded state of apoE, although advantageous for lipid binding, may predispose misfolding into amyloid fibrils.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This could provide a basis for amyloid formation because amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer patients show apoE immunoreactivity (40, 41).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The apoE isoforms differ in their ability to promote amyloid formation by A.
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In vitro, co-incubation of purified apoE with A, promotes A fibrillization, and the fibrils are coated with apoE (42).
0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	143	 ApoE4 facilitates the formation of a more extensive matrix of A fibrils than does apoE3, as assessed by electron microscopy (42, 43).

0.31053388.15890642.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Furthermore, in apoE knock-out mice expressing human apoE isoforms, apoE4 drives the nucleation and aggregation of immunopositive A deposits to a greater extent than apoE3 (50).

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	3	Within the central nervous system, apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis is increased in response to nerve injury, a finding that may reflect a role for apoE in neuronal remodeling.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Recent studies show that apoE3 promotes and apoE4 inhibits neurite outgrowth in cultured neuronal cells.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects are observed only when apoE is presented to cells in the presence of an exogenous lipid source such as rabbit -very low density lipoprotein (-VLDL), making it difficult to discern the biologically active form of apoE or to understand the role of the lipid source.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In the present study we tested whether a cell-derived lipidated form of apoE can alter neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL by constructing Neuro-2a cell lines expressing high levels of apoE.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Our results showed that endogenous apoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth, whereas the endogenous apoE4 isoform was neutral.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of the endogenous apoE3.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Characterization of the secreted apoE3 indicated that the neurite outgrowth-stimulating activity could be recovered from culture medium with an anti-apoE immunoaffinity column and was present in a poorly lipidated particle with a density between 1.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowth was inherent in the cell-derived apoE particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and -VLDL.

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The endogenous lipoproteins in CSF are predominantly HDL-like particles that arise from astrocyte-derived apoE in addition to apoAI, which presumably crosses the blood-brain barrier (7, 8).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The role of brain apoE is not known, although its expression appears to be correlated with nerve injury and neuronal remodeling (8-13).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	18	The three common isoforms of human apoE result from cysteine-arginine interchanges at residues 112 and 158 (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	19	 ApoE3 contains cysteine at residue 112 and arginine at residue 158.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	20	 ApoE2 contains 2 cysteines, whereas apoE4 contains arginines at these residues.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A correlation between the apoE 4 allele and late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease has been identified (15-17).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, the role of apoE in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	23	 There is evidence that apoE interacts with protein components of both pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) in an isoform- specific manner (18, 19).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, purified delipidated apoE will stimulate isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth when added to neuronal cells in culture (14, 20, 21).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A murine neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro-2a, exposed to delipidated apoE3 has significantly longer neurite extensions when compared with either control cells or cells treated with apoE4 (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The delipidated apoE4 isoform has an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth that correlates with destabilization of microtubular arrays (14).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Interestingly, these isoform-specific differences are only observed when an exogenous lipid source (rabbit -VLDL) is added along with the delipidated apoE isoforms.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Neither the rabbit -VLDL, which contains abundant rabbit apoE, nor the human apoE alone alters neurite outgrowth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	29	Neuro-2a cell lines expressing low quantities of apoE isoforms display similar isoform-specific differences in the presence of rabbit -VLDL, yet are indistinguishable from control cells that lack apoE expression in the absence of the exogenous lipid source (22).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Multiple lipid sources (VLDL, triglyceride-rich emulsions, HDL, and HDL-like CSF lipoproteins) can substitute for -VLDL to propagate similar isoform-specific differences (21-23).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, a puzzling aspect of these studies is that CSF lipoproteins fail to induce a difference in neuritogenesis unless they are enriched with exogenous human apoE (23), even though the CSF HDL-like particles already contain apoE (7, 23).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Importantly, these studies do not identify a physiologically significant or biologically active form of apoE because they require artificial lipid sources to observe apoE-induced stimulated neurite outgrowth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	33	If apoE-mediated alterations in neurite outgrowth are relevant to neuronal remodeling events in vivo, it is likely that the biologically active form of apoE is a cell-derived, lipidated complex that can act in the absence of -VLDL or other artificial lipid sources.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To test this possibility we constructed Neuro-2a cell lines that secrete higher levels of the apoE isoforms.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These cells produced a minimally lipidated apoE3 that stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of exogenous lipid.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Under identical conditions, apoE4 had no effect on neurite outgrowth, indicating that the E4 isoform was neutral and not inhibitory.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, exogenous -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effects of cell-derived apoE3.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Thus, these studies identified a minimally lipidated form of apoE that was biologically active in promoting neurite outgrowth.

0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	243	We produced high expressing apoE3 and apoE4 Neuro-2a cell lines to test whether cell-derived apoE could exhibit isoform-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth in the absence of an exogenous lipid source.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	244	 ApoE3 stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of -VLDL or other exogenous lipid sources.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Furthermore, cell-derived lipidated apoE3 isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography was active in promoting neurite outgrowth in parental Neuro-2a cells.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	246	 (14) discovered that the co-addition of purified delipidated apoE and -VLDL to Neuro-2a cells elicits isoform-specific differences in neurite outgrowth, effects also seen in other cell lines and primary neuronal cultures (20-23, 33).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Interestingly, these isoform-specific effects could not be duplicated by apoE addition alone.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Similarly, Neuro-2a cell lines that express low amounts of apoE isoforms also required -VLDL to elicit effects on neurite outgrowth (22).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It was unclear from these studies whether apoE3 stimulates neurite outgrowth independently but in concert with an exogenous lipid or whether an active form of apoE was formed only when it was combined with the exogenous lipid source.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Our results indicated that the biological activity of apoE3 in stimulating neurite outgrowths was inherent in the cell-derived lipidated particle and was not dependent on either (a) an interaction of apoE3 with an artificial lipid source or (b) independent actions of apoE3 and -VLDL on Neuro-2a cells.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	251	We demonstrated that cell-derived apoE4 was neutral when challenged in a neurite extension assay in the absence of -VLDL.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Although some studies have implicated apoE4 as being inhibitory to neurite outgrowth in the presence of an artificial lipid source (14, 22), other studies support the conclusion that apoE4 is neutral.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	253	 (21) showed an apoE3 enhancement of neurite outgrowth in the neuronal cell line GT1-1 trk9 only in the presence of -VLDL and nerve growth factor but no significant difference between apoE4-treated cells and controls under the same conditions.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Experiments with GT1-1 trk9 cells give similar results when HDL-sized particles from human CSF are substituted for -VLDL (23).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In further studies, Puttfarcken et al.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	256	 (34) showed that bulk conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells stably expressing either apoE3 or apoE4 isoforms are moderately stimulatory in primary hippocampal cultures.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	257	 These experiments (21, 34) as well as the present results argue that the apoE4 isoform is devoid of neurite-stimulating activity but is not inhibitory when presented to cells alone, in combination with exogenous lipids, or as a cell-derived lipidated particle.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	258	When present in the neurite extension assay, -VLDL antagonized the stimulatory effect of apoE3, an effect that was not detected in previous studies in which -VLDL was required for the effect of delipidated apoE (14, 20-23, 33).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	259	 It may be that in experiments with delipidated apoE, -VLDL acts as a lipid source to facilitate formation of an active apoE particle and at the same time antagonizes the action of the lipidated apoE.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In this case, the level of apoE3-stimulated neurite outgrowth would depend on the balance between these two factors.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Furthermore, it is unlikely that the antagonism observed in the present study is a nonspecific cytotoxic effect because -VLDL alone modestly stimulated neurite outgrowth (111%), an effect also observed by others (14, 20, 22).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The antagonism by -VLDL may reflect sequestration of secreted apoE or competition at a cellular receptor site.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	263	Cell-derived apoE occurred as a poorly lipidated particle with a density of 1.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Because this minimally lipidated form of apoE was biologically active in the absence of an exogenous lipid source, it was unlikely that the neurite outgrowth stimulation reflects an action of apoE to simply deliver lipid to the cell for membrane formation.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	265	 We speculate that apoE acted extracellularly to direct neurite extension or as a paracrine factor to stimulate neurite growth.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	266	How does the lipidated apoE3 particle stimulate neurite outgrowth although apoE4 remains neutral? The LDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) bind apoE containing lipoproteins and are expressed by neuronal cells (35-37).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Evidence from several studies implicate LRP in the apoE isoform-specific stimulation of neurite outgrowth (21, 22, 38).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In particular, inhibition of the apoE3 effect on neurite outgrowth by anti-LRP antibodies provides strong evidence for the involvement of LRP.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, binding studies with the LRP show no isoform-specific differences between apoE3 and apoE4 (27).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	270	 This discrepancy may be resolved by recent reports of other apoE receptors.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	271	 A new apoE receptor has been described which localizes to neurons and has a high homology to the LDL receptor (39).
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Additional brain-specific receptors with high homology to the LRP (40) and the LDL receptor (41) also have been identified.
0.29722524.9461617.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The present findings that a cell-derived form of apoE3 is active in stimulating neurite outgrowth will permit both physical characterization of the particles and analysis of isoform-specific interactions with these recently described neuronal receptors.

0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	2	Background Patients with Alzheimer's disease show a wide variation in clinical phenotype.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Genetic research has been largely concerned with the role of mutations or common variants as risk factors for the disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Do genetic factors also influence clinical phenotype?.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To examine the evidence that genetic factors influence the clinical expression of the disease in addition to influencing risk.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method A selective review was made of the key literature.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Mutations in three genes, coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, and a common variation (4) in another gene, APOE, have been shown to lead to an earlier development of the disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	8	 More recently, genetic association and twin studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the development of other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably the appearance of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions In Alzheimer's disease genetic variation influences a number of aspects of clinical phenotype.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early family and twin studies have indicated that a number of genes have an important part to play in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Variation in these genes, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms, appears to confer increased risk for the development of the disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apparent increased risk may be largely explained by the effects that genetic variation has on the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the age at which the disease presents.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it has been proposed that genetic variation may also explain some of the other features of clinical phenotype, including the development of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	14	The clearest evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is the existence of families in whom the disease is transmitted in a clear autosomal dominant pattern.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	19	While these findings are of immense importance in terms of elucidating the biological pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diease, it is important to recognise that these three causal genes may only account for 30-50% of all autosomal dominant early-onset cases, or around 10% of familial early-onset cases (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	21	The inheritance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is more complex than that of the early-onset form.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	29	More recently, the results of a number of linkage studies have become available.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	41	Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	46	GENETIC INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	47	Age of onset Families carrying mutations in the APP gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-65 years.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To date, no APP mutation carrier has been reported to be unaffected beyond the age of 67 years.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently been recorded with onset at 24 years (Wisniewski et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations are largely associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may be non-penetrant (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Penetrance is high but may not be 100%, with at least two reported cases of non-penetrance over the age of 80 years (Bird et al, 1996).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	53	The familial influence on age of onset in late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be substantial.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	62	Non-cognitive features If genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are associated with non-cognitive symptoms, then one might anticipate that subjects with a family history of the disease have an increased frequency of these symptoms.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Likewise, one would expect an association between known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including the genes for APP, PS-1, PS-2 and the ApoE 4 allele, and these symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	64	In fact, there appears to be little consistent evidence of an association between either a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease or variation in known candidate genes and an increase in the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms occurring for the first time within the disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990).
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	70	A more direct approach has also been adopted whereby common genetic polymorphisms previously showing associations with other neuropsychiatric conditions have been found to be associated with non-cognitive symptoms in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	75	Cognitive decline No study to date has looked at rates of decline in carriers of APP, PS-1 and PS-2 mutations, but patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease who have a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease show no evidence of increased rates of decline.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	80	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	81	8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	82	8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	83	0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic.

0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	88	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A number of genes have been implicated as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Variation in some of these genes appears to have a major effect in determining when   not if   the disease will develop.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably non-cognitive symptoms, are also influenced by genetic variation.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	91	LIMITATIONS A number of other risk genes have yet to be identified.
0.31515914.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The influence of these unknown genes on clinical phenotype is as yet undetermined.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	4	Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a constituent of several lipoproteins, is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor, and this interaction is important for maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have used a gene replacement strategy to generate mice that express the human apoE3 isoform in place of the mouse protein.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The levels of apoE mRNA in various tissues are virtually the same in the human apoE3 homozygous (3/3) mice and their littermates having the wild type mouse allele (+/+).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in fasted plasma from the 3/3 mice were not different from those in the +/+ mice, when maintained on a normal (low fat) chow diet.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We found, however, notable differences in the distribution of plasma lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E between the two groups: -migrating lipoproteins and plasma apoB100 levels are decreased in the 3/3 mice, and the apoE distribution is shifted from high density lipoproteins to larger lipoprotein particles.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition, the fractional catabolic rate of exogenously administered remnant particles without apoE was 6-fold slower in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	10	 When the 3/3 and +/+ animals were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a dramatic increase (5-fold) in total cholesterol compared with the +/+ mice (1.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	11	5-fold), and after 12 weeks on this same diet the 3/3 animals developed significantly (at least 13-fold) larger atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic sinus area than the +/+ animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus the structural differences between human APOE3 and mouse ApoE proteins are sufficient to cause an increased susceptibility to dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in the 3/3 mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	13	Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E is important for the transport of cholesterol and triglyceride throughout the body.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It is an amphipathic protein that stabilizes the structure of lipoprotein particles via its ability to bind lipid, and it functions as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, such as the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (1-3).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	15	 ApoE is a major protein component of chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), but it is not present on low density lipoproteins (LDL).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	16	 ApoE is also enriched in a subclass of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and functions as an effective ligand for their binding to the LDLR (4).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	17	The human APOE gene is located on chromosome 19 (5) as part of an apolipoprotein cluster that also includes the genes encoding APOCI, APOCII, and APOCIV (6).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Multiple tissue-specific enhancers and negative elements have been identified in the region proximal to the gene (7).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A distal enhancer, the hepatic control region, that is required for liver expression is located 15 kb downstream of the gene (8, 9).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The liver synthesizes approximately 70% apoE found in the body and 20% is found in the brain, and the remainder is synthesized in several tissues including the spleen, lung, heart, ovary, testis, kidney, and skin (10, 11).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	21	Three major APOE alleles, 2, 3, and 4, occur in humans at frequencies of 7.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These three alleles are distinguished by coding differences at positions 112 and 158 (13).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The most common isoform, apoE3, has a cysteine at position 112 and an arginine at position 158; the apoE2 isoform has a cysteine at both positions, whereas the apoE4 isoform has an arginine at both positions.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Functionally, the three isoforms differ in their affinity for the LDLR, with apoE3 and E4 exhibiting 100% binding and apoE2 displaying only 1% normal binding affinity (14).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Despite the lower affinity of apoE2 for the LDLR, individuals homozygous for 2 typically have lower than normal plasma cholesterol levels, except for the fraction of homozygotes (5-10%) who develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia (15).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Individuals homozygous for 4 have higher total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared with 3 homozygotes and are at increased risk for developing coronary artery disease (16).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The 4 allele is also associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (17, 18).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	28	ApoE isoform-specific effects are important in the etiology of atherosclerosis and other diseases, but appropriate animal models to rigorously investigate these effects are currently lacking.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To date, transgenic animals made by pronuclear injection of human DNA have been used to study these effects, but this method produces mice with varying levels of transgene expression due to differences in chromosomal location and copy number, and expression of the endogenous mouse apoE complicates the interpretation of the data (19-24, 47).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	30	 To overcome these difficulties we have used targeted gene replacement to generate mice that express only the human apoE3 isoform at levels that are in the physiological range.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In these mice the coding sequences for mouse apoE were replaced with sequences coding for human APOE3 without disturbing any of the known regulatory sequences.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This replacement results in animals with expression of human apoE mRNA, identical in tissue distribution and levels, to that of mouse apoE mRNA in wild type animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	33	We here describe the essentially normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels of mice homozygous for human apoE3 (3/3) when maintained on a normal (low fat) mouse chow diet but show that they are markedly more susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis than their wild type littermates (+/+).

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	276	We have successfully replaced the coding sequence of the mouse apoE gene with the equivalent human APOE3 coding region without altering any known endogenous regulatory sequences.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Expression of the human apoE mRNA in the liver, brain, and other tissues parallels that found normally in wild type mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Thus, the human APOE3 protein is functional and is expressed at physiological levels in these modified mice, thereby providing a model for studying the function of human APOE3 in vivo.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	279	To date, pronuclear injection of DNA has been used to generate transgenic animals expressing various forms of human APOE to study its role in lipid metabolism (19-24, 47).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	280	 There are three severe limitations to this approach as follows: the number of copies of the transgene can vary over wide ranges; there are marked and uncontrolled differences in the expression of transgenes at different chromosomal locations; and the presence of the endogenous mouse protein complicates the interpretation of the results.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Most importantly, rigorous comparisons between different isoforms are not possible because of the variable expression inherent in conventional transgenic animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	282	Mice made by replacement of the endogenous mouse coding region with the equivalent region of the human gene retain the natural chromosomal context at the apoE locus.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Thus, locus-specific sequences and enhancers are not altered except for any possible intragenic control sequences that differ between mice and humans.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Therefore, it was expected that tissue-specific expression of the human replacement APOE3 gene would closely parallel that of the endogenous mouse apoE gene.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Our mRNA studies show that this expectation was indeed fulfilled, with the exception of intestinal apoE mRNA which was slightly reduced in the 3/3 mice compared with the +/+ mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The significance of this reduction in intestinal expression is not clear, considering that intestinal apoE expression is very low compared with other tissues and that chylomicrons originating from the small intestine are known to contain very little apoE (34, 35).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Differences between the 3/3 and +/+ mice consequently are highly informative as far as function of the apolipoprotein itself are concerned.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Thus, gene replacement demonstrates the advantages over pronuclear injection in generating transgenic animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	289	The lipid profiles of the 3/3 and +/+ mice are very similar when the mice are maintained on a chow (low fat) diet, and the fasting levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol are essentially identical in the two animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	290	 However, when the same mice were fed a high fat diet, the 3/3 animals responded with a 5-fold increase in total cholesterol compared with a 1.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	291	5-fold increase in the +/+ animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Second, after 3 months on a high fat diet, the atherosclerotic plaques seen in all the 3/3 animals were 13-fold larger than those observed in the wild type controls.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Third, there was a 6-fold slower clearance rate of remnant lipoprotein particles in the 3/3 animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The accumulation of cholesterol and the delayed clearance of remnant particles observed in the 3/3 animals are likely causes of the increased susceptibility to lesion development.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	295	The dramatic delay in clearance of remnant particles in the 3/3 mice was unexpected since previous studies using transgenic mice expressing human APOE have revealed normal or enhanced clearance kinetics (22, 36).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	296	 One possible explanation for the observed delay in clearance is that the human APOE3 protein has a lower affinity to mouse LDLR and/or other receptors than mouse ApoE because of species differences in their structures.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Mouse and human apoE differ in 30% of their amino acid sequences with most of the differences being at the amino and carboxyl termini (1).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The receptor binding domain (residues 136-160) is highly conserved between mouse and human apoE since 21 of 25 residues are identical in this region including seven residues designated as critical for receptor binding (37, 38).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The residues that differ have conservative substitutions (e.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	300	 methionine for leucine) that do not affect the net charge or hydrophobicity of the protein and would not be predicted to have any substantial effects on the protein conformation (39).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Thus, it must be ascribed to differences outside the receptor binding domain if the affinity for the receptor differs between the mouse and human apoE proteins.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Species differences in the receptors that interact with apoE, such as the LDLR, and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, could also contribute to a lower affinity.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	303	A dysfunctional interaction between human APOE3 and mouse heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) may also contribute to the delay in clearance.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	304	 It has been postulated that HSPG's are involved in the initial sequestration process that enhances the uptake of apoE containing lipoproteins (40, 41).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The interaction of apoE with HSPG's is thought to occur mainly via electrostatic attraction (42).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Human APOE3 has a cysteine at position 112 where the mouse protein has an arginine at the equivalent position (mouse apoE residue 104).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	307	 This charge difference could be significant, even though residue 112 is outside the known heparin-binding domain.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	308	The delayed clearance could also be due to protein-protein interactions not involving receptors.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Several proteins are known to interact with apoE and play a role in lipid metabolism.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	310	 For example, the interaction of apoE with hepatic and lipoprotein lipases mediates/or enhances the catabolism of lipoproteins (41).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Lipoprotein particles containing human APOE3 may be less efficient in this type of interaction than mouse ApoE.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	312	 This would have important consequences in the remodeling and processing phase of lipoprotein catabolism.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	313	Another consideration in the clearance experiment is that the exogenously introduced remnant particles have to acquire apoE prior to their removal by receptors.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	314	 In +/+ mice most of the plasma apoE is associated with HDL particles that are presumably the source of apoE used to clear the exogenously added remnants.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In the 3/3 animals, however, the majority of plasma apoE3 is associated with large lipoproteins and may not transfer as easily to exogenously added particles.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	316	 In support of this, we and others (27) have noted that the distributions of apoE among mouse plasma lipoproteins analyzed by FPLC and by ultracentrifugation do not always agree and that apoE associated with HDL are more readily lost by ultracentrifugation.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Although the capacity for apoE3 to exchange between different classes of lipoproteins has not been documented, the decreased ability of apoE3 to transfer from large lipoproteins may have important implications.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	318	The association of apoE3 with larger lipoproteins in mice (Fig.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	319	 5, A and C) is different from observations made in humans that demonstrate a preference of apoE3 for HDL (1, 43).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	320	 It is very unlikely that this difference is the result of a mutation unexpectedly introduced into the APOE3 gene during its manipulation because in our work2 we observed that transgenic apoE3 mice, in an endogenous apoE (/) background, had a virtually identical apoE3 distribution pattern as seen in the 3/3 replacement mice.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	321	 These mice were made by pronuclear injection of a human cosmid clone isolated from a different individual from the one we used to make our mice (24).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Similar findings were also reported by Taylor et al.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	323	 (44) in transgenic apoE3 mice (that also express mouse apoE) which showed that the majority of human APOE3 resided in larger lipoprotein particles using SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis of fractions separated by sequential density ultracentrifugation.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	324	 In this work the authors also found that mouse ApoE and human APOE co-distributed among lipoproteins.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This is different from the results of our FPLC analysis of 3/+ heterozygote plasma which shows that approximately half of the mouse ApoE and only a minor fraction of human APOE3 was associated with HDL (data not shown).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	326	 It is not known whether the observed differences between our work and Taylor et al.

0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Further characterization of these large apoE3-rich lipoprotein particles is required to understand the observed delay in clearance in the 3/3 animals.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	329	The reduced clearance rate of remnant particles in the 3/3 mice, whatever its cause eventually proves to be, is not sufficient to cause any alteration in fasted plasma cholesterol levels in these animals relative to their +/+ littermates when the animals are on a normal chow diet.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The 3/3 mice are, however, much more susceptible to diet-induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis than their +/+ littermates.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Possibly, on the high fat diet a postprandial accumulation of -VLDL's occurs that leads to the development of atherosclerosis, as suggested by Zilversmit (45).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	332	 In human APOE2 homozygous individuals with type III hyperlipoproteinemia, there is an abnormal accumulation of remnant particles that has been suggested to cause accelerated coronary and peripheral vascular disease (46).
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Even small changes in lipid metabolism that decrease the clearance efficiency of lipoproteins are likely to have dramatic effects on the development of atherosclerosis, and thus the 3/3 animals give us an opportunity to investigate what changes are important.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	334	In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of targeted gene replacement to generate mice expressing the most common human isoform, APOE3, at physiological levels.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	335	 These mice allow us to document the behavior of the human APOE3 isoform in vivo in mice without any co-expression of mouse apoE.
0.30876386.9218423.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Future experiments comparing these mice with mice expressing the human apoE2 and E4 isoforms created in an identical manner should prove invaluable for studying diseases related to the different human apoE isoforms.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The APOE 4 allele is the most significant genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease to date.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that inheritance of one or more 4 alleles affects both the age of onset and the severity of pathology development.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Dosage of APOE 2 and 3 alleles, however, appear to be protective against the effects of 4.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although much of the biology of APOE in peripheral cholesterol metabolism is understood, its role in brain cholesterol metabolism and its impact on AD development is less defined.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Several APOE transgenic models have been generated to study the effects of APOE alleles on APP processing and Ass pathology.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, these models have potential limitations that confound our understanding of the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels and cholesterol metabolism on disease development.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	11	 To circumvent these limitations, we have taken a genomic-based approach to better understand the relationship between APOE alleles, cholesterol and Ass metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We have characterized APOE knock-in mice, which express each human allele under the endogenous regulatory elements, on a defined C57BL6/J background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These mice have significantly different serum cholesterol levels and steady-state brain APOE levels, and yet have equivalent brain cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, the presence of human APOE significantly increases brain Ass levels in a genomic-based model of AD, irrespective of genotype.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These data indicate an independent role for APOE in cholesterol metabolism in the periphery relative to the CNS, and that the altered levels of cholesterol and APOE in these mice are insufficient to influence Ass metabolism in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (APOE) functions as a lipid chaperone and facilitates cellular uptake of cholesterol and lipoproteins through receptor-mediated endocytosis.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The APOE gene, located on human chromosome 19q13.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	18	2, is a polymorphic locus represented by three common alleles, 2, 3 and 4.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These three alleles encode three APOE isoforms of 34 kDa that differ at amino acid positions 112 and 158.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These two amino acid substitutions confer slightly different functions for the respective proteins.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The E2 isoform, encoded by the 2 allele, contains a Cys at position 158, in comparison with the Arg found in the E3 and E4 isoforms.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The substitution of Cys for Arg alters the positive ion potential within the receptor-binding domain, and thus decreases the affinity of the E2 protein for the LDL receptor to 1% of the normal binding capacity (1,2).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Consequently, the level of circulating E2 protein is significantly higher than that of E3.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In contrast, the level of E4 protein is significantly lower than that of E3, presumably a consequence of the isoform-specific differences in lipid binding and uptake.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The ability of APOE to bind its receptors, which include LDLr, LRP, VLDLr and megalin, members of the LDL receptor family, dictates the efficiency with which these molecules are delivered to the appropriate cells and turned over.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	26	APOE 4 was first shown through association studies to be a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease, presumably through its role in conferring high circulating cholesterol levels, mainly in the form of LDL, in individuals with one or more copies of the allele (3,4).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Subsequently, APOE 4 was found to be associated with increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (5,6).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Furthermore, the presence of one or more 4 alleles decreases the age of disease onset by as much as 10 years (7).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	29	One hypothesis as to the link between APOE genotype, cardiovascular disease and AD involves the contribution of cholesterol homeostasis to both diseases and the role of APOE in this process.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Several studies have implicated a role for cholesterol in the production of Ass, the primary constituent of senile plaques in the AD brain (8 to 12).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	31	 High serum cholesterol levels in mice transgenic for APP, the precursor protein for the Ass peptide, correlate with increased brain Ass levels and a more severe plaque load (13,14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Retrospective epidemiological studies have demonstrated a decreased AD risk in human populations on statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels (reviewed in 15), although this effect may be indirect, as several studies have shown that statins do not alter the Ass levels in serum (16,17).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Several studies have reported an association of elevated serum cholesterol levels with AD risk and levels of Ass (18,19), independent of APOE genotype.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Other studies, however, have failed to demonstrate a correlation between serum cholesterol levels and AD development (20).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	35	 APOE 4 may affect AD risk by conferring high cholesterol levels and thereby increasing Ass production.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	36	 AD patients with an 4 allele have increased levels of Ass1 to 40 in their brains and CSF, and have more extensive plaque pathology (21,22).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Interestingly, the 2 allele, which confers low cholesterol levels, is also considered to be protective against AD development (7).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	38	Several APOE transgenic mouse models have been generated in efforts to gain insight into the role of APOE in AD (23 to 26).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These models utilize various promoters to drive the expression of human APOE cDNAs in neurons and glia.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This approach has several limitations concerning the regulation of APOE in both the brain and the periphery.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	41	 First, most APOE transgenic studies have attempted to normalize APOE levels in the APOE 3 or 4 transgenic lines with respect to each other (23) or to endogenous levels (24).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, several human studies suggest that levels of APOE vary with genotype and may impact AD pathogenesis.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Second, all APOE transgenic lines have been bred onto the Apoe-null background, which confers high circulating cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Given the role of Apoe in peripheral cholesterol metabolism and the growing evidence for cholesterol levels influencing brain Ass metabolism, it is unclear how the absence of Apoe affects AD pathology in these animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Importantly, there has been no consensus about the impact of APOE genotype on AD pathogenesis from these studies, perhaps owing to the complications of different promoters and altered levels of APOE in the brain, combined with the complications of a mixed genetic background in these models.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	46	APOE knock-in (KI) mice provide unique model for understanding how each APOE allele behaves in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We have obtained these mice, previously published by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	48	 (27), in order to further characterize the behavior of human APOE alleles in a defined genetic background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We present APOE protein abundance, cholesterol and lipoprotein data from young animals expressing APOE 2, 3 and 4 on a defined C57BL/6J background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We demonstrate significant differences in protein abundance, which mirrors the human data, as well as significant differences in serum cholesterol levels in the absence of an effect on APP processing.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The presence of APOE significantly increases levels of both Ass and cholesterol in brain, irrespective of allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This genomic-based mouse model provides evidence that neither cholesterol levels nor APOE abundance alone is sufficient to influence Ass metabolism in young animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	53	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Generation of genetically defined APOE KI mice The APOE 4 allele is the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease identified to-date, Much work has been done in the mouse to understand how the different alleles of APOE affect the onset and development of pathology in an AD mouse model; however, these transgenic models have several limitations that confound the study of APOE gene regulation and gene function in mouse models of AD.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	54	 To circumvent these limitations, we took advantage of APOE KI animals generated at the Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Science, Japan (27).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The targeted allele placed the human cDNA for each APOE allele in-frame with the endogenous exon 1 sequence and part of exon 2.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This allowed for control of human APOE expression by endogenous regulatory elements, while at the same time removing the mouse Apoe coding sequence.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	57	 APOE 4 KI mice generated by this strategy were previously published (27).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It was demonstrated that human APOE in these mice is expressed in serum and in astrocytes in the correct histological pattern.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Work from our lab and others has demonstrated that genetic background can greatly influence phenotypic expression, particularly with regards to Ass generation and deposition (28).

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	200	 APOE increases Ass levels in a genomic-based APP transgenic mouse in the absence of changes in APP processing.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Unlike previously reported APOE transgenic models, which express normalized levels of APOE only in the brain, our genomic-based approach allows us to address two hypotheses surrounding the role of APOE 4 as a risk factor for AD.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	202	 APOE genotype and AD risk in humans correlate with both serum cholesterol levels and steady-state levels of APOE protein.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	203	 APOE 4, the most significant genetic risk factor for AD, is associated with both high circulating cholesterol levels and reduced steady-state APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In contrast, APOE 2 is protective against AD and incidentally confers both low serum cholesterol levels and high levels of APOE.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thus, APOE may affect AD risk through its involvement in cholesterol metabolism, shown through diet studies in the mouse to directly affect Ass production.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Alternatively, brain APOE levels may influence the clearance efficiency of the Ass peptide and its subsequent deposition.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	207	APOE abundance Much is known about APOE biology in humans, particularly its role in lipid metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	208	 APOE is primarily synthesized in the liver and brain; additional sites include the adrenal gland and kidney (38,39).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	209	 APOE genotype has been shown to correlate with APOE abundance in the periphery (33,40 to 42); the 2 allele confers high APOE, whereas the 4 allele confers low APOE, with respect to 3 levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The effect of APOE alleles on APOE abundance in the brain and CSF is less clear owing to conflicting reports, with many studies concentrating on the abundance of APOE in AD brains relative to controls, irrespective of APOE genotype (35,43,44).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	211	We demonstrate by both western blot analysis and ELISA that the steady-state levels of APOE in tissues and serum from the three KI lines are genotype-dependent and reflect the human data for serum APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	212	 2 KI animals have significantly higher levels of APOE in all tissues examined (P < 0.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Our findings, particularly the data from brain, illustrate the innate differences in the behavior of the three human APOE alleles in the mouse, arguing for the relevance of a genomic-based APOE model in understanding APOE function.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The differences in brain APOE levels in our KI mice may have important implications for how APOE influences pathology development in an AD mouse model.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	215	 A recent report by Sullivan et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	216	 (45), showing that brain APOE levels are genotype-independent in a different set of APOE KI animals contradicts these data.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, their reported APOE lines contain a neo cassette in the targeted allele that may affect protein expression.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	218	 An additional difference is the inclusion of human APOE intron 1 in the targeted allele of their mice, which may contain additional endo genous regulatory elements.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Further comparisons between their mice and ours will be necessary to determine the innate differences between the two models.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	220	APOE and cholesterol metabolism in mice In addition to protein levels, we show that APOE genotype also impacts cholesterol levels in the periphery.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The 4 KI animals have fasted cholesterol levels that are slightly below those of B6 wild-type animals, whereas the 2 KI animals have 2-fold higher cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The 3 KI and B6 wild-type cholesterol levels do not significantly differ.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These data recapitulate what has been shown in other APOE KI models (46 to 48), but are opposite from the findings in humans, where the 4 allele is associated with high and 2 with low cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These data highlight the innate differences in mouse and human cholesterol metabolism, which include the utilization of different lipoproteins to transport cholesterol.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Our data also contrast with the initial report of the 4 KI mice by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	226	5-fold increase in levels of circulating cholesterol relative to wild-type controls.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This discrepancy in the data may be attributed to several factors.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The first, and perhaps most notable, is the difference in genetic background between these two studies.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a strong genetic component to cholesterol metabolism in the mouse (46 to 48).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This complex trait involves genes that work both in an additive manner as well as epistatically (49).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our analysis of cholesterol in these KI mice over subsequent backcrosses further argues for background effects, as demonstrated by comparing the cholesterol levels in the 4.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	232	40 animals at the N8 backcross generation (Table 1 versus Fig.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Second, the KI mice that we report no longer transmit the neo cassette in the targeted allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Although there is no direct evidence to suggest that the presence of neo affects the function of APOE or cholesterol metabolism in these mice, this cannot be ruled out.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Finally, the differences in diet or methodology between the two studies may also impact the reported cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	236	Further characterization of lipoprotein profiles from our reported 3 and 4 KI mice demonstrated that the majority of cholesterol distributed to the HDL fraction, similar to B6 wild-type animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These data suggest that the presence of human APOE 3 or 4 does not disrupt mouse cholesterol metabolism, an observation also made by Maeda and colleagues (50 to 52).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Comparison of these profiles with that published by Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	239	 highlights a further distinction between their 4 KI model and that characterized here.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In contrast to our data, Hamanaka et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	241	 showed cholesterol distributed to all lipoprotein classes in the 4 KI mice, including VLDL and LDL.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This profile is actually most similar to that of the 2 KI animals presented here.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	243	 These animals have significantly higher cholesterol levels and appear to transport the excess circulating cholesterol in the VLDL and LDL fractions, suggesting an impaired cholesterol metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The noted increase in triglyceride levels in these 2 KI animals also suggests the development of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, a complex disorder characterized by high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which affects 10% of humans homozygous for the 2 allele (53).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	245	 It has been suggested by Sullivan et al.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	246	 and others (51,54) that this condition manifests itself in 2 KI mice owing to the presence of additional genetic factors in the mouse genome that interact with the 2 allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	247	Qualitative western blot analysis of 3 and 4 KI FPLC profiles demonstrated that the behavior of E3 in mice maintained on a low cholesterol diet follows that of endogenous Apoe, found mainly in the IDL/LDL, with some in the HDL fraction; E4 appears to be enriched in the HDL fraction.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This observation may reflect another difference between mouse and human cholesterol metabolism.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The E4 isoform has a greater affinity for large lipoproteins, which in humans are chylomicrons and VLDL.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	250	 E2 and E3, on the other hand, prefer smaller lipoproteins and are primarily found associated with HDL, the smallest lipoprotein class.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Importantly, mouse plasma is enriched in a large, Apoe-rich HDL that is absent in normal human plasma (36).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	252	 It may be that E4 has a preference for these particles over the other two isoforms.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Our mice do not show an enrichment of APOE in VLDL, as observed by Maeda and colleagues.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This discrepancy with our data may be explained by differences in genetic background or diet.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Further comparisons between these two sets of APOE KI models, including levels of protein, will be required to thoroughly explain these results.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	256	Cholesterol and APP processing In order to identify the effects of each APOE allele on APP processing and Ass production, particularly with regard to cholesterol metabolism and APOE abundance, we crossed the APOE KI animals to R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Several studies have established a link between cholesterol and APP processing (10,55,56).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	258	 (13) demonstrated that cholesterol influences the cleavage of APP by beta-secretase in vivo, with hypercholesterolemia increasing CTFss levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	259	 However, neither levels of holo APP nor CTFs were altered in the APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The lack of an effect on APP processing in the 2 KI animals was unexpected, considering their high serum cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	261	Analysis of Ass1 to 40 levels in these animals provided further evidence that serum cholesterol alone is not enough to affect APP processing at this young age.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Given the strong evidence for high cholesterol levels increasing Ass production (13) we predicted that the 2 KI animals, with a 2-fold increase in total serum cholesterol, would demonstrate much higher levels of Ass than the 3 KI and 4 KI mice.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, similar to the CTF data, the levels of Ass1 to 40 in brain were indistinguishable across lines.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	264	 There are several possible explanations for these results.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	265	 First, the data we present here come from 28-day-old animals, an age just post-weaning and prior to sexual maturity.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	266	 It is possible that the ability of cholesterol to affect APP processing and Ass metabolism is time- or age-dependent.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Successful diet studies have chronically fed mice high cholesterol diets for several weeks (13,14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Chronic exposure to high serum cholesterol levels for several weeks or months may be required to affect Ass metabolism in the APOE;R140 animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Assaying levels of Ass1 to 40 in older animals will be useful to further understand the age component of cholesterol effects and APOE on APP processing.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	270	Second, we show that peripheral cholesterol metabolism does not affect CNS cholesterol regulation.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Despite the differences in serum cholesterol in the three APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	272	40 lines described in this manuscript, brain cholesterol levels are indistinguishable in these animals.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This finding is supported by a large body of evidence demonstrating that cholesterol metabolism in the periphery is fundamentally different from and independent of that in the central nervous system, involving different lipoproteins and apolipoproteins (57 to 59).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	274	 This argues against an effect of peripheral cholesterol on processes in the brain.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	275	40 animals demonstrate significantly increased brain cholesterol levels over R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	276	40 animals with endogenous Apoe; brain cholesterol levels in the E3.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	277	R140 animals were also greater than those of R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	278	40, although the trend was not statistically significant.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	279	 These data correspond with significant increases in brain Ass1 to 40 levels in the APOE;R1.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	280	40 animals, suggesting that brain cholesterol levels in particular may have a significant impact on Ass production.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Notably, one diet study increased brain cholesterol in addition to Ass levels (14).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Our data argue for the independent roles of APOE in peripheral and CNS cholesterol metabolism, and furthermore suggest a distinction between APOE and endogenous Apoe effects on both murine brain cholesterol metabolism and steady-state Ass levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	283	APOE and Alzheimer's disease This manuscript highlights the first report of an APOE mouse model that utilizes endogenous regulation to study native APOE levels and cholesterol metabolism in relation to Alzheimer's disease.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Importantly, the correlation between APOE genotype, APOE steady-state levels and cholesterol metabolism observed in humans is uncoupled in the KI mice.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This allows us to further dissect two aspects of APOE function that may impact the development of AD, cholesterol metabolism and Ass clearance.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	286	 APOE abundance in the brains of 4 KI animals is low, but these animals have normal serum cholesterol levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	287	 These animals allow us to study the effects of low APOE levels in the absence of high cholesterol, which is often observed in humans who inherit an 4 allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Likewise, the 2 KI animals have both high serum cholesterol and high brain APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These animals are useful to determine the effects of high cholesterol independent of low APOE levels.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Future experiments will assess the effects of both age and diet in the APOE;R1.

0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	293	 APOE characterization: male KI animals for each line were backcrossed two generations onto the C57BL/6J background.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Male progeny of the N2 generation were then crossed to Zp3-cre transgenic animals congenic on the C57BL6/J background (31).
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Female progeny from this cross (N3 generation) were selected for on the basis of the presence of both the human APOE and the Zp3-cre transgene.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	296	 An additional backcross of these animals yielded progeny of the N4 generation that were selected for on the basis of the presence of APOE and the absence of the neo cassette in the targeted allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Males from this cross were backcrossed to N5 before animals were intercrossed to obtain homozygous KI animals of each allele.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	298	 These animals were used for the characterization studies of human APOE in the mouse, and no longer carried the ZP3-cre transgene.
0.37081465.15229191.html.plaintext.txt	299	 For analysis of APP processing and Ass metabolism, APOE KI animals backcrossed to the N7 generation were crossed to B6.

0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	4	Inheritance of the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is a major risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although the association between APOE4 and AD is well documented, the mechanism by which apolipoprotein E exerts an isoform-specific effect on neurons in disease is unknown.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this report, we demonstrate that apoE4 stimulates the transcriptional activity of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in rat primary hippocampal neurons.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, apoE3 was unable to stimulate CREB transcriptional activity and unable to activate the ERK pathway.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels are also involved because treatment with receptor-associated protein, nifedipine, MK801, removal of Ca2+ from the medium and dantrolene all served to inhibit calcium elevation and attenuate the activation of CREB.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Treatment with an apoE peptide was also found to facilitate transcription of the CREB-dependent genes, c-fos and Bcl-2.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In contrast to treatment with apoE3, our findings suggest apoE4 and apoE-peptide induce a novel signaling pathway.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	11	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	12	Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurological disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive deficits.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	13	 To date, four genes have been reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease phenotypes including the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (1-4), the presenilin-1 gene on chromosome 14 (5), the presenilin-2 gene on chromosome 1 (6-7), and the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) 1 gene on chromosome 19 (8-10).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	14	 There are three common alleles of the APOE gene: 3 is the most common representing ~78% of all APOE alleles, 4 representing 15% and 2 representing 7% (11).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although these alleles give six possible genotypes, the risk of Alzheimer's disease is increased, and the age of onset distribution is earlier, with each dose of 4 (8).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	16	 While the influence of the APOE-4 genotype was clearly demonstrated, the biological mechanism mediated by apoE4, the translated protein isoform derived from the 4 allele of APOE gene remains speculative.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	17	Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding potential mechanisms where apoE4 enhances the risk for Alzheimer's disease.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	18	 One interesting hypothesis is that apoE4 itself causes toxicity to hippocampal neurons, but that apoE3 does not (12-13).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A 22-kDa thrombin cleavage fragment of apoE4 known as "truncated apoE4" and an apoE peptide consisting of a tandem repeat of amino acid residues 141-149 of apoE showed higher toxicity to neurons than apoE4 itself (14-15).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Their toxicity was apoE receptor-mediated (14) and involved calcium influx (16).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Based on these reports, we started to study the mechanism of apoE toxicity using the synthetic apoE peptide.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	22	We employed the Mercury Pathway Profiling System (CLONTECH) to elucidate the mechanistic pathways activated in the presence of apoE peptide.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This system evaluates several cis-acting enhancer elements such as AP1, CRE, HSE, Myc, NFB, and serum response element and among them, transcription from the CRE element was found to be activated.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition to the apoE peptide, a specific isoform of the apoE protein was found to stimulate the phosphorylation that activates CREB.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We then examined the pathway upstream of CREB activation and found that ERK and the apoE receptor are involved in this same pathway.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Downstream of CREB, the expression of c-fos and Bcl-2 genes that are modulated by activated CREB, were also increased.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Our finding that apoE4 stimulates phosphorylation of CREB through an ERK pathway to increase transcription of specific genes while apoE3 does not, suggests a mechanism of apoE isoform-specific function on neurons.

0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	154	Although evidence of the association between the 4 allele of the APOE gene and Alzheimer's disease is overwhelming, the mechanism by which the apoE4 protein isoform influences onset and progression of the disease and its pathology is unknown.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Of the many suggested mechanisms, we have focused on reports that apoE3 and apoE4 protein isoforms have differential effects on neuronal plasticity and survival (13, 23, 24).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Compared with the apoE3 protein isoform, apoE4 protein, proteolytic fragments of apoE4 protein, and peptides corresponding to the receptor-binding domain of apoE proteins appear to actively injure, and certainly do not support maintenance of healthy neurites and neuronal cells (13-16).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	157	 On the larger scale, the failure of apoE4 protein isoforms and their related fragments to support neuronal plasticity and maintenance may infer a mechanism that underlies the association between APOE gene alleles and disease.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	158	Under many conditions that eventually result in neuronal death, the cell struggles to induce protective mechanisms even though destructive forces inevitably march forward.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In this report, we have demonstrated one such scenario where apoE4, but not apoE3, activates an ERK cascade that results in activation of CREB and induction of many different genes including the cell-protective gene, Bcl-2.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In prior reports, we showed that overexpression of only Bcl-2 protein could inhibit neuronal death following a toxic insult (25).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In this case, treatment of neurons with recombinant apoE4 protein or with synthetic apoE peptide resulted in CREB phosphorylation and induced Bcl-2 expression, events which were not observed following recombinant apoE3 protein treatments.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Time course experiments showed that the increase in phospho-CREB levels following apoE4 protein treatments appeared to be slower than that by apoE peptide, although their molar concentrations were the same.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This time lag is consistent with previous results where protease inhibitors reduced the neurotoxicity of apoE4 (16) through a presumed mechanism where the full-length apoE4 protein must be digested over time to produce a toxic fragment of apoE4.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Despite the increases in phospho-CREB and Bcl-2, we also observed apoE4/apoE peptide-mediated increases in calcium levels that were also observed by others in the context of their association with neuronal death (16, 26).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	165	The apoE4/apoE-peptide-mediated increase of intracellular Ca2+ can be generated by calcium influx from the extracellular space and release of calcium from intracellular stores.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Significant attenuation of increased intracellular calcium levels was observed when we cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons in the medium lacking Ca2+ and containing EGTA as a Ca2+ chelator, suggesting that calcium influx from extracellular sources follows apoE4/apoE peptide treatments.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	167	 When we measured the intracellular Ca2+ elevation following preincubation with 10  microM dantrolene, an inhibitor of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel on ER membranes, Ca2+ elevation was also significantly attenuated, suggesting the participation of the calcium influx from ER in the elevation of intracellular Ca2+.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Interestingly, extracellular Ca2+-free conditions did not seem to have any additional effect on attenuating the Ca2+ elevation following preincubation with dantrolene, suggesting that calcium influx from the extracellular space may serve to trigger a larger amount of Ca2+ release from the ER through ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel in a "Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release" fashion.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Thus, calcium influx from extracellular space may be less than calcium release from intracellular sources such as the endoplasmic reticulum.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	170	The apoE peptide-mediated increase in phospho-CREB levels and of intracellular Ca2+ levels was inhibited by pretreatment with RAP, MK801, or nifedipine, suggesting that apoE receptors, NMDA receptor, and LVDCC are involved in rat hippocampal neuron responses to apoE.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	171	 (16) reported that RAP and MK801 attenuated the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused by truncated apoE.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	172	 They also reported that nifedipine did not provide any protection against the apoE-mediated rise in intracellular Ca2+ in rat hippocampal neurons, but data was not shown.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	173	 (26) reported that RAP, MK801, and diltiazem, another inhibitor of LVDCCs, failed to block the apoE peptide-induced calcium influx in rat primary cultured neurons.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Assuming that neurotoxicity is caused by calcium influx following apoE treatment, our data are consistent with the data provided by Tolar et al.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	175	 (16) in that RAP and MK801 attenuated calcium influx (16).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This result suggests that LRP or some other apoE receptors found in neurons may be linked to NMDA receptor.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Our finding that preincubation with nifedipine almost completely inhibited the apoE peptide-induced calcium influx is reasonable because calcium entry through NMDA receptors may depolarize the plasma membrane and open LVDCCs that results in larger amount of calcium influx.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Compared with the calcium entry from LVDCCs, calcium entry from NMDA receptors may be negligible (27).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Nevertheless, this calcium elevation can activate kinases such as ERK and calmodulin kinase II that function to phosphorylate CREB (27).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	180	Further inhibition experiments showed that pretreatment with a MEK inhibitor and/or a PKA inhibitor mostly prevented the apoE-peptide stimulated phosphorylation of CREB, suggesting that activation of both MEK and PKA kinases are involved in the pathway.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Ca2+ elevation stimulates CREB phosphorylation by activation of a PKA-dependent, Rap1-MEK-ERK pathway (28).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Pretreatment with KN62 or SB203580 did not appear to have any effect on the phosphorylation status of CREB, suggesting that the ERK cascade is a major pathway leading the phosphorylation of CREB following apoE treatment.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	183	Upon binding to the CRE element of a gene's promoter, the transcription factor known as CREB facilitates transcription of many different genes, such as c-fos, Bcl-2, and BDNF (27, 29-31).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	184	 CREB that actively binds its DNA element, CRE, is typically phosphorylated on serine at position 133.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Activation of CREB by its phosphorylation at serine residue 133 is modulated by a variety of effectors.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	186	 -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) /kainate receptors and NMDA receptors are associated with synapses and LVDCCs are involved in neuronal functions like long-term potentiation (32-34).
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Stimulation of these receptors has also been associated with increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, potentiation of kinase activities, and CREB activation.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	188	To clarify if calcium influx caused by apoE treatment causes neurotoxicity and parallels phosphorylation of CREB, we measured the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ caused by apoE peptide in rat hippocampal neurons upon exposure to these receptor antagonists.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	189	 As others has reported (16), treatment of apoE peptide to rat primary hippocampal neurons caused calcium influx and intracellular Ca2+ levels to rise.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Preincubation with RAP, MK801, or nifedipine clearly attenuated the Ca2+ elevation (Fig.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	191	 7A), which parallels our data on CREB phosphorylation mediated by apoE peptide, suggesting the involvement of apoE receptor.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	192	We have shown a possible mechanism whereby apoE4 facilitates the expression of CRE-driven genes and apoE3 does not (Fig.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	193	 We hypothesize that apoE4, which stimulates CREB phosphorylation, may be associated with synaptic plasticity.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This apparent isoform specificity of the effects might be relevant to the isoform-specific association of apoE4 as a significant risk factor in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	197	 When apoE4, but not apoE3, binds to apoE receptor on the surface of hippocampal neuron, NMDA receptors open.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Activation of NMDA receptor causes small amounts of Ca2+ entry into postsynaptic spines.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The resulting depolarization triggers the opening of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels exist in cytoplasmic membranes of the neurons.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The activation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, which is open during strong depolarization, permit the entry of larger amount of Ca2+ along the dendrites and into the cell bodies, causing the opening of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel on ER membrane and the influx of larger amount of Ca2+ from ER in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release fashion.
0.3285698.11042199.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The Ca2+ entry from extracellular space may be negligible, comparing that from ER calcium elevation allows activation of PKA-dependent Rap1-ERK pathway and phosphorylation of CREB.

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	4	The APOE [epsis]4 allele is a strong genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	10	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	14	 There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	15	There has been little examination of the mRNA expression of APOE in AD (5,6).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	 have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	20	We hypothesised that, since [epsis]4 homozygotes have a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes, and a high proportion of individuals with the latter genotype reach a greater age without developing AD, a likely explanation of this was that there was genetic variability in neural expression at the APOE locus and that [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygote individuals who were high [epsis]4 expressors and/or low [epsis]3 expressors were more likely to develop AD than individuals with high [epsis]3 expressors and/or low [epsis]4 expressors.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	21	The identification of the APOE allele transcription products is easily achieved by RT-PCR, using restriction fragment length polymorphism.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure allelic expression of APOE mRNA by RT-PCR using silver staining (11).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This method of quantitation has been applied to brains of heterozygote subjects collected at various centres and used to assess the percentage of [epsis]4 mRNA expression in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 subjects and [epsis]2 mRNA expression in [epsis]2[epsis]3 individuals.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This has been carried out both in AD cases and controls.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	We selected a series of [epsis]3[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 12) in order to measure the relative level of expression of the APOE allele in the frontal cortex (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	28	 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	31	2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	32	4% in the only AD case versus 45.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	34	25-fold increase of the [epsis]4 allele ratio (P = 0.

0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	37	Figure 2 Differential expression of the APOE mRNA for the three heterozygote genotypes in Alzheimer's disease cases and controls.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The [epsis]2 mRNA percentage was measured in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population and the [epsis]4 mRNA percentage in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 population.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The average level of expression is indicated by a bold line in each category.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For each brain sample, RT-PCR and semi-quantitation was repeated three times.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to note that measurement of the ratio of expression of the two alleles in heterozygotes is likely to be a much more robust measurement than the determination of absolute levels of mRNA expression in the same tissue, since the latter will be profoundly affected by post-mortem delay, agonal state and cell population and density.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	42	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	46	 It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	48	 At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	49	 As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	54	To date, it seems difficult to link APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	56	 But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	58	There are two major findings in our work.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	59	 First, that the expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than the expression of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Second, that the expression of the [epsis]4 allele beyond a certain level seems to greatly influence the vulnerability of an individual to Alzheimer's disease.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	61	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	62	 showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	63	 showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene.
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	67	Interestingly, Templeton reached a similar conclusion using a cladistic analysis of our previously reported genetic data (4).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22).
0.407656.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Our data suggest that the influence of non-coding polymorphism on ApoE expression may supply the rest of the answer.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	5	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity is consistently present in the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In vitro, apoE, and in particular its apoE4 isoform, can bind to and promote fibrillogenesis of the amyloid A peptide, the main constituent of senile plaques.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	7	 These findings, together with the strong genetic association between late onset AD and the E4 allele of apoE, have strengthened the hypothesis that apoE may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by modulating A cerebral accumulation.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, apoE immunoreactivity is present in all cerebral and systemic amyloidoses tested, and tryptic apoE fragments have been identified in association with amyloid A (AA).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In order to further elucidate the interaction between apoE and amyloids, we purified AA and amyloid L (AL) fibrils from patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary amyloidosis, respectively, and studied the association of apoE with AA and AL proteins.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In each case, apoE fragments, detected by Western blot, co-purified with the amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Microsequencing analysis identified COOH-terminal fragments of apoE, similar to the 10-kDa fragment produced by thrombin digestion that contains the purported binding region to A.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In vitro co-incubation of AA with purified human apoE resulted in the formation of an SDS-resistant AAapoE complex and a higher degree of polymerization of the AA peptide.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings and similar results obtained from AD senile plaques suggest that 1) the carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoE is complexed to amyloid fibrils and resists proteolysis in vivo and 2) apoE may promote amyloidogenesis through a conformation-dependent interaction regardless of the primary structure of the amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	14	Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein conformation in which low molecular weight proteins that are soluble under physiological conditions become deposited and accumulate either intact or partially digested in diverse tissues and organs as insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In spite of their biochemical diversity, amyloid proteins adopt a common secondary structure, the -pleated sheet, and form fibrils of similar morphology.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These fibrils are characteristically long straight filaments 5-12 nm wide that share the tinctorial properties of green birefringence after Congo red staining and specific affinity for fluorescent dyes such as Thioflavine S or T.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition to these features shared by most types of amyloids, there are several factors consistently associated with this pathological condition that can be viewed as part of the biochemical setting in which amyloid deposition arises and develops.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These include elevated concentration of amyloid precursors in fluids and tissues and the invariable presence of certain amyloid-associated proteins of which amyloid P-component (AP)()(1, 2) , sulfated proteoglycans (3, 4, 5) , apolipoprotein E (apoE) (6, 7) and apolipoprotein J (8) are the most notorious.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Whether these amyloid-associated proteins play an active role by promoting or inhibiting amyloidogenesis or are inert bystanders is at present unknown.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	20	ApoE is a 34-kDa exchangeable apolipoprotein, present in all types of lipoprotein particles, that is involved in cholesterol transport as well as other less defined functions such as nerve regeneration after injury(9, 10, 11, 12) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The recently reported association between certain apoE genetic isoforms and Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition characterized by the massive deposition in the brain of the 39-44-residue amyloid -protein (A)(13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) , has strengthened the hypothesis that this apolipoprotein may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this cerebral amyloidosis(19, 20) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, in vitro binding experiments using human apoE isolated from plasma or recombinant human apoE with synthetic peptides homologous to A have shown that these two proteins can form an SDS-resistant complex with A and promote A fibril formation in vitro(21, 22, 23, 24) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These lines of evidence, together with the immunohistochemical colocalization of apoE and A in the senile plaques and its presence in the intraneuronal amyloid of neurofibrillary tangles(6) , suggest that apoE may play an active role in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting fibrillogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, immunohistochemical studies have shown that apoE is tightly associated with other types of cerebral amyloidosis, including Down syndrome related to A, hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy of Icelandic type, related to a cystatin C variant, and spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, kuru, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease that are associated with the prion amyloid(6, 7, 25) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Furthermore, apoE has been immunohistochemically identified within amyloid deposits in systemic forms of the disease such as secondary amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever related to amyloid A, immunoglobulin-related primary amyloidosis (AL), and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy due to deposition of transthyretin genetic variants(7) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Noteworthy, apoE is rarely detected in the nonfibrillar monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which may be considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	27	This widespread association of apoE with biochemically and clinically diverse types of amyloidoses suggests that apoE may participate in a general manner in the process of amyloid formation.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The 22-kDa amino-terminal domain (residues 1-191) is a stable globular structure containing the sequence that mediates low density lipoprotein-receptor binding(9, 30) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In contrast, the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment is less stable, binds to lipoproteins, and mediates lipid-free apoE tetramerization in aqueous solutions(31) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Previously, we published the finding of a tryptic fragment of apolipoprotein E corresponding to residues 270-278 in association with two amyloid A proteins(29) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our present data extend that observation.

0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	177	We propose that the apoE fragments that co-purify with AA and AL are bound to these amyloid proteins in vivo.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The remainder of the apoE molecule is cleaved by thrombin and/or other serine proteases in situ either before or after the amyloid-apoE complex is formed.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Alternatively, we cannot rule out that apoE was partially degraded during purification.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Intact apoE and apoE fragments, as determined by Western blot analysis, are present in the crude AA and AL fibril fractions before HPLC.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, after purification only the carboxyl-terminal apoE fragment co-purifies with the AA and AL amyloids.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The question of whether the apoE-amyloid association precedes tissue deposition remains to be addressed.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	183	It is likely that the initial formation of stable apoE-amyloid complexes requires the interaction of the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor through the amino-terminal domain of apoE requires lipid association, largely mediated by the carboxyl end of the molecule(31) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The interdependence of the domains of apoE is further reflected by the effect that amino acid substitutions within the amino-terminal region have on the association of apoE with diverse lipoprotein classes.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Such association is known to be mediated by the carboxyl terminus of apoE (9) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The apoE3 isoform with a Cys at position 112 preferentially binds high density lipoproteins, whereas the presence of Arg at the same position favors binding to very low density and intermediate density lipoproteins(33, 34) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	188	 A cooperation between domains unique to each apoE isoform has been postulated to explain this selective lipoprotein distribution(35) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Whether a similar mechanism can account for the higher avidity of the apoE4 isoform for A of AD remains to be tested.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	190	ApoE is capable of binding to synthetic A through a strong interaction resistant to SDS(21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	191	 A similar interaction between apoE and A of the Dutch variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a rare form of familial AD, has also been documented (36) (details of apoE-A binding will be published elsewhere).
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	192	 By using a set of truncated recombinants, the purported binding region to A has been located within the carboxyl-end of apoE between amino acids 244 and 272 (21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our findings suggest that the binding of this region to A is not specific for this peptide but rather reflects a hydrophobic interaction between apoE carboxyl end and a common conformation shared by different amyloids.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Secondary structure predictions indicate that a putative amphipathic helix with high affinity for lipids (37) is located within the region that co-purifies with amyloid peptides.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Possibly, other exchangeable apolipoproteins sharing similar amphipathic helices can also have amyloid-apolipoprotein interactions.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	196	 It is noteworthy that genetic variants of apoAI can form amyloid in certain hereditary forms of human amyloidosis (38, 39) and that SAA, the precursor of AA, is itself an apolipoprotein associated to high density lipoprotein(40) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We recently found that apoAI can bind to A and promote A fibrillogenesis in vitro.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	198	()Presumably, in the same way that there is a large number of amyloidogenic precursor proteins that can end as insoluble amyloid fibrils, there is also a group of amyloidogenic apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants that can actively participate in this process either as constituents of fibrils or as modulators of fibrillogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	199	Our finding of a higher degree of polymerization of AA and AL native peptides upon incubation with apoE together with previous work using synthetic A (22, 23, 24, 36) points to a general role of apoE in amyloidogenesis.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The molar ratios of apoE and AA used in our in vitro experiments are opposite of those found in plasma in normal conditions for apoE and SAA.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	201	 However, SAA is an acute phase reactant, and its concentration in plasma is capable of rising 1000-fold during tissue injury or inflammation(41) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	202	 AL, in turn, is derived from monoclonal light chains, which are known to have very high levels in the circulation in most of the cases.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Therefore, we believe that the concentrations that we used in vitro can resemble more closely the pathological conditions in which amyloidosis develops than the physiological levels of apoE and amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	204	ApoE may act as one of a group of pathological chaperones that promote the aggregation of amyloidogenic precursors of diverse primary structure into the -pleated sheet conformation of amyloid fibrils.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The absence of apoE and AP in the nonfibrillar, Congo red negative monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which are considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26) , suggests that apoE and AP may be essential catalysts for the modulation of the amyloid generation process.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The interaction between apoE and amyloids may also be influenced by other local acute phase reactants such as proteoglycans to which both amyloid precursors and apoE are known to bind(42, 43) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In spite of this putative widespread role of apoE in amyloid formation, it seems likely that a certain specificity exists between some of the amyloid precursors and apoE genetic isoforms.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Thus far, no preferential associations between systemic amyloidoses and apoE isoforms have been reported; however, the genetic association of AD with apoE4 and the in vitro higher avidity of this isoform for A may reflect such specificity(19, 21) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Alternatively, the apoE4 isoform may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through a different pathway unrelated to A formation or deposition.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	210	Recently it has been reported that apoE can inhibit A aggregation in vitro at concentrations similar to those found normally in biological fluids(44) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This apparent discrepancy with previous studies could be due to different experimental conditions(22, 23, 24, 36) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, it raises the intriguing possibility that apoE may have a dual effect upon fibrillogenesis in vivo depending on the local concentrations of both apoE and amyloid precursors in sites of amyloid formation.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Within physiological levels, apoE may have a protective role on amyloid formation by sequestering soluble amyloid precursors, as has been postulated for A(44) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	214	 However, A appears to be associated to other apolipoproteins (i.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	215	 apolipoprotein J) in biological fluids in vivo(45) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Yet, in tissues in which local membrane repair and lipid turnover are increased, such as after cell injury, apoE is overexpressed and can reach higher concentrations than those found normally in the circulation(10, 11, 12, 46) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Under these circumstances, apoE may have a substantially different effect upon its association with amyloid precursors.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In this pathological setting, several other factors may affect apoE behavior, such as its state of oxidation, lipid association, the presence of other amyloid/apoE binding proteins, and the stage of the amyloid process(47) .
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	219	The abnormal amyloid response in each individual will be determined finally by a complex process involving critical concentrations of amyloid precursors and a set of amyloid-associated proteins such as apoE, other apolipoproteins, AP, -antichymotrypsin (22) , and proteoglycans.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	220	 These may act in conjunction with yet undefined tissue-specific factors to modulate the conformational transition of a soluble protein into an insoluble fibril.
0.31481948.7615568.html.plaintext.txt	221	 A better understanding of these complex interactions between amyloids and the factors that modulate their formation may open novel strategies for the treatment of the systemic and cerebral amyloid-related diseases.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The interaction of apolipoprotein E (apoE) with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is an important step in the uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the liver.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	5	 ApoE interacts predominantly with heparin through the N-terminal binding site spanning the residues around 136 to 150.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this work, surface plasmon resonance analysis was employed to investigate how amphipathic -helix properties and basic residue organization in this region modulate binding of apoE to heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The apoE/heparin interaction involves a two-step process; apoE initially binds to heparin with fast association and dissociation rates, followed by a step exhibiting much slower kinetics.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance experiments using a disulfide-linked mutant, in which opening of the N-terminal helix bundle was prevented, demonstrated that there is no major secondary or tertiary structural change in apoE upon heparin binding.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutations of Lys-146, a key residue for the heparin interaction, greatly reduced the favorable free energy of binding of the first step without affecting the second step, suggesting that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Although lipid-free apoE2 tended to bind less than apoE3 and apoE4, there were no significant differences in rate and equilibrium constants of binding among the apoE isoforms in the lipidated state.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Discoidal apoE3-phospholipid complexes using a substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) showed similar binding affinity to wild type apoE3, indicating that basic residue specificity is not required for the effective binding of apoE to heparin, unlike its binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, disruption of the -helix structure in the apoE heparin binding region led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the second binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Based on these results, it seems that cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan localizes apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins to the vicinity of receptors by fast association and dissociation.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a key protein regulating lipid transport in human plasma and brain (1 to 4).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	15	 It mediates hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins as a high affinity ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, including LDLR, LDLR-related protein (LRP), and cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (5).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In the liver, HSPGs act in concert with LRP to complete the interaction of remnant particles with LRP in a process known as the HSPG-LRP pathway, in which apoE initially interacts with HSPG on the cell surface and is then transferred to the LRP for internalization (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The ability of apoE to interact with members of the LDLR family and with HSPG can also be significant for cell signaling events (7).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Binding of apoE to LRP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated migration of smooth muscle cells (8).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation by apoE is, on the other hand, mediated by its binding to HSPG (9).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In addition, the interaction of apoE with HSPG has been implicated in neuronal growth and repair and, consequently, is involved in the progression of late onset familial Alzheimer's disease (10 to 12).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	21	ApoE comprises a single polypeptide chain of 299 amino acid residues and contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222 to 299) (2, 13).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The N-terminal domain is folded into a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDLR binding region (around residues 136 to 150 in helix 4) (14, 15).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The C-terminal domain also contains amphipathic -helices that are involved in binding to lipoprotein particles (2, 16, 17).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Both the N- and C-terminal domains contain a heparin binding site (18, 19).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 136 and 147, overlapping with the LDLR binding region (20, 21), whereas the C-terminal site involves basic residues around lysine 233 (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Although both sites are functional in the separated fragments, only the N-terminal site is available for interaction in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	27	In humans, apoE is a polymorphic protein with three major isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, each differing by cysteine and arginine at positions 112 and 158 (11).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	28	 ApoE3, the most common form, contains cysteine and arginine at these positions, respectively, whereas apoE2 contains cysteine and apoE4 contains arginine at both sites.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Both apoE3 and apoE4 bind with equally high affinity to the LDLR, but apoE2 has defective binding to the LDLR and is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (23).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	30	 ApoE4 is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease and is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (3, 24, 25).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	31	A cluster of arginine and lysine residues located on the polar face of the fourth amphipathic -helix in the N-terminal bundle represents the binding site for cell-surface receptors (2).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Despite the apparent accessibility of these basic residues, interaction of apoE with lipid is necessary for its high affinity binding to the LDLR (26).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Recent studies indicate that lipid binding induces opening of the helix bundle in the N-terminal domain (27, 28); this increases exposure of lysines 143 and 146 to the aqueous phase and thereby enhances interaction with acidic elements of the LDLR (29).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Disruption of the amphipathic -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 abolishes LDLR binding, indicating that this structural motif in apoE is critical for function (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In contrast to binding to the LDLR, the stringency for binding of apoE to the LRP or HSPG appears to be less severe.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Lipid association of apoE is not required for binding to the LRP (31) or HSPG (22, 32), although the same apoE domain spanning residues 136 to 150 is involved in the binding (21, 33).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	37	 ApoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding activity ( < 2% of normal apoE3 activity) has significant binding activity to LRP (40 to 50% of apoE3) (23) and HSPG (50 to 90% of apoE3) (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The detailed molecular features that control high affinity binding of apoE to the LRP and HSPG are not yet defined fully.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	39	Previously, we have characterized the effect of point mutations of the basic residues present in the heparin binding sites on the equilibrium parameters defining interaction of apoE with heparin (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To predict the distribution of apoE to different receptors, such as LDLR, LRP, and HSPG, however, it is also important to establish the kinetics of apoE-receptor association and dissociation because receptor/ligand interactions at the cell surface do not occur at equilibrium.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were employed to determine the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of engineered apoE molecules in the lipid-free and lipidated states with heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Using this approach, we provide novel insights into the mechanism of apoE/heparin interaction.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	43	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Materials 1,2-Dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was purchased from Avanti%20Polar%20Lipids">Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL), and stock solutions were stored in chloroform:methanol (2:1) under nitrogen at  to 20  degrees C.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant was dialyzed from 6 M guanidine HCl solution to maintain interhelical disulfide bonding (27).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	56	 DMPC complexes with the apoE3 22-kDa variants were prepared as described previously (29).

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	58	 A streptavidin SA sensor chip was pretreated with three consecutive 5- microl injections of 50 mM NaOH in 1 M NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound contaminants.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	59	 For immobilization of heparin on a SA chip, an injection of biotinylated heparin (10  microg/ml) in Tris buffer was made at a flow rate of 5  microl/min followed by a 10- microl injection of 2 M NaCl.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Typically, 30 to 200 resonance units of heparin were immobilized, and the effects of mass transport were not significant because of the low surface density of ligand (35).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	61	 An untreated flow cell was used as a control.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	62	 For kinetic measurement of apoE interaction with heparin, a 30- microl injection of the apoE sample was passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10  microl/min.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	63	 At the end of the sample plug, the same buffer was passed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	64	 After 3 min of dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 10- microl pulse of 2 M NaCl.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The resultant sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAevaluation software (version 4.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The response curves of various analyte concentrations were globally fitted to either the 1:1 Langmuir model or the two-state binding model described by the following equation (36,37),.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	67	 1) where the equilibrium constants of each binding step are K1 = ka1/kd1 and K2 = ka2/kd2, and the overall equilibrium binding constant is calculated as KA = K1(1 + K2) and Kd = 1/KA.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In this model, the analyte (A) binds to the ligand (B) to form an initial complex (AB) and then undergoes subsequent binding or conformational change to form a more stable complex (ABx).

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Because binding equilibrium was achieved during the injection of the 10- and 12-kDa fragments of apoE, we determined binding isotherms from the relationship between the equilibrium binding response (Req) and protein concentration (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These isotherms were similar to those obtained using heparin-Sepharose gel (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The kinetic data were not fitted well by a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, as indicated by the large value of the goodness of fit (2 = 100) (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	96	4) was obtained using a two-state binding model, indicating that binding of apoE to heparin involves either a sequential two-step process or some conformational change (36, 37).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The response curve of heparin binding of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment also showed two-state binding kinetics (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Such an effect of contact time on dissociation rate was not seen in the apoE 10-kDa binding to heparin, because the contribution of the second binding step to the overall process was very small (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	124	 SPR sensorgrams of heparin binding of this mutant still exhibited two-state binding kinetics (data not shown), indicating that a conformational change, such as the opening of the helix bundle, was not involved in the two-state binding for the apoE/heparin interaction.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	145	 7A, full-length apoE2 exhibited a somewhat slower first association rate and higher Kd value than full-length apoE3.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	151	  Effects of Substitution of Basic Residues and Disruption of -Helical Structure in the N-terminal Heparin Binding Site on Binding Kinetics of Lipidated ApoE Previously, we have determined the structural requirements in the apoE receptor binding domain for effective binding to the LDLR by substituting basic residues or disrupting -helical structure in this region (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	152	 To examine the possibility that similar requirements are necessary for heparin binding, we used two apoE3 22-kDa mutants for SPR measurements.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	153	 The first was a (K143R/K146R) mutant in which the conservative substitution of two lysines with arginines decreases the affinity for the LDLR to 30% of the WT value.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The second was a (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant in which the exchange of lysines and leucines (which disrupts the -helical structure spanning residues 140 to 150 without altering the net charge) eliminates binding to the LDLR (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Because lipid association is required for the high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR (26), we used discoidal complexes of apoE 22-kDa fragments for SPR measurements to compare their LDLR binding abilities.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The apoE3 22-kDa fragment-DMPC discoidal complex displayed a second order higher first association rate constant than the lipid-free protein, resulting in much higher affinity binding to heparin (cf.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Among apoE isoforms complexed with DMPC, there was no significant difference in association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium affinity (Table II).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The mutation (K143R/K146R) had no effect on the kinetics and affinity for binding to heparin, indicating that charge specificity of basic residues is not required for effective binding to heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In contrast, the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant exhibited much lower responses in heparin binding than the WT apoE3 22-kDa fragment in the lipidated state (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	160	 8), suggesting that the amphipathic nature of the -helix spanning residues 140 to 150 is critical for the heparin binding of apoE.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Interestingly, this mutation led to an increased favorable free energy of binding in the second step as well as a decrease in free energy of the first step (Fig.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The binding of apoE to heparin has been studied extensively (18 to 21), and we have recently defined the dominant role of the N-terminal site (residues 136 to 150) in the heparin binding of both lipid-free and lipid-associated apoE (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, the structural requirements in this region, such as the basic residue organization and the amphipathic nature of -helix for the high affinity interaction of apoE with heparin as opposed to the LDLR, have not been defined yet.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In the present study, we characterized the kinetics of the interaction with heparin for apoE isoforms and various mutants lacking effective LDLR binding affinity.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Knowledge of the association and dissociation rate constants obtained here is relevant to the understanding events at a cell surface, because many receptor/ligand interactions do not occur at equilibrium.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	176	Two-step Mechanism of Binding of ApoE to Heparin Our SPR data indicate that the binding of apoE to heparin is a two-state process involving sequential binding and/or a conformational change.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It is known that, when a protein binds to heparin, it can induce a change in conformation within heparin and/or the protein (43).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	178	 For the interaction between antithrombin and heparin, the initial interaction induces a conformational change in antithrombin that enables additional interactions between antithrombin and heparin, resulting in stronger binding (44).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	179	 There is also evidence that the relatively flexible 2-sulfoiduronic acid residue in heparin can change its conformation upon protein binding, resulting in a better fit and enhanced binding (43).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, our CD measurements for the apoE/heparin mixture demonstrated that heparin binding does not induce a change in the secondary structure of apoE (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Taken together with the SPR data for the triple interhelical disulfide-linked apoE4 22-kDa mutant showing two-state binding to heparin, it appears that the two-state apoE/heparin interaction observed in SPR measurements is not due to any major conformational change in apoE upon heparin binding.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	182	The most dominant type of interaction between heparin and proteins is ionic; clusters of basic residues on proteins form ion pairs with spatially defined acidic groups in heparin (45).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In fact, molecular modeling for the interaction between the heparin binding site of apoE and heparin fragment suggested that eight polar residues including Lys-146 directly contact with sulfate or carboxyl groups on the heparin chain (21).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Thus, the large reductions in the association rate and favorable free energy in the first binding step for Lys-146 mutants (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	185	 6) are consistent with the first step involving fast electrostatic interaction between basic residues in apoE and acidic groups in heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In addition, analysis of the dependence of Kd values on sodium chloride concentration (data not shown) using the protein/polyelectrolyte interaction theory (46) indicated that there are 3.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	187	7 charged residues, respectively, involved in the electrostatic component of the overall and the first binding process in the apoE/heparin interaction.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The similarity in these two values also supports the idea that electrostatic interaction is involved in the first binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	189	Besides the ionic interaction, it is known that there is a significant contribution to the binding to heparin by nonionic interactions such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions in some cases (45).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In fact, molecular modeling of the apoE/heparin interaction predicts formation of hydrogen bonding between some residues such as Lys-143 in apoE and heparin, and also hydrophobic interaction between the shallow groove of the -helix of apoE and the saccharide chains of heparin (21).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In this regard, the significant increase in the contribution of the second step to the free energy of binding observed for the (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) mutant (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	192	 9), in which disruption of the amphipathic -helix in the heparin binding region destabilizes the N-terminal helix bundle and exposes the hydrophobic surface (30), implies that hydrophobic interaction between apoE and heparin contributes to the second binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In addition, we found that SPR data of the interaction of brain natriuretic peptide with heparin, in which the major contribution to the free energy of binding comes from hydrogen bonding interaction (47) displayed two-state binding, and the first binding step contributed most of the overall free energy of binding (data not shown).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This suggests that hydrogen bonding may be involved mostly in the first binding step.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	195	Structural Requirements in the Receptor Binding Region of ApoE for Heparin Interaction Although lipid association is required for high affinity binding of apoE to the LDLR (26), lipid-free apoE can bind effectively to heparin (Table I).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In addition, apoE2 that is highly defective in LDLR binding (23) exhibited similar heparin binding activity to apoE3 in both lipid-free and lipidated states (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These results are consistent with previous observations that the requirements for the high affinity binding of apoE to HSPG/heparin are less stringent than for binding to the LDLR (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	198	 It has been suggested that the multiple basic residues in the receptor binding region (residues 136 to 150) of apoE are required to have a particular orientation for optimal binding to the LDLR (48).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Indeed, comparison of the structure of residues 135 to 151 between lipid-free and lipid-associated apoE showed a significantly different curvature and that the basic residues are less scattered, forming a better aligned and more elongated hydrophilic surface in the lipidated form (49, 50).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In addition, our nuclear magnetic resonance studies (29, 51) demonstrated that lipid interaction increases positive electrostatic potential around lysines 143 and 146 and that these effects are much less in apoE2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Taken together, it appears that the enhanced electrostatic potential around residues 136 to 150 in apoE, required for the interaction with the LDLR, is not necessary for the high affinity binding to heparin.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	202	Previous studies of the relative strengths of heparin binding of arginine and lysine demonstrated that the former binds 2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Indeed, we found from SPR measurements that the lipid-free substitution mutant (K143R/K146R) displayed a 2.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	204	6 times higher affinity to heparin than WT (data not shown).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	205	 However, as shown in Table II, this double substitution of lysines with arginines had no effect on the kinetics and affinity of the binding of lipidated apoE to heparin, although this mutant exhibits much reduced binding affinity to the LDLR (30).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	206	 It follows that there is no preference between lysine and arginine at these positions for the heparin binding of lipid-associated apoE.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Disruption of the -helical structure in region 140 to 150 by the mutation (L141K/K143L/K146L/L148K) greatly affected the kinetics of binding to heparin (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	208	 8 and Table II), but this mutant still displayed overall heparin binding affinity similar to WT (Table II).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This suggests that an amphipathic -helical structural motif in the receptor binding region of apoE is not critical for the effective binding to heparin; this is in contrast to the situation with LDLR binding.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Such somewhat surprising results may arise because the appropriate arrangement of basic residues required for the interaction with heparin is still maintained in the discoidal complex of this mutant.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Presumably, cooperative binding through multiple copies of the heparin binding sites of apoE molecules is important in determining the heparin binding ability of apoE bound to lipid particles (22).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	212	Implications for the Sequestration Role of HSPG in Remnant Lipoprotein Metabolism Our SPR kinetic data for the apoE/heparin interaction provide novel insights into the mechanism of the HSPG-LRP pathway for remnant lipoprotein uptake by cells (Fig.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In this pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then transfer to the LRP for internalization (6).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Because only limited kinetic parameters for the apoE/LRP interaction are available (33), we can only compare our kinetic parameters of binding of lipidated apoE to heparin with those to the related LDLR (53, 54).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Because of the fast association of lipidated apoE in the first binding step to heparin through long range and nondirectional ionic interactions (Table II), it follows that apoE-enriched remnant particles can be captured rapidly by the abundant HSPG on the cell surface.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Fast dissociation in this step is likely to allow a rapid transfer of remnant particles to the LRP associated closely with HSPG (55).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The LRP could then retain the remnant particles at the cell surface until endocytosis occurs because of the very slow dissociation rate of the apoE-receptor complex (10 to 5 s to 1) (53).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Such a process would be more efficient than direct binding of remnant particles in solution to the LRP, because remnant particles concentrated on the cell surface could diffuse in two dimensions by rapidly exchanging between HSPG binding sites until they collide with the LRP to form the LRP-remnant particle complex.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This lateral diffusion on the cell surface is reminiscent of the "scooting mode" proposed for the interfacial reaction of phospholipases (56).
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is also possible that some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization without LRP involvement.

0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The apoE-enriched remnant lipoproteins are first captured through the fast association of apoE with cell-surface HSPG.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Because of the fast dissociation rate of this interaction, remnant lipoproteins are rapidly transferred to the LRP to form a stable complex (characterized by slow dissociation) for endocytosis.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Some initial complexes of HSPG-remnant particle would undergo the second binding step, forming a more stable complex for internalization.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	226	  In summary, we have characterized the kinetics and affinity of the interaction of apoE with heparin using SPR.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Our data show that the binding of apoE to heparin is a two-step process, the fast initial binding involving a polar interaction followed by relatively slow nonpolar interaction.
0.3398514.15583000.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We propose that the fast association and dissociation process in the apoE/HSPG interaction plays a role in the HSPG-LRP pathway, in which remnant lipoproteins are rapidly captured by HSPG and then transferred to the LRP to form a stable complex for internalization.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	4	In homozygous -thalassemia, the organ damage is mainly attributed to excessive iron deposition through the formation of oxygen free radicals.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Despite appropriate transfusion and chelation therapy and low ferritin levels, patients still develop organ failure, heart failure being the main cause of death.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This study was designed to determine whether the decreased antioxidant activity of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele could represent a genetic risk factor for the development of left ventricular failure (LVF) in -thalassemia homozygotes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A total of 251 Greek -thalassemia homozygotes were studied.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Patients were divided in three groups: group A (n = 151) with no cardiac impairment, group C (n = 47) with LVF, and 53 patients with LV dilatation and normal LV systolic function constituted the group B.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	9	 DNA was obtained from all patients, and the polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the polymorphism at the APOE locus.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The APOE allele frequencies were compared with those of a Greek control sample of 216 healthy blood donors.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Patients with no cardiac impairment had an APOE 4 allele frequency (7.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	16	    INTRODUCTION Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion References.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	17	THE HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES are the most common monogenic disorders in the world population, and they were the first diseases to be analyzed by recombinant DNA technology.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	18	1-3 More is known about their molecular pathology than any other genetic disease, and it has been possible to trace almost all of the diverse pathophysiologic features back to primary molecular defects in single genes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	19	4 In monogenic disorders, most of the phenotypic variability is expected to be due to allelic heterogeneity, although siblings with the same genotype can show big phenotypic differences.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The molecular basis of such difference in clinical expression is not yet fully understood.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	21	Homozygous -thalassemia is characterized by severe hemolytic anemia associated with chronic tissue damage, disease- or treatment-related organ failure and premature death.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	22	Heart failure remains the main cause of death and is traditionally attributed to iron overload because of regular transfusions, increased iron intestinal absorption, and ineffective erythropoiesis during the life span of the patients.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	23	5,6 During the last two decades, a striking improvement in life quality and life expectancy has been observed, mainly due to proper transfusion and effective chelation therapy to prevent secondary hemosiderosis.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	24	Regular chelation therapy with deferoxamine mesylate, a naturally occurring trihydroxamic acid produced by Streptomyces pilosus, increases urinary and fecal iron excretion, resulting in amelioration of cardiac dysfunction8,9 and increased survival.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	25	7 Although many patients benefit from this therapy, others continue to have organ dysfunction and die, sometimes despite intensive treatment with deferoxamine.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	26	10 It can thus be hypothesized that either the deferoxamine therapy is not effective in those patients, or they have reduced defense mechanisms against the iron overload.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The present study was designed to test the hypothesis whether a postulated genetically determined decreased antioxidant (and iron binding) activity in some patients with homozygous -thalassemia could represent an independent risk factor for the development of heart failure.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	28	Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a plasma protein with known functions in cholesterol transport and metabolism and Alzheimer's disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	29	11,12 The APOE gene is located on chromosome 19, and a polymorphism exists at the APOE locus with the three most common alleles designated 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to three isoforms of the apoE protein.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	30	13 It was recently shown that apoE at physiologic levels has isoform-specific effects in protecting a rat neuronal cell line from oxidative cell death, and that these effects correlated with apoE's antioxidant activity in in vitro assays (ranked E2 > E3 > E4).
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	31	14 The demonstrated metal binding ability (including iron) of apoE was postulated to be one mechanism accounting for its antioxidant properties.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	32	14 We hypothesized that a decreased antioxidant activity of apoE4 in -thalassemia homozygotes might be a genetic risk factor for the development of left ventricular failure (LVF).
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We tested our hypothesis by comparing the frequency of APOE allele 4 in -thalassemia major patients divided into three groups according to their cardiac status with the 4 frequency in a Greek control sample.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	34	    MATERIALS AND METHODS Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion References Subjects.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	35	   The subjects were 251 -thalassemia major patients of Greek origin (117 men and 134 women), followed systematically by three major thalassemia treatment units in the Athens area belonging to the public health system.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Transfusion therapy had started in all patients before the age of 5 years.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Each patient was receiving blood transfusions every 15 to 25 days to maintain a hemoglobin level above 9 g/dL during all of the years of follow-up.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	38	 All patients were receiving chelation therapy with subcutaneous deferoxamine.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The therapy had been initiated in each patient after the serum ferritin level had reached 2,000 ng/mL.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To evaluate the transfusion therapy and the hemosiderosis level, we obtained the mean pretransfusion hemoglobin level and mean serum ferritin level in each patient over the last 2 and 5 years of follow-up, respectively.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Serum ferritin was measured two times per year in each patient by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (Abbott, Chicago, IL), and values were rounded off to the nearest 10.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	42	Clinical and laboratory cardiac evaluation included medical history, clinical examination, electrocardiographic (ECG), as well as echocardiographic studies.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The echocardiographic examination was performed as follows: two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained using instruments with a 3-MHZ transducer.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A two-dimensional study was first performed to identify the overall cardiac anatomy and motion.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Long-axis and parasternal short-axis views at the midventricular level were used to derive the following M-mode measurements: left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, left atrial and right ventricular cavity dimensions, thickness of interventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	46	15 Four- and two-chamber apical views were used to estimate ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, which were calculated using the discs method.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	47	16 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated as [(end-diastolic volume minus end-systolic volume) divided by end-diastolic volume] multiplied by 100.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	48	The patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of heart disease based on clinical evaluation and echocardiographic findings.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Group A patients had no symptoms or signs of heart failure, and their echocardiographic study was within normal limits.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Group C patients had symptoms and signs of LVF and concomitant echocardiographic findings.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These patients exhibited dyspnea on exertion (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class I-IV) and fulfilled at least two major Framingham criteria for heart failure diagnosis.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Finally, patients in group B were asymptomatic, but exhibited LV dilatation (LV end diastolic diameter index [LVEDDI] higher than 30 mm/m2) without left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LV fractional shortening [FS] higher than 28%), as assessed echocardiographically.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Patients in this group did not receive treatment.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	54	Another type of heart failure in -thalassemia major is associated with right ventricular dilatation.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Patients of this kind were excluded from the study, as right ventricular failure in -thalassemia major is due to different pathophysiologic reasons.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	56	   Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood samples by a salting out procedure.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	57	19 Genotyping of polymorphic APOE alleles was done after polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA, digestion with Hha I restriction enzyme, and agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	58	20,21 The control sample for which data on APOE genotype were available consisted of a random sample of 216 voluntary, healthy Greek blood donors.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	59	22 The blood donors were 146 men and 70 women, and the mean age was 35.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	60	6 years (range, 19 to 64 years).
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	61	   We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple groups to assess differences regarding echocardiographic measurements between the three patient groups and the 2 test to compare the 4 allele frequency in the different patient groups with that of the population controls.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	63	From the 251 patients studied, 151 belonged to group A, 53 to group B, and 47 to group C.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Three cases were excluded from the study, as they presented a clinical picture of congestive heart failure and echocardiographic findings of profound right ventricular dilatation, good LV function, and pulmonary hypertension at the Doppler study.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The APOE 3 allele had the highest frequency in all three patient groups, while the 2 allele frequency of 5.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	77	4% in group C does not show any statistical difference from the control group.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The APOE 4 allele frequency in -thalassemia homozygotes without cardiac impairment (7.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	79	9%) was not different from the frequency in population controls (6.

0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	90	The severity of iron toxicity in -thalassemia major seems to be related to the magnitude of the body iron burden.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	91	23,24 The exact mechanism of iron overload toxicity has been uncertain for many years.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Via the iron-driven Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, the nontransferrin plasma iron, in its bivalent or trivalent form, has a high toxicity through the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	93	25 This leads to peroxidative damage of membrane lipids and proteins.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Imbalance between production of oxygen free radicals and antioxidant defense mechanisms can result in oxidative stress and human disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	95	26 In the heart, the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant mechanisms is manifested as impaired function of the mitochondrial inner-membrane respiratory chain resulting in abnormal energy metabolism expressed clinically with fatal cardiomyopathy.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Apart from iron overload, it has been recently shown by our group that myocarditis appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of LVF in a certain number of patients with homozygous -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	97	27 As shown in animal models, oxygen free radicals may also contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious myocarditis.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	98	In the present study, we categorized the patients in three groups according to the severity of heart disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The normal cases of group A and the severely affected cases of group C had clear clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and were easily distinguished.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Patients of group B were characterized by LV dilatation and good LV function.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In these cases, LV and left atrial (LA) dilatation could possibly represent the first step of LV dysfunction without overt LV decreased contractility, or a compensatory mechanism due to anemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Some of these patients will eventually develop LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	103	The results of the functional polymorphism at the APOE locus in our study suggest that the 4 allele may be a genetic risk factor for the development of LVF (and other organ damage) in homozygous -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	104	 It represents the first demonstration of a genetic factor unlinked to the  globin gene cluster contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The 4 allele could represent a predictive marker for development of LVF in patients with -thalassemia major and LV dilatation (our patient group B), suggesting a closer follow-up of such patients.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	106	 As the APOE 4 frequency was found in only 12.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	107	8% of patients with homozygous -thalassemia and LVF, it is obvious that other genetic and environmental factors, as for instance, the number of transfusions, iron overload, chelation therapy, and viral myocardial inflammation, play a role in the development of organ damage.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The fact that patients in groups B and C, as shown in Table 1, did not have either higher ferritin levels or were transfused more inadequately than those without cardiac impairment, supports the role of APOE 4 allele as a genetic risk factor for LVF development.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Furthermore, some patients of group A with 4 allele could still develop LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Additional evidence for the relationship between the 4 allele and heart disease comes from an analysis of patients homozygous for the 4 allele, of whom three had LVF and one LV dilatation, but numbers in this category are small.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The increase in the 4 allele frequency among patients with cardiac disease comes with a reduction in 3 rather than 2 allele frequency, but the 2 allele frequency is already very low in the Greek population,22 and other factors may influence the level of this allele.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	112	As the APOE 4 allele was found in patients of advanced age with no cardiac impairment, the presence of the 4 allele does not guarantee the development of LVF in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In addition, as more than 85% of patients with LVF do not carry the 4 allele, this is neither a necessary prerequisite for the development of LVF.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	114	 This is equivalent to the association of APOE 4 with Alzheimer's disease, where the association has been confirmed in almost 100 studies around the world.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	115	30 A consensus statement on APOE genotyping in Alzheimer's disease concluded that APOE genotyping can be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, but that prospective investigations of dementia as a function of APOE genotype are needed,31 and something similar might apply to -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	116	Allelic variation at the APOE locus has been studied in many populations.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Significant differences have been observed between Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese, and black races.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Also among Caucasian populations there is a significant variation in the allele frequencies.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	119	32 Average allele frequencies from Caucasians show an 4 allele frequency of 15.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The very low 4 frequency in the Greek population22 is in agreement with the gradient found for the frequency of this allele in Europe, and is supported by a similar low frequency (7.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	121	33 Our finding of an association between the APOE 4 allele and LVF in Greek -thalassemia homozygotes now needs confirmation from other populations using appropriate population controls.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	122	The well-known isoform-specific influence of apoE on plasma cholesterol level and atherosclerosis32 cannot explain the association found between APOE allele 4 and LVF in -thalassemia homozygotes, as atherosclerosis is not a general feature of the pathophysiology of the disorder.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	123	It is recognized now that the severity of a monogenic disorder may be modified by a second locus, depending on the genetic background.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	124	34 Any genes involved in the pathogenic pathway represent candidate modifier genes.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	125	35 The boundaries between monogenic and polygenic disorders might not always be so clear-cut as previously thought,34 as more genes and gene interactions become known from the progress of the Human Genome Project.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	126	The finding of an increased frequency of APOE 4 allele in -thalassemia homozygotes with LVF provides additional evidence to the theory of oxygen free radicals as contributing to the organ damage, due to the recently demonstrated antioxidant and iron binding activity of apoE.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	127	14 This suggests that several other genetic loci could be of potential relevance to the oxidative damage of organs in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Such loci include genes modulating genesis of oxygen free radicals (ie, cytochrome C oxidase), genes for scavenger enzymes (superoxide dismutases, catalase), genes regulating mitochondrial DNA replication, structural genes for membrane lipoproteins, and genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	129	36 It is noteworthy that mutant mice lacking the Mn-superoxide dismutase enzyme suffer neonatal lethality due to dilated cardiomyopathy.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	130	37 Other functional polymorphisms in such genes could be examined for association with organ failure in -thalassemia.
0.30754375.9787187.html.plaintext.txt	131	 It is also believed that genetic susceptibility for a majority of common diseases will be associated with relatively common alleles of one or several loci.

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	10	Missense mutations associated with early onsetAlzheimer's disease (AD) have been discovered in two related genes termed presenilin I on chromosome 14 (1 ) and presenilin II on chromosome 1 (2 ,3 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	17	Fibroblasts, transformed lymphoblasts or peripheral blood samples were obtained from at least one affected member of 60 kindreds with multiple (>3) family members affected by FAD that were ascertained through the familial Alzheimer's disease registry at the University of Toronto, through clinics at the University of Florence and the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, from French University Hospitals through the National INSERM network of France, and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank and the NIA sponsored repository at the Coriell Institute.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Diagnosis of AD in affected members used the NINDS-ADRDA criteria or the similar CERAD criteria.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutations in the PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) genes had previously been excluded in the majority of these pedigrees by sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products corresponding to the PS-1 gene and genomic PCR products corresponding to exons 16 and 17 of [beta]APP.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	20	Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of RT-PCR products corresponding to the ORF of PS-2 in these 60 FAD pedigrees failed to uncover any additional mutations beyond the two initial mutations (Asn141Ile mutation in three related kindreds of Volga-German origin, and the Met239Val mutation in the FLO10 pedigree of Italian origin) previously reported in this data set (2 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Specific screening just for the Asn141Ile and Met239Val mutations in a supplemental set of genomic DNA samples from affected probands of 81 Swedish FAD pedigrees also failed to identify further instances of either mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, although no pathogenic nucleotide sequence differences were observed, four `silent' nucleotide substitutions were detected (T - >  C at 626 bp/codon 23; C - >  T at 806 bp/codon 147; C - >  T at 1571 bp/codon 402; and G - >  A at 1670 bp/codon 435-sequence numbering from Accession no.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All of these substitutions occurred at the third nucleotide position of a codon, and would therefore be predicted not to cause a change in the amino acid sequence.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	24	 A fifth sequence variant-the variable presence of nucleotides 1338-1340 encoding the Glu325 residuewas found in transcripts from most tissues.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Transcripts with and without nucleotides 1338-1340, which reflects the use of an alternate splice donor sequence, were of approximately equal abundance in brain, fibroblasts and leukocytes.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	26	During the investigation of the PS-2 gene in several newly ascertained members of the FLO10 pedigree segregating the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, we identified an additional carrier of this mutation (subject III-20 in Table 1 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Surprisingly, this subject was aged 87 years and had had no evidence for cognitive or memory impairment on serial follow-up over several years until age 84 years when she was noted to become mildly demented, and is now profoundly demented (Mini Mental Status Examination score 4/30) with clinical features that sustain a diagnosis of probable AD by the NINDS-ADRDA criteria.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 ).

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	38	 With the exception of subject III-39, whose genotypes at PS-2 and ApoE are unknown because no biological samples are available, all affected subjects carried the PS-2 Met239Val mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	39	Although the large cadre of FAD pedigrees reported here does not represent an unbiased survey, the paucity of missense mutations in the PS-2 gene amongst FAD pedigrees in our data set suggests that, in contrast to mutations in the ORF of PS-1, mutations in the ORF of this gene are a rare cause of FAD, at least in Caucasian populations.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	43	 First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist.

0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	46	The age of symptom onset or current age of PS-2 mutation carriers are displayed along with each subject's ApoE genotype.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	47	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, analysis of a larger data set by T.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation).
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	55	 First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	57	 other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The nature of these other factors remains to be determined.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool.
0.31518275.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	60	Subjects with familially clustered Alzheimer's disease (as defined by the occurrence of at least three first or second degree relatives with AD) were recruited from patients referred for the investigation of dementia at the University of Toronto, University of Florence, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, the Huddinge Hospital of the Karolinska Institute, and French University Hospitals.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, July 14, 2004.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is a cholesterol transporter that is widely expressed throughout the body.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Outside the central nervous system (CNS), ABCA1 functions in the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), where it mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Deficiency of ABCA1 results in lack of circulating HDL and greatly reduced levels of apoA-I.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	7	 ABCA1 is also expressed in cells within the CNS, but its roles in brain lipid metabolism are not yet fully understood.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In the brain, glia synthesize the apolipoproteins involved in CNS lipid metabolism.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is required for cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and plays a key role in facilitating cholesterol efflux to apoE, which is the major apolipoprotein in the brain.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In both astrocytes and microglia, ABCA1 deficiency reduces lipid efflux to exogenous apoE.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The impaired ability to efflux lipids in ABCA1-/- glia results in lipid accumulation in both astrocytes and microglia under normal culture conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Additionally, apoE secretion is compromised in ABCA1-/- astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In vivo, deficiency of ABCA1 results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in whole brain, and a 75-80% decrease in apoE levels in hippocampus and striatum.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Additionally, the effect of ABCA1 on apoE is selective, as apoJ levels are unchanged in brains of ABCA1-/- mice.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Taken together, these results show that glial ABCA1 is a key influence on apoE metabolism in the CNS.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   ABCA1 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters that transport substrates across membranes (1-3).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A major biochemical function of ABCA1 is to transport cholesterol and phospholipids from the plasma membrane of peripheral cells to lipid-free or lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) during reverse cholesterol transport (1), a process that constitutes an initial step in the biogenesis of high density lipoproteins (HDL)1 in the peripheral circulation.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Mutation of one ABCA1 allele causes familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FHA), a mild disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by reduced plasma HDL levels (4).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutation of both alleles of ABCA1 results in Tangier Disease (TD), which is characterized by a nearly complete absence of plasma HDL, deposition of intracellular cholesterol esters, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (4-6).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Conversely, overexpression of ABCA1 in mice increases plasma HDL and protects against atherosclerosis (7-9).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	21	ABCA1 is abundant in liver and macrophages, where its expression is induced by agonists of the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) pathways (10-16).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	22	 ABCA1 is also expressed in both glia and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is particularly abundant in Purkinje cells and in large pyramidal cortical neurons (10, 17, 18).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Similar to non-CNS cells, ABCA1 is induced by LXR/RXR stimulation in primary neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (18-20).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	24	The importance of lipid homeostasis in the CNS is underscored by the fact that the brain is the most cholesterol-rich organ in the body, and contains 25% of total body cholesterol in only 2% of the total body weight (21).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nearly all brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ, as quantitative analyses show that essentially no cholesterol crosses the blood-brain barrier (21).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In contrast, the brain cannot degrade cholesterol, and excess cholesterol must be delivered to the peripheral circulation for eventual excretion via the liver.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Approximately 6-7 mg of cholesterol leaves the human brain each day after conversion to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which easily traverses the blood-brain barrier (22-24).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	28	Glial cells play crucial roles in regulating lipid homeostasis in the CNS.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Astrocytes and microglia are the cells within the CNS that synthesize and secrete apolipoproteins that transport lipids within the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (25-27).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major apolipoprotein in the brain, and is also a component of several lipoproteins in the peripheral circulation including HDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons (28-30).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In humans, apoE exists as one of three allelic variants that contain either a cysteine or arginine residue at amino acids 112 and 158 (31).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Liver transplantation experiments in humans have shown that the allelic variant of apoE in plasma is converted to that of the donor, whereas apoE in the CSF retains the allelic identity of the recipient, illustrating that CNS and non-CNS apoE pools are synthesized independently (32).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Additionally, brain perfusion experiments in guinea pigs have shown that radiolabeled apoE administered into the peripheral circulation demonstrates very low blood-to-brain transport (33), providing additional support for independent regulation of CNS and non-CNS apoE pools.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	34	 ApoJ is a second major CNS lipoprotein that, unlike apoE, easily traverses the blood-brain barrier and associates with HDL in the periphery (26, 33, 34).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	35	 ApoE and apoJ are synthesized and secreted from astrocytes and microglia, and expression of both apoE and apoJ are induced in response to CNS injury or disease (24, 26).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	36	 ApoE is thought to coordinate the mobilization and redistribution of cholesterol in the repair and maintenance of neuronal membranes and myelin (35-37), whereas apoJ may function as a cytoprotective extracellular chaperone (38).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In contrast to apoE and apoJ, apoA-I is primarily taken up into the brain from outside the CNS, and is believed to be involved in the maturation of lipoprotein particles in the CSF (26, 39).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	38	In 1993, apoE was discovered to be an important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a finding that has now been replicated in over 100 studies.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Inheritance of apoE4 increases the risk of AD in a dosage-specific manner and may act by decreasing the age of onset of AD (40, 41).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In contrast, inheritance of apoE2 appears to protect from AD and is associated with a later age of onset (42).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain how apoE participates in the pathogenesis of AD, including roles for apoE in the formation, deposition, or clearance of the A peptides that constitute amyloid plaques (43-51).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	42	 For example, apoE binds A in vivo and is required for amyloid deposition (50-53).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Furthermore, apoE affects deposition of A in an isoform-specific manner, such that mice expressing human apoE4 develop at least 2.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	44	5-fold more A deposits than mice expressing human apoE3 per unit area (45, 49, 53, 54).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Interestingly, replacement of the murine apoE with any of the human apoE isoforms completely suppresses A deposition compared with wild-type mice expressing endogenous murine apoE (49, 55), suggesting that distinctions between human and murine apoE may play important roles in A deposition and/or clearance.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Compared with apoE, the role of apoJ in AD is less well understood, although it is known that apoJ also binds A and has been suggested to play a major role in transporting A across the blood-brain barrier (33, 34).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	47	Both ABCA1 and apoE have been shown to be induced in response to LXR/RXR stimulation (15, 16, 20, 56, 57) and to be repressed by ZN202 (58) in peripheral macrophages.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Previous work has demonstrated that apoE is a robust acceptor of lipids from ABCA1 (59, 60), raising the question of whether ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux may play important roles in the brain where apoE is a predominant apolipoprotein.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Furthermore, antisense inhibition of ABCA1 has been observed to inhibit the secretion of apoE from monocyte-derived macrophages (61), raising a second question of whether ABCA1 may also regulate apoE synthesis or secretion in other apoE-producing cells such as astrocytes or microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	50	To address these two questions, we sought to determine the relationship between ABCA1, cholesterol efflux and apoE metabolism specifically in glia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In this study, we report that ABCA1-deficient primary astrocytes and microglia are impaired in their ability to efflux lipids to exogenous apoE, which results in lipid accumulation under normal culture conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Furthermore, lack of ABCA1 expression decreases apoE secretion from glial cells in vitro.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In vivo, this impairment of apoE secretion by astrocytes and microglia results in a decrease in apoE levels by 65% in whole brain lysates of ABCA1-deficient mice, with hippocampus and striatum being the most severely affected regions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Our observations show that ABCA1 plays key roles in cholesterol transport and apoE metabolism in the CNS.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	251	 To address this possibility, apoE levels were compared between total brain extracts prepared from age- and sex-matched wild-type and apoA-I-deficient mice, a model characterized by absent HDL and apoA-I.

0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	258	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The identification of ABCA1 as an essential protein for the production of HDL has generated great interest in understanding ABCA1 function, particularly in tissues such as the liver and macrophages that are relevant to HDL metabolism and atherosclerosis.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	259	 However, the nearly ubiquitous expression of ABCA1 suggests that it may also play roles in lipid transport in other cell types and tissues.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Lipid metabolism in the CNS is largely independent of that outside the CNS, although there are several points of intersection that may be highly relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	261	In this study, we provide evidence that lack of glial ABCA1 activity results in a 65% decrease in apoE levels in vivo, which is likely due to reduced apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia and a diminished pool of intracellular apoE in microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Additionally, we show that ABCA1 facilitates cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE in primary astrocytes and microglia, as efflux is reduced in the absence of ABCA1 in both cell types.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, both astrocytes and microglia may also contain ABCA1-independent pathways to efflux cholesterol to apoE, as some residual efflux remains in ABCA1-/- cells.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Our findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that macrophage ABCA1 facilitates cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE (60, 72).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	265	Under the experimental conditions used in our efflux studies, we did not observe marked apoE isoform specificity in a pattern that was consistent between astrocyte and microglial cultures.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In astrocyte cultures, apoE2 was a slightly less potent acceptor than apoE3 or apoE4, but this trend was not observed in microglial cultures where no significant differences were observed in efflux among any of the apoE isoforms.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Our findings are in contrast to a previous study suggesting that apoE2 elicits more cholesterol efflux than apoE3 or apoE4 (73).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The reasons why our findings differ from previous work are not clear, but may be due to subtle differences in culture preparation or efflux protocol.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	269	In this study, we show that ABCA1 plays a critical role in the secretion of apoE from both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	270	 These observations confirm and extend a previous study in which ABCA1 was found to facilitate apoE secretion from human monocyte-derived macrophages (61).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	271	 We also demonstrate that ABCA1 is positively correlated with steady-state levels of intracellular apoE as well as with apoE secreted into the medium, both of which are measures of dynamic processes.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Steady-state intracellular apoE levels reflect a balance between apoE synthesis and degradation of both newly synthesized and recycled apoE, whereas secreted apoE levels reflect a balance between apoE released from the cell coupled with reuptake of apoE by apoE receptors that are expressed in both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Although the mechanisms by which ABCA1 affect apoE metabolism in glial cells are not yet understood, it is clear that lack of ABCA1 impairs the proportion of total apoE that is secreted into the medium in both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	274	There are several potential mechanisms by which ABCA1 may affect apoE metabolism, which may or may not be linked functionally to lipid efflux.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	275	 ABCA1 is known to cycle between the plasma membrane and late endosomal compartments (74) and, in addition to the plasma membrane, it has been suggested that ABCA1 may efflux cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes (65).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Moreover, apoA-I has been recently reported to be internalized and resecreted during ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (75).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	277	 An increasing body of evidence indicates that internalized apoE does not undergo complete degradation and that it is resecreted (75-77).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	278	 For example, nascent lipoproteins recovered from livers of apoE-/- mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow, a model in which circulating apoE is derived exclusively from macrophages, showed that up to 60% of internalized apoE may be reutilized under physiological conditions (78).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Recently, HDL3 was shown to stimulate the recycling of internalized apoE and to act as an extracellular acceptor for recycled apoE in hepatoma cells (76).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In this study, apoE recycling was accompanied by cholesterol efflux and involved internalization of HDL3-derived apoA-I and its targeting to endosomes containing cholesterol and apoE (76).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Taken together, these observations suggest the possibility that apoE secretion and recycling may be coupled to cholesterol efflux and that ABCA1 may play a role in this process.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	282	It is also possible to speculate that ABCA1 could influence apoE secretion by affecting trafficking in secretory or recycling pathways.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	283	 In this respect, plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 may have a distinct function compared with intracytoplasmic ABCA1.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	284	 For example, plasma membrane-associated ABCA1 may function to transport cholesterol and phospholipids to various extracellular apolipoprotein acceptors, whereas intracytoplasmic ABCA1 may primarily participate in intracellular lipid trafficking.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Additionally, it is known that apoE requires prenylation in order to be efficiently secreted (79), suggesting the possibility that any impact of ABCA1 on prenylation pathways might also affect apoE secretion.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Although much remains to be learned, our results provide support for a role of ABCA1 in apoE secretion.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	287	 have reported that nascent particles released into conditioned medium from ABCA1-/- astrocytes contain less cholesterol than wild-type particles, suggesting that ABCA1 affects both secretion and lipidation of apoE in the CNS.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	288	In vivo, total apoE levels are reduced by 65% in whole brains of ABCA1-/- compared with wild-type animals, indicating a critical role for ABCA1 in maintaining normal apoE homeostasis in the CNS under physiological conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Loss of ABCA1 affects apoE levels most severely in the hippocampus and striatum, whereas cortex and thalamus are moderately affected by ABCA1 deficiency.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	290	 ApoE levels in the cerebellum are minimally reduced in ABCA1-/- mice compared with wild-type controls.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	291	 We hypothesize that defective secretion of apoE from astrocytes and microglia is a key factor that underlies the reduced apoE levels in vivo.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In the absence of ABCA1, both astrocytes and microglia secrete less apoE, and the intracellular pool of microglial apoE available for secretion is also lower.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Interestingly, elimination of ABCA1 had no effect on apoJ levels, suggesting that ABCA1 selectively regulates apoE metabolism rather than having a general effect on other brain-derived apolipoproteins.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	294	 To our knowledge, whether deficiency of human ABCA1 results in changes in CNS or CSF levels of apoE has not been determined.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	295	The in vivo reduction of brain apoE levels, coupled with the reduced ability of ABCA1-/- glia to maintain normal levels of cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion in vitro, suggests that ABCA1 deficiency may impair normal brain function, particularly in response to injury or disease.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	296	 ApoE expression is known to be induced in glial cells in response to neuronal injury, where it is believed to participate in lipid transport processes involved in repairing neuronal membranes (36, 80).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Because ABCA1 deficiency results in region-specific reductions in apoE levels in brain, it is possible to speculate that ABCA1 may play a role in recovery from a variety of neurological insults by facilitating lipid mobilization via apoE.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	298	Our observation that ABCA1-/- mice have a significant reduction in apoE levels in brain creates a paradox for predictions about the role of ABCA1 in AD.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In this study, we provide the first direct evidence that glial ABCA1 affects apoE metabolism in vivo and in vitro.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Reduced levels of apoE in ABCA1-/- brains may predict a greater susceptibility to neuronal injury due to decreased lipid-mediated repair pathways, yet lower levels of apoE may also delay amyloid deposition.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In addition to glial ABCA1, neuronal ABCA1 may also participate in AD by affecting A generation.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	302	 At present, it is controversial whether ABCA1 increases or decreases A generation, as two in vitro studies reported that increased ABCA1 expression reduced A production (18, 81), whereas a third study reported the opposite finding (19).
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Genetic variations in ABCA1 have been reported to alter the susceptibility to AD (82, 83), although additional studies are necessary to fully validate these results.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Clearly, understanding the contributions of ABCA1 to AD will require in vivo studies in which the contribution of glial and neuronal ABCA1 to the pathogenesis of AD can be evaluated in an appropriate physiological context.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	305	In summary, we demonstrate that glial ABCA1 is a key participant in apoE metabolism.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	306	 We show that selective disruption of ABCA1 reduces cholesterol efflux to exogenous apoE and impairs apoE secretion from both astrocytes and microglia.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	307	 As a result, ABCA1-/- glia accumulate lipids under normal culture conditions.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In vivo, ABCA1 is required to maintain normal levels of apoE in brain.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Further, the effect of ABCA1 is specific to apoE and is independent of HDL and apoA-I levels.
0.29108343.15269218.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Taken together, our observations provide a clear and direct link between ABCA1 and apoE metabolism in brain.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	6	Apolipoprotein (apo) E mediates lipoprotein remnant clearance via interaction with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Both the 22-kDa N-terminal domain and 10-kDa C-terminal domain of apoE contain a heparin binding site; the N-terminal site overlaps with the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region and the C-terminal site is undefined.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To understand the molecular details of the apoE-heparin interaction, we defined the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues in intact apoE3 and examined their relative contributions to heparin binding.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed that, in apoE3-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine discs, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicating high positive electrostatic potential around these residues.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Binding experiments using heparin-Sepharose gel demonstrated that the lipid-free 10-kDa fragment interacted strongly with heparin and a point mutation K233Q largely abolished the binding, indicating that Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding and that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment is critical for the interaction with heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	11	 With lipidated apoE3, it is confirmed that the Lys-233 site is completely masked and the N-terminal site mediates heparin binding.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, mutations of the two heparin binding sites in intact apoE3 demonstrated the dominant role of the N-terminal site in the heparin binding of apoE even in the lipid-free state.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results suggest that apoE interacts predominately with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans through the N-terminal binding site.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, Lys-233 may be involved in the binding of apoE to certain cell-surface sites, such as the protein core of biglycan.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	15	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	16	Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1 is a critical ligand for several hepatic lipoprotein receptors, including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (1-3).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Through its interaction with these receptors and with the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE mediates the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins (4, 5).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then to transfer to the LRP for internalization (6, 7).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Therefore, the interaction of apoE with HSPG is an initial step in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins from the plasma.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The apoE-HSPG interaction is also involved in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (8, 9), the existence of a pool of newly secreted apoE on the cell surface (10-12), and the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation (13).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition, several studies suggest that binding of apoE to HSPG may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (5, 14, 15).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	22	ApoE, a 299-amino acid, single chain protein, contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1-191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222-299) (2, 16).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic -helices and contains the LDL receptor binding region (residues 136-150 in helix 4) (17).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The amphipathic nature of the -helix containing residues 136-150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Our recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that Lys-143 and Lys-146 have unusually low pKa values because of local increases in positive electrostatic potential associated with the region surrounding residues 136-150 (19, 20).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The C-terminal domain is also predicted to be a highly -helical structure and contains the major lipid binding region (21, 22).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The detailed molecular features of the -helices in the C-terminal domain are poorly understood.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	28	The N- and C-terminal domains each contain a heparin binding site (23, 24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 142-147 and overlaps with the receptor binding region (24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In fact, the HSPG binding activity of apoE variants is significantly decreased by mutations of Arg-142, Arg-145, and Lys-146, indicating that these basic amino acid residues contribute to heparin binding (25).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	31	 A recent study on the interaction between a heparin-derived oligosaccharide and the N-terminal domain of apoE4 found that Arg-142 and -145 form salt bridges with sulfate groups from the octasaccharide fragment (26), consistent with a dramatically reduced binding affinity of apoE4(R142C) and apoE4(R145C) mutants for HSPG (25).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This study also predicted additional interactions between the heparin fragment and Lys-143, Lys-146, and Arg-147.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Most recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study showed that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 are required for high-affinity binding to heparin, with Lys-146 participating in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment and Lys-143 participating in a hydrogen bond (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	34	The goal of the current study was to identify the heparin binding site in the C-terminal domain of apoE and to characterize its contribution to the apoE-heparin interaction in both lipid-free and lipidated states.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We demonstrated that the isolated C-terminal domain binds to heparin with higher affinity than the N-terminal domain in the lipid-free state and that an unusual basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Surprisingly, this C-terminal site is unavailable for heparin binding in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule, suggesting that only the N-terminal site contributes to the interaction of apoE with HSPG in vivo.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In this study, application of a higher field (600 MHz) NMR spectrometer enabled us to evaluate the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues of full-length apoE3 because of the enhanced resolution of the resonances in the NMR spectrum.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	108	 These results indicate that the interaction between the 10-kDa fragment and heparin is electrostatic (36, 37) and the amphipathic characteristics common in helical apolipoproteins (38) are not responsible for heparin binding.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	119	 3, a large decrease in heparin binding was observed only for the 10-kDa (K233Q) variant (maximal binding capacity was 31% of the wild-type 10-kDa fragment) without a change in binding affinity (Kd values for both were 76  microg/ml).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Of the four lysines in the C-terminal domain, only Lys-233 showed a relatively low pKa value (Table I), suggesting that an unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is critical for the interaction between the C-terminal domain and heparin.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In the lipid-free form, full-length apoE and the 10-kDa fragment bound to heparin with similar affinities, whereas the 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with much lower affinity (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	126	 When complexed with DMPC, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished, indicating that the C-terminal binding site is masked by lipids (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Instead, the lipidated 22-kDa fragment bound to heparin with high affinity and rather better than full-length apoE.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Although the binding capacity of lipidated full-length apoE3 was much lower than that of the lipid-free form, the binding affinity of full-length apoE3 in both states was similar (Kd for the lipid-free and lipidated forms were 157 and 210  microg/ml, respectively), consistent with the previous observation using surface plasmon resonance analysis (37).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	133	Heparin Binding of ApoE Mutants-- The above observations suggest that the two apoE domains contribute differently to heparin binding, with the C-terminal domain playing a dominant role in the lipid-free state and the N-terminal domain in the lipidated state.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	134	 To examine this hypothesis, we introduced mutations into two lysines of full-length apoE and compared the heparin binding activities of these variants.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The mutated proteins were apoE(K146Q) and apoE(K146E), which have N-terminal domains that bind defectively to heparin (27), and apoE3(K233Q) and apoE3(K233E), which are thought to have low heparin binding capacity through the C-terminal site.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Large decreases in heparin binding were observed with apoE(K146E) in both the lipid-free (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	137	 5A) and the DMPC-complexed forms (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	138	 5B), indicating that Lys-146 contributes greatly to the heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	139	 5, A and B, the lipid-free apoE(K146Q) exhibited a much smaller decrease in heparin binding than wild-type apoE3, and apoE(K146Q)-DMPC complexes bound to heparin in a similar manner to the lipid-free form.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This disparity between apoE(K146E) and apoE(K146Q) variants is probably because of the ionization state of the glutamate residue at pH 7.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In the case of the apoE3(K233E) variant, a small decrease in heparin binding was observed in the lipid-free form; complexing with DMPC had virtually no effect on the heparin binding ability of this variant (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	148	 5, C and D), suggesting that the Lys-233 site is unavailable for heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	149	 For wild-type apoE and the apoE(K146E) and apoE(K233Q) variants, the heparin binding of free protein differs from that of the protein-DMPC complexes.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Binding to DMPC results in the opening of the four-helix bundle in the N-terminal domain of apoE (40-42).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Therefore, it is likely that these apoE variants have subtle differences in their final conformations on the DMPC disc that may modulate their heparin binding properties (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This may be the reason why the lipidated K146Q and K223E variants bind somewhat more to heparin than wild-type apoE3.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	153	To further explore the role of the C-terminal domain in the heparin binding of apoE, we used apoE (1-260), a C-terminal truncated variant that is monomeric rather than tetrameric in aqueous solution (21).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Although the C-terminal heparin binding site is conserved in this variant, the heparin binding of apoE (1-260) was significantly lower than wild-type apoE3 and close to that of the apoE3 22-kDa fragment (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This indicates that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain has a major influence on the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	156	 We also measured the binding of the 12-kDa apoE fragment (2) to heparin to investigate whether the hinge region plays a role in the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Surprisingly, the heparin binding ability almost disappeared for the lipid-free 12-kDa fragment (Fig.

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	164	The interaction between apoE and HSPG is important in several processes, such as lipoprotein remnant clearance (5, 43) and neurite outgrowth (3, 14).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	165	 ApoE has at least two heparin binding sites located between residues 142 and 147 in the N-terminal receptor binding region (24) and less well defined sites in the C-terminal lipid binding region (23, 24).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211-218 (23) and 243-272 (24) contain heparin binding sites.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	170	 It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211-218 (23) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243-272 (24); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	173	Our NMR results imply that among all 12 lysines of full-length apoE3, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicative of high positive electrostatic potential around these residues.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	176	 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In an amphipathic -helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	178	 It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic -helix.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	180	Comparison of the heparin binding abilities of full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments yields interesting insights.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	183	 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24, 44).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	186	 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1-260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46, 47).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	190	 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	191	Despite the strong heparin binding ability of the 10-kDa fragment, the C-terminal site of full-length apoE3 does not appear to be involved in the heparin binding of lipid-free apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	192	 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	194	 One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192-215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, interaction between the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region might mask the C-terminal heparin binding site (the basic residues around Lys-233), preventing interaction with heparin.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	197	 A recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of apoE3 indicates spatial proximity between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the lipid-free state, with the hinge region tethering the N-terminal domain close to the C-terminal domain (48).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	198	ApoE-containing high density lipoproteins bind to the proteoglycan, biglycan, in arterial walls, and apoE is thought to act as a bridging molecule that traps these particles in atherosclerotic intima (49).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This binding interaction between apoE and biglycan was shown recently to occur via the C-terminal domain in which the charged residues, especially lysine and arginine between residues 223 and 230, are involved in the binding (50, 51).
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The results of the present study suggest that the unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 contributes to the apoE-biglycan interaction.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Recent studies demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of apoE are complexed with amyloid in the brain (52, 53) and that C-terminal-truncated forms of apoE occur in Alzheimer's disease (54).

0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	203	In conclusion, we have identified the heparin binding site of the C-terminal domain of apoE.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Our data show that the basic residues around lysine 233 are critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain but are unavailable for heparin binding in full-length apoE even in the lipid-free state.
0.3125666.12588864.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thus, it seems that lipid-poor apoE associates with cell surface HSPG only through the N-terminal domain, leaving the C-terminal domain available for binding to lipoprotein particles.

0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	4	This study showed that synthetic peptides containing either a single copy or tandem repeat of the receptor binding domain sequence of apolipoprotein (apo) E, or a peptide containing its C-terminal heparin binding domain, apoE-(211-243), were all effective inhibitors of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In contrast, only the peptide containing a tandem repeating unit of the receptor binding domain sequence of apoE, apoE-(141-155)2, was capable of inhibiting PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Peptide containing only a single unit of this sequence, apoE-(141-155), or the apoE-(211-243) peptide were ineffective in inhibiting PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Additional experiments showed that reductively methylated apoE, which is incapable of receptor binding yet retains its heparin binding capability, was equally effective as apoE in inhibiting PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, reductively methylated apoE was unable to inhibit smooth muscle cell migration toward PDGF.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Additionally, the receptor binding domain-specific apoE antibody 1D7 also mitigated the anti-migratory properties of apoE on smooth muscle cells.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Finally, pretreatment of cells with heparinase failed to abolish apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Taken together, these data documented that apoE inhibition of PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation is mediated by its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, while its inhibition of cell migration is mediated through apoE binding to cell surface receptors.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	12	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	13	Research in the past two decades has clearly demonstrated that apolipoprotein (apo)1 E protects against vascular disease (1).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Mice deficient in apoE emphasize the importance of apoE in protection against atherosclerosis.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The apoE-deficient mice generated by gene targeting approach have plasma cholesterol levels of 400-500 mg/dl and develop severe atherosclerosis when fed a chow diet (2-5).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In contrast, wild type mice have plasma cholesterol levels of 60-85 mg/dl and do not develop atherosclerosis under normal conditions.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Atherosclerotic lesions in mice with only one copy of the apoE gene (apoE+/) were 10 times more severe than lesions in wild type mice that were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet, despite relative similar cholesterol levels between the two groups of animals (326 versus 238 mg/dl).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In these studies, a direct correlation between serum cholesterol levels and atherosclerotic lesion size was not observed.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Additionally, transgenic expression of apoE in the arterial wall inhibited atheroma formation and severity without affecting plasma cholesterol level and lipoprotein profile in cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mice (6).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Taken together, the data showing an inverse relationship between apoE level and atherosclerotic lesion size, but a lack of correlation between total cholesterol and atherosclerosis lesion size, have led to the hypothesis that apoE may have direct impact on vascular occlusive diseases in a manner in addition to, and independent of, its property as a cholesterol-transporting apolipoprotein (7).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recent data from our laboratory have indicated that apoE protection against vascular occlusive disease may be directly related to its modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell response to stimulation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We have shown that apoE inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- or oxidized LDL-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (8).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	23	 ApoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation was shown to be due to cell cycle arrest resulting from the inhibition of growth factor-induced cyclin D1 activation (8).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The mechanism of this inhibition appeared to be mediated through inducible nitric-oxide synthase signaling pathways (9).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In contrast, apoE inhibition of growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration was independent of inducible nitric-oxide synthase activation (9).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Thus, it is likely that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration is mediated through mechanism(s) distinct from the pathways involved with its anti-proliferative effects.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The hypothesis that apoE inhibits growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation via distinct mechanisms was further supported by data showing that low doses (0.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	28	1-5  microg/ml) of apoE were capable of inhibiting smooth muscle cell migration, while higher doses (25 and 50  microg/ml) were necessary for apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation (9).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	29	Apolipoprotein E binds to all members of the LDL receptor gene family as well as to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the surface of mammalian cells (10-12).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recent studies from several laboratories showed that ligand binding to LDL receptor gene family members can mediate signal transduction events (13-19).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Likewise, ligand binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans may also induce signal transduction events (20-22).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Smooth muscle cells are known to express HSPG as well as many receptors of the LDL receptor gene family, including the LDL receptor, LRP, the VLDL receptor, and the apoE receptor-2 LR8 (10, 11, 23).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The goal of the current study is to determine whether apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation is mediated through its interaction with cell surface receptors or with HSPG.

0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Moreover, the receptor binding properties of apoE require multiple copies of the receptor binding domain (30, 31).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Thus, the differential effects of the apoE peptides on PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration suggest that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration may be mediated by its interaction with cell surface receptors, while its inhibition of cell proliferation requires its interaction with HSPG.

0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	176	Previous studies have documented that residues 141-155 encompass the receptor binding domain of apoE (34).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This domain and the one encompassing residues 211-243 have also been identified as heparin interaction sites on apoE (28, 29).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The difference between receptor and heparin binding properties of apoE is that multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for receptor interaction (30, 31, 36), while a single copy of either domain is sufficient to confer heparin interaction (28, 29).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Results of the current study showed that peptides containing at least one copy of either the receptor binding domain or the distal heparin binding site of apoE were capable of inhibiting PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	180	 These results indicated that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation is mediated via its interaction with HSPG on the cell surface.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Interestingly, none of these peptides were as effective as native apoE in inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This observation suggested that optimal inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation may involve multiple domain interactions between apoE and HSPG.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	183	The interactive role of apoE and HSPG in the modulation of cell functions has been proposed previously.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (37) showed that endogenously expressed apoE enhances cellular proteoglycan synthesis.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Exogenously added apoE also yielded a 2-fold induction of proteoglycan synthesis and secretion by smooth muscle cells (38, 39).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The latter study further demonstrated a correlation between apoE inhibition of cell proliferation and its induction of HSPG synthesis.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Anti-perlecan antibody was also shown to completely abrogate the anti-proliferative effect of apoE (38).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Based on these observations, these investigators proposed that apoE, like other anti-proliferative agents such as transforming growth factor- (40) and heparin (41), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation by promoting the synthesis and secretion of perlecan (38).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, the mechanism by which apoE stimulates perlecan synthesis and the cell surface molecules responsible for these apoE effects have not been determined.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The current study showed that apoE inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation via binding to cell surface HSPG.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Thus, it is likely that apoE-HSPG interaction induces intracellular signals required for activation of perlecan synthesis and its subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The observation that reductively methylated apoE, which does not bind to receptors but remains active in HSPG binding, was capable of inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation is supportive of this conclusion.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	193	In contrast to their effects on cell proliferation, peptides containing either a single copy of the receptor binding domain or the distal heparin binding domain of apoE did not inhibit PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Only the peptide containing a tandem repeating sequence of the receptor binding domain of apoE displayed anti-migratory effects.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In fact, the apoE-(141-155)2 peptide was equally as active as native apoE in inhibiting PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Moreover, our results also showed that reductive methylation of apoE, which abolished its receptor, but not its heparin, binding activities (25, 33), also abolished the anti-migratory, but not the anti-proliferative, effects of apoE.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These results, taken together with observations showing the receptor domain-specific apoE antibody abolished the anti-migratory properties of apoE, indicated that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle migration is mediated via its binding to cell surface receptors and is independent of HSPG interaction.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	198	The mechanism by which apoE interaction with receptors results in inhibition of cell migration remains unknown at this time.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that apoE interaction with LDL receptor gene family member proteins may lead to signal transduction events that can modulate cell functions.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	200	 For example, apoE binding to apoE receptor-2 (LR8) on platelets has been shown to induce nitric oxide synthesis and inhibit agonist-induced platelet aggregation (42, 43).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Interestingly, LR8 contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) consensus sequence, as well as domains that can serve as targets for cGMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinases.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, it is possible that apoE inhibits platelet aggregation and induction of nitric oxide synthesis through LR8-mediated signal transduction events.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This receptor is also present in the brain and has been shown to be important for reelin signaling and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-signaling pathway (14, 15, 44).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Likewise, both the VLDL receptor and LRP have been shown to interact with cytosolic adaptor and scaffold proteins and modulate the transmission of extracellular signals to activate intracellular tyrosine kinases (16).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Since LRP, VLDL receptor, and LR8 are all present on the surface of smooth muscle cells, it is possible that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration is mediated through signaling events subsequent to apoE binding to one or more of these receptors.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The identification of the receptor responsible for mediating apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration will contribute to our understanding in this regard.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	207	Regardless of the exact mechanisms involved, our data documented that the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of apoE are distinct, requiring different concentrations of apoE (9), and are mediated through its interaction with HSPG and cell surface receptors, respectively.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	208	 A concentration-dependent effect of apoE on cell functions has been reported previously in studies examining its role on regulation of androgen synthesis by the ovary.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Dyer and Curtiss (45) showed that low concentrations of apoE promoted androgen synthesis, while high concentrations of apoE were inhibitory.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Subsequent studies revealed that the tandem repeat peptide apoE-(141-155)2 mimicked the effect of intact apoE, but the single-copy peptide encompassing apoE residues 129-162 did not stimulate androgen production but rather inhibited androgen synthesis at high concentrations (46).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These authors suggested that apoE stimulation of androgen production may be mediated through apoE binding to members of the LDL receptor gene family (46) and that inhibition of androgen synthesis at high apoE concentrations is mediated by a mechanism independent of any LDL receptor-related proteins.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Although the exact mechanism by which apoE modulates androgen production in ovaries has not been identified, it is possible that this cell regulatory function of apoE is similar to that observed here, i.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	213	 through processes mediated by distinct cell signaling mechanisms as a consequence of apoE interaction with receptors and HSPG (8, 9).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	214	In summary, this study adds to the expanding literature documenting a direct role of apoE interaction with receptors and HSPG in signal transduction and modulation of cell functions.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The current study also documented that apoE interaction with receptors and HSPG modulates distinct cell functions, i.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	216	 inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, possibly through triggering of different signal transduction pathways.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus, apoE may protect against vascular occlusive diseases by multiple mechanisms, including reverse cholesterol transport and inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We have previously shown that the apoE level in circulation can directly influence neointimal hyperplasia in response to vascular injury, a process that is independent of lipid transport (47).
0.3230321.11350966.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Accordingly, designing therapeutic agents that can increase the apoE level in circulation may be beneficial in combating vascular disease via multiple mechanisms.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	7	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-mediated cholesterol efflux involves the binding of apoA-I to the plasma membrane via its C terminus and requires cellular ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) activity.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	8	 ApoA-I also stimulates secretion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) from macrophage foam cells, although the mechanism of this process is not understood.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this study, we demonstrate that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of both ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and of lipid binding by its C terminus.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Pulse-chase experiments using 35S-labeled cellular apoE demonstrate that macrophage apoE exists in both relatively mobile (Em) and stable (Es) pools, that apoA-I diverts apoE from degradation to secretion, and that only a small proportion of apoA-I-mobilized apoE is derived from the cell surface.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The structural requirements for induction of apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux are clearly dissociated, as C-terminal deletions in recombinant apoA-I reduce cholesterol efflux but increase apoE secretion, and deletion of central helices 5 and 6 decreases apoE secretion without perturbing cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, a range of 11- and 22-mer -helical peptides representing amphipathic -helical segments of apoA-I stimulate apoE secretion whereas only the C-terminal -helix (domains 220 to 241) stimulates cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Other -helix-containing apolipoproteins (apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoE2, apoE3, apoE4) also stimulate apoE secretion, implying a positive feedback autocrine loop for apoE secretion, although apoE4 is less effective.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Finally, apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion normally from macrophages of two unrelated subjects with genetically confirmed Tangier Disease (mutations C733R and c.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	16	4629 to 4630insA), despite severely inhibited cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We conclude that apoA-I stimulates secretion of apoE independently of cholesterol efflux, and that this represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback pathway for stimulation of potentially anti-atherogenic apoE secretion by -helix-containing molecules including apoA-I and apoE.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	18	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The anti-atherogenic effects of high density lipoprotein (HDL)1 (1) are at least in part attributed to the ability of HDL to stimulate cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from lipid-loaded macrophages, providing the initial step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of HDL, is understood to play an important role in this process (1).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	20	Lipid removal by apoA-I involves a cAMP-inducible active transport pathway (2) and is known to be mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA1/ABC-1) (3).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These transporters are membrane proteins that utilize ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across membranes (4).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Mutations in ABCA1/ABC-1 cause Tangier disease (TD), a severe HDL deficiency syndrome characterized by very low plasma levels of HDL and apoA-I, accumulation of cholesterol in tissue macrophages, and a predisposition to atherosclerosis (5 to 7).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Fibroblasts from subjects with Tangier disease show impaired cholesterol and phospholipid release to lipid-free apolipoproteins (8).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, inhibition of ABCA1 expression or activity inhibits lipid efflux to apoA-I in normal fibroblasts (3, 6).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	25	Properties additional to induction of cholesterol efflux may contribute to the anti-atherogenic effect of apoA-1.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Human atherosclerotic lesions contain apoE protein and mRNA, especially in association with macrophage foam cells (9).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Secretion of apoE by macrophages may protect against atherosclerosis, as indicated by the effects of transplantation of apoE-expressing bone marrow into apoE-null mice (10, 11).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This may depend upon enhanced local clearance of cellular lipids and/or inhibition of local inflammatory responses, in addition to lowering plasma concentrations of atherogenic plasma lipoproteins.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recent studies demonstrated that apoA-I stimulates both apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux from human and mouse foam cell macrophages (12, 13).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Stimulation of apoE secretion by apoA-I and by HDL is most likely post-transcriptionally regulated and is observed for both endogenous apoE (macrophages) and recycled apoE (hepatocytes) (12 to 15).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Recent studies indicate that ABCA1 may be involved in basal apoE secretion (16).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, the requirement for ABCA1 activity in apoA-I-induced apoE secretion has never been reported.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	33	In this study we provide evidence that apoA-I-stimulated apoE secretion is mechanistically distinct from its stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We demonstrate that apoA-I promotes secretion of a mobile pool of apoE, which is otherwise destined for intracellular degradation, that this process does not require interactions between the C terminus of apoA-I and the plasma membrane and occurs normally in macrophages of patients with Tangier disease, implying independence from ABCA1 activity.

0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	406	 A similar dissociation was earlier reported for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion (61).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	407	 We have investigated in detail the structural and functional requirements for apoA-I-induced apoE secretion and identify these as being quite distinct from those required for apoA-I-induced cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	408	ApoA-I does not increase macrophage apoE mRNA levels, and pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that apoA-I stimulates secretion of newly synthesized apoE, confirming that apoA-I-stimulates apoE secretion post-transcriptionally.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Modeling of pulse-chase data indicated that human macrophages contain a larger mobile pool of apoE (Em), and a lesser, more stable pool of apoE (Es).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Previous studies indicate that such heterogeneous pools of apoE may include apoE on the cell surface (47).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Pronase treatment of human macrophages under our experimental conditions indicates that only a small proportion of Es is on the cell surface.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	412	2 Em is, on the basis of our biotin-labeling and 4  degrees C displacement studies, in part derived from the cell surface pool of apoE, and apoA-I increases secretion and concurrently diminishes degradation of apoE from this pool.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	413	 However, as the biotin-labeled pool represents only a minor proportion of total apoE secreted ( < 2%), its quantitative significance is unclear.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	414	 These data are consistent with either continual displacement of apoE from the cell surface with its recycling and ongoing replenishment from intracellular pools (41), or is consistent with two sources of secreted apoE, a smaller cell surface pool and a larger intracellular pool, both of which are mobilized by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	415	It is clear that the structural requirements for apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion are distinct from those required for cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Our studies of recombinant (pro-)apoA-I molecules demonstrate that deletion of the C terminus of apoA-I enhances apoE secretion whereas it impairs cholesterol efflux and phospholipid efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	417	 This is remarkable as all previous studies of apoA-I function have emphasized the importance of its lipid binding C-terminal domain for functional integrity and for binding to the extracellular matrix of the cell surface (62).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	418	 That C-terminal deletion enhances apoE secretion suggests that apoA-I does not bind to extracellular matrix to achieve this (62).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	419	 This is consistent with our previous studies indicating that heparinase pretreatment does not inhibit apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion from primary macrophages (13).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	420	The central domain of apoA-I regulates LCAT activity (63) and HDL-mediated inhibition of macrophage homing to atherosclerotic plaque (64).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Deletion of this central region of apoA-I (d123 to 166) was the only modification that decreased the stimulation of apoE secretion by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	422	 As this domain affects apoA-I flexibility (29), it suggests that for whole apoA-I, flexibility is more important than lipid affinity in inducing apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	423	 It is unlikely to contain an epitope specific for apoA-I-induced apoE secretion given that -helical peptides away from this domain, and other apolipoproteins, also induced apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Whether apolipoprotein flexibility is also important for other apolipoproteins, e.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	425	 apoA-II, apoA-IV, and apoEs, is unknown.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	426	Systematic comparison of individual -helical peptides of apoA-I identified that only the C-terminal -helical peptide was capable of independently inducing cholesterol efflux from primary human macrophages, consistent with earlier studies (50).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	427	 In contrast, all -helical peptides stimulated apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	428	 As cholesterol efflux to peptides is related to their lipid affinity (50), this property does not appear to determine induction of apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Stimulation of apoE secretion appears to be a general structural property of -helical proteins and peptides, which, in the case of whole apoA-I, can be enhanced by overall protein flexibility and inhibited by lipid binding to the plasma membrane.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	430	One of our most striking observations was the enhanced secretion of apoE to apoA-I-POPC discs relative to apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	431	 This was not observed with apoA-II, which stimulated apoE secretion to the same extent in free or lipid-bound state.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	432	 The difference in response to lipidation of apoA-I and apoA-II is interesting given that cholesterol efflux to both apolipoproteins increased with lipidation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Apolipoprotein-mediated apoE secretion may allow subsequent binding of secreted apoE to exogenous phospholipids, and this could explain some apparent synergy between apoA-I and POPC.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	434	 However, association of apoE with apoA-I- or apoA-II-POPC discs would be expected to require displacement of apoA-I or apoA-II and/or to increase the apparent size of POPC-containing particles, neither of which were found on non-denaturing gel electrophoresis.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	435	 The absence of synergy between apoA-II and POPC therefore suggests conformational changes unique to apoA-I occur during its lipidation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	436	 We suggest that apoA-I exposes more polar, non-lipid bound residues as a POPC disc than does apoA-II, and that this enhances interaction with exposed residues of apoE on the cell surface, or with undefined plasma membrane sites critical for stimulating vesicular trafficking of apoE to the cell surface.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	437	ApoA-I, A-II, A-IV, E3, and apolipoprotein-phospholipid discs all stimulated apoE secretion efficiently, indicating stimulation of apoE secretion is of broad relevance in vivo.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	438	 The ability of apoE to stimulate apoE secretion is highly significant, as local (autocrine) secretion of apoE in the artery wall could mediate further apoE secretion from neighboring cells, independently of the requirement for plasma-derived HDL species.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	439	 ApoE4 increases the risk of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease relative to apoE3 (65).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Reduced local stimulation of apoE secretion by apoE4 in the artery or in the CNS might contribute to disease states associated with the apoE4 phenotype.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	441	 ApoE4 differs from apoE3 in a single amino acid substitution, arginine instead of cysteine in position 112.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	442	 This confers a more positive apoE charge, and causes conformational change to the N-terminal helix of apoE4, as a salt bridge forms between Arg112 and Glu109, and this alters the conformation of Arg61, which interacts with Glu255 (55).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	443	 E4 also differs from E3 and E2 in lacking the potential for disulfide formation and self-association.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	444	 In a previous study, Smith et al.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	445	 (2) identified that the binding of E2, E3, and E4 to RAW macrophages, and the cholesterol efflux induced by these isoforms, were the same.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	446	 Our studies confirmed similar efflux to the various apoE isoforms, supporting that differences in inducible apoE secretion cannot be explained by altered efflux, or binding.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	447	 A recent study indicates that apoE4 has a higher lipid affinity than other apoE isoforms (56), and in this respect, these data support our observations that C-terminal deletions of apoA-I, which diminish its lipid affinity enhance its ability to induce apoE secretion.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	448	That apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and apoE secretion are independently regulated was directly confirmed by apoA-I-stimulated apoE secretion in two unrelated subjects with clinical, molecular, and cellular phenotype of Tangier disease.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	449	 Despite impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and severely reduced basal apoE secretion, apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	450	 Recent studies have shown that apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 is linked to accelerated secretory vesicular transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and this is absent in Tangier disease fibroblasts (66).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	451	 As apoA-I stimulated apoE secretion normally from Tangier disease macrophages, we conclude that apoA-I must stimulate a distinct pathway of apoE secretion unrelated to its interactions with ABCA1 or its stimulation of cholesterol efflux.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	452	 As apoE secretion induced by apoA-I is severalfold greater than basal apoE secretion, ABCA1-independent secretion is likely to be quantitatively more important than that related to ABCA1 activity.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	453	 To our knowledge these findings represent the first reported non-ABCA1-mediated cellular process mediated by apoA-I.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	454	It is unlikely that apoA-I stimulates apoE secretion by directly inhibiting lysosomal or proteasomal degradation of apoE.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	455	 ApoE is degraded in the lysosomal and proteasomal compartments (67) (68), and, although direct inhibition of lysosomal and cysteine proteases does inhibit apoE degradation, this does not increase apoE secretion (58).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	456	 The possibility that apoA-I exchanges with cellular apoE such that apoA-I is degraded in place of apoE also seems unlikely, as the mass of apoA-I degraded corresponds to  < 30% of the mass of apoE secreted from human macrophages during time course experiments.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	457	3 It is more likely that apoA-I promotes apoE secretion by inhibiting its trafficking to degradatory compartments such as the lysosome and proteasome, or by stimulating vesicular traffic to the plasma membrane analogous to effects described in fibroblasts (66).
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	458	 Although HDL stimulates a range of protein kinase C-dependent and -independent signaling pathways, these are not necessarily activated by apoA-I (69), and the mechanisms by which apoA-I regulates vesicle traffic in general, and protein secretion in particular, require further investigation.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	459	We conclude that apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion has structural requirements distinct from those regulating the stimulation of cholesterol efflux, facilitated by the central hinge region of apoA-I but inhibited by its C-terminal domain, and is independent of macrophage ABCA1 activity.
0.33803913.15066991.html.plaintext.txt	460	 This represents a novel, ABCA-1-independent, positive feedback process for secretion of anti-atherogenic, cholesterol-efflux-inducing apoE by -helix-containing molecules.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	6	The importance of hepatocyte-derived apolipoprotein (apo) E in the clearance of remnant lipoproteins in the liver is controversial.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To address this controversy, we compared remnant clearance in two mouse models in which apoE is primarily derived either from hepatocytes or from an extrahepatic source.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Hypomorphic apoE mice universally express reduced levels of apoE in all tissues, with the liver remaining the primary source of apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This mouse model of hepatocyte-derived apoE was compared with Apoe/ mice transplanted with mouse bone marrow as a model of primarily non-hepatocyte-derived apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections revealed that only the hepatocyte-derived apoE model had detectable levels of apoE on hepatic sinusoidal surfaces.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model with plasma apoE levels similar to those in the hepatocyte-derived model had 2-fold more total plasma cholesterol, 4-fold more total plasma triglycerides, and 8-fold higher levels of apoB48, similar to Apoe/ mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Both the hepatocyte-derived and the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models had delayed clearance of an infused bolus of 125I-labeled remnants compared with wild-type mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, after 3 h, plasma remnants reached wild-type levels only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, which had accumulated 70  plus or minus  5% of wild-type levels of remnants in the liver while the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had accumulated only 38  plus or minus  4%.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results demonstrate the existence of a role for both hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This role likely represents the enrichment of remnants sequestered on hepatocyte, with hepatocyte-derived apoE, facilitating their receptor-mediated internalization.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	16	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	17	Plasma remnant lipoproteins are the metabolic end products of intestine-derived chylomicrons and hepatocyte-derived very low density lipoprotein (1-3).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Apolipoprotein (apo)1 E mediates the uptake of remnants in the liver by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR), the LDLR-related protein (LRP), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (4-7).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Inefficient clearance leads to the accumulation of remnants in plasma and contributes to premature atherosclerosis (8, 9).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	20	The liver is the major source of plasma apoE; extrahepatic tissues, primarily macrophages, contribute up to 10% of plasma levels (10).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Hepatocyte-derived apoE has been proposed to promote remnant clearance and uptake through a two-step process referred to as secretion-capture (3, 11, 12).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In the first step, a portion of newly secreted apoE interacts with HSPG and remains bound to hepatocyte cell surfaces; the remainder is released into the space of Disse, where it serves to enrich lipoproteins (11-13).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The presence of apoE on hepatocytes is thought to promote the trapping, or sequestration, of remnants (6, 11).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In support of this mechanism, distinct dynamic pools of apoE on hepatocyte cell surfaces have recently been reported in vitro (14).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In the second step, sequestered remnants are further enriched with hepatocyte-derived apoE and are internalized into hepatocytes through processes mediated by receptors, including the LDLR and the LRP (7, 15-19), or through interactions with HSPG alone (11, 20, 21).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	26	 When apoE/HSPG interactions are disrupted in vivo by intravenous heparinase infusion, remnant clearance is severely inhibited, supporting the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (22, 23).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	27	The importance of hepatically synthesized and localized apoE, and thus the secretion-capture role of apoE, has recently been questioned (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, evidence from mouse models expressing apoE exclusively from extrahepatic sources suggests that hepatic apoE expression is not absolutely required for remnant clearance or for normal plasma cholesterol levels (25-27).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Finally, it is not clear whether hepatic apoE expression is required for remnant clearance in mice lacking the LDLR (24, 28, 29).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	30	We previously reported (30) the generation of hypomorphic apoE (hypoE) mice that express reduced levels of Arg-61 apoE, which is similar to human apoE4 in that it displays apoE4 domain interaction.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The reduction in apoE levels is caused by a neomycin (neo) cassette flanked by loxP sites in Apoe intron 3.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, the expression pattern of the hypomorphic allele remains normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excision of the neo cassette by Cre-mediated gene repair restores normal expression of the allele in all tissues (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Despite having only 2-5% of wild-type plasma apoE levels, hypoE mice display a nearly normal lipoprotein profile.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, in Apoe/ mice with similar plasma apoE levels after transplantation with varying amounts of wild-type bone marrow, remnants accumulate (32).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It was not until plasma apoE levels exceeded 10% of wild-type levels that remnant levels approached normal.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The more efficient remnant clearance in hypoE mice suggests the importance of hepatocyte-derived apoE and the secretion-capture role of apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	38	This study was designed to address the controversy concerning the importance of both hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance in in vivo models.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To this end, remnant clearance was assessed in hypoE mice (a model of hepatocyte-derived apoE) and in Apoe/ mice expressing similar levels of Arg-61 apoE after bone marrow transplantation (a model of non-hepatocyte-derived apoE).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Our results demonstrate that remnant clearance is more efficient in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model and provide in vivo evidence for the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Briefly, a neo cassette flanked by loxP sites was inserted into Apoe intron 3 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to help follow the replacement of the human equivalent of Thr-61 by an arginine, aimed at creating a model of apoE4 (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The presence of the neo cassette in Apoe intron 3 results in reduced apoE mRNA levels in all tissues and organs (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The apoE mRNA levels in the liver, brain, and spleen in targeted mice are ~5% of those in wild-type mice, resulting in plasma apoE levels equal to 0.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	91	Detection of ApoE on Hepatocyte Cell Surfaces in the Liver-- The impact of the tissue source of apoE on remnant clearance was assessed by studying two mouse models expressing low levels of plasma apoE derived primarily from liver hepatocytes or primarily from a peripheral source.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We first examined liver-associated apoE in both mouse models.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	95	 However, unlike Apoe/ mice, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model had some apoE-immunoreactive cells in liver sections, which likely represent macrophage-derived Kupfer cells expressing apoE or cells that have taken up apoE from the circulation.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	144	 These results demonstrate that apoE synthesized by liver hepatocytes favors an overall greater capacity for liver-mediated remnant uptake than apoE synthesized by extrahepatic tissue.

0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	147	This study presents in vivo evidence that demonstrates that the site of apoE synthesis significantly influences remnant clearance and, consequently, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Hepatically derived and localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model was found to be more effective than macrophage-derived apoE in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model in promoting the plasma clearance and liver uptake of apoB48-containing remnants.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Moreover, the low levels of hepatically derived and localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model influenced the late but not the initial part of remnant clearance.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	150	Because the hepatocyte-derived apoE model expresses Arg-61 apoE, the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model was generated by using Cre-deleted Arg-61 bone marrow to allow for a direct comparison with the hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In these mice, Cre-mediated excision of the neo cassette in Apoe intron 3 results in normal apoE expression levels in all tissues, including macrophages (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The normal lipid and lipoprotein levels in Cre-deleted Arg-61 mice suggest that Arg-61 apoE and wild-type apoE are equally effective in remnant clearance (31).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	153	Immunohistochemical analysis of liver sections demonstrated that the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained significant levels of hepatically localized apoE, whereas the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model did not.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely originated mostly from hepatocytes, as the expression pattern of the hypomorphic Apoe allele in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model is normal, with the liver producing the majority of apoE in these mice (30).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model originated in the periphery.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	156	The higher plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model relative to those in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, despite similarly low apoE plasma levels, is consistent with a more efficient clearance of remnants in the hepatocyte-derived model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model accumulated 2-fold more plasma cholesterol and 4-fold more plasma triglycerides than the hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The 8-fold greater accumulation of apoB48-containing remnants in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model is also consistent with the site of apoE synthesis influencing remnant clearance, despite both models having similar levels of plasma apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, low levels of hepatic apoE synthesis overcome to a significant degree the deficiency in remnant clearance seen in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In contrast to wild-type mice and similar to Apoe/ mice, both models had equally low levels of plasma apoB100.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The low levels of plasma apoE in the two models apparently failed to sufficiently enrich apoB48-containing remnants with apoE, causing them to become poor competitors with apoB100-containing LDL for binding to the LDLR.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	162	Alternatively, the reduced levels of apoB100 in both models may result from decreased apoB100 secretion by the liver.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, hepatic apoE expression has been reported to influence the production rate of both apoB48 and apoB100 in mice (35).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The finding that the levels of apoB48 are far greater in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model than in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, emphasizes the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE in remnant clearance, as the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model likely secretes reduced levels of apoB48, similar to Apoe/ mice (35).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Thus, a direct assessment of apoB secretion rates in both models will be necessary to confirm this possibility.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Lastly, remnant clearance in both models may have been influenced by the recently described recycling pathway of apoE in liver hepatocytes (36).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, as only 6% of internalized apoE was reported to be re-secreted by hepatocytes, the pathway likely plays a minor role in mediating remnant clearance in our models that have very low levels of plasma apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	168	Directly comparing remnant clearance in both the hepatocyte-derived and non-hepatocyte-derived apoE models confirmed the conclusions drawn from the steady-state plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, which indicate that hepatocyte-derived apoE is more effective than non-hepatocyte-derived apoE in remnant clearance.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	169	 When compared with wild-type mice, the initial phase of remnant clearance was similarly reduced in both mouse models and comparable with apoE null mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	170	 As the initial phase likely reflects the binding and sequestration of remnants on hepatocyte cell surfaces in the space of Disse, the levels of apoE molecules per remnant as well as the levels of hepatically localized apoE in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model do not appear to contribute significantly to this process.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Moreover, the differences in lipoprotein pool sizes in the models did not affect the rapid initial clearance of remnants.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, the near normal level of remnant clearance after 3 h only in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, suggests that hepatically derived and localized apoE contribute substantially to a slower component of remnant clearance, which likely represents liver-uptake.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Indeed, livers from the hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained 70  plus or minus  5% of normal 125I levels, whereas livers from the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model contained only 38  plus or minus  4%.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	174	In the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, apoE-poor remnants sequestered on hepatocytes likely become enriched with newly secreted apoE in the space of Disse or by the passive exchange from existing hepatically localized apoE, allowing for accelerated receptor-mediated internalization through the LDLR and the LRP or through HSPG alone.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, in the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model, a large proportion of sequestered apoE-poor remnants likely redistribute to and accumulate in the circulation due to the absence of apoE-enrichment in the space of Disse and inefficient receptor-mediated uptake.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	176	Studies of remnant clearance in an isolated mouse liver perfusion model have recently questioned the importance of hepatic synthesis and localization of apoE and thus the importance of the secretion-capture role of apoE in remnant clearance (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Livers from Apoe/ mice cleared an infused bolus of apoE-containing rat chylomicron remnants as efficiently as those from wild-type mice, which, unlike livers from Apoe/ mice, had abundant levels of apoE localized on hepatocyte cell surfaces (24).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	178	 More recent data from this model suggested that apoE/HSPG interactions on hepatocyte cell surfaces are not required for efficient remnant uptake (29).
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Rather, apoE/LRP interactions were proposed to mediate the direct sequestration and internalization of remnants.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	180	Interestingly, and in parallel to the results observed in the mouse liver perfusion model (24), the absence of hepatically localized apoE in both the non-hepatocyte-derived apoE model and in Apoe/ mice did not influence the early phase of remnant clearance relative to the hepatocyte-derived apoE model.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Indeed, all three of these mouse models displayed similarly delayed initial rates of remnant clearance relative to wild-type mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, a shortcoming of the liver-perfusion model is that the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to explain the steady-state levels of remnants in mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	183	 For example, in apoE null mice, the perfused liver effectively cleared an infused bolus of remnants, whereas at steady-state the mice accumulate remnants in plasma.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In contrast, our in vivo models directly focus on the steady-state levels of remnants in mice.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	185	In conclusion, this in vivo study in mice expressing apoE from hepatic versus extrahepatic sources demonstrates and underscores the importance of hepatically derived and localized apoE for efficient remnant clearance by the liver.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Because remnant clearance operates close to its sub-optimal level in the hepatocyte-derived apoE model, the model should be informative in revealing the relative contributions of the LDLR and the LRP in remnant clearance in the context of low levels of plasma apoE.
0.37510666.12551940.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The hepatocyte-derived apoE model can also serve to determine the contribution of other proteins known to be ligands for remnant clearance such as hepatic lipase (37, 38).

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	7	Aims To assess the role of the APOE gene in the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	8	Method We studied the APOE genotypes of 24 adults with dementia and 33 non-demented adults with Down's syndrome over 35 years of age, and an additional group of 164 non-learning disabled adults.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We also carried out a meta-analysis of all previously published studies of association between APOE and Down's syndrome, incorporating the current data.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	10	Results We observed a non-significant excess of APOE 4 and a reduction of 2 in adults with dementia compared with non-demented adults with Down's syndrome in our sample.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, meta-analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of 4 in adults with dementia compared with non-demented adults with Down's syndrome (odds ratio=2.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Saunders et al (1993) reported an association between APOE 4 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A number of studies have produced inconsistent support for APOE 4 as a risk factor and APOE 2 as a protective factor against Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's syndrome (Prasher et al, 1997; Tyrell et al, 1998).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Our study examined whether the age specific manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome was influenced by risk factors such as age, APOE status, and genotype for an intronic polymorphism in the PS-1 gene, which is also reputedly associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease (Kehoe et al, 1996).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We examined the APOE polymorphism in three groups: (a) a population-based sample of adults with dementia with Down's syndrome aged 35 years and over; (b) an elderly group of non-demented adults with Down's syndrome drawn from the same population-based sample; and (c) a group of normal non-demented adults selected for intelligence, collected from the same geographical area as the first two groups.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We also carried out a meta-analysis comprising all published studies of association between the APOE gene and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome, incorporating the data from the current study.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Subjects were assessed for Alzheimer's disease using the ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1992) criteria in accordance with the guidelines produced by an international consensus panel established under the auspices of the Ageing Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities (IASSID) (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The diagnosis of dementia was further supported by using two observer-rated questionnaires, namely the Dementia Questionnaire for Mentally Retarded Persons (DMR) (Evenhuis, 1992) and the Dementia Scale for Down's syndrome (DSDS) (Gedye, 1995).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Both questionnaires are reported to have good inter-rater reliability and internal validity (Evenhuis, 1992; Gedye, 1995).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Deb  and  Braganza (1999) have recently reported a positive correlation between diagnosis of dementia by a clinician in adults with Down's syndrome and diagnosis carried out according to the DSDS criteria (specificity=0.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	28	The age of onset of dementia was determined by asking the carers of adults with Down's syndrome when clinical symptoms of dementia were first noticed.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Diagnosis of Down's syndrome was based on the characteristic clinical features and no karyotyping was carried out.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The level of intellectual disability was determined either on the basis of IQ scores or the assessment of adaptive behaviours.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	31	We excluded adults with Down's syndrome who showed medical, psychiatric, neurological or laboratory characteristics not related to Alzheimer's disease, but which might explain their mental deterioration, in particular severe hearing loss, untreated hypothyroidism and depression (n=2).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In all, 24 adults with Down's syndrome who had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease were included in this study.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We ascertained a second group of 33 individuals, identified as the oldest adults from a list of non-demented adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	34	 As the prevalence of dementia in adults with Down's syndrome tends to increase with age (Lai  and  Williams, 1989), it is anticipated that those who have lived longer without manifesting clinical dementia have least risk factors for developing dementia, and therefore provides an appropriate group for comparison.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Finally, a control group of 164 non-demented adults representative of the local population and unselected for intelligence were used (54% male, mean age 38.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Multiple logistic regression analysis was also carried out to estimate the relative influence of risk factors such as age, gender, APOE and PS-1 genotype on the development of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The Woolf method (Woolf, 1955) was used to perform a meta-analysis of association between APOE genotype and Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	42	 A Mann-Whitney U-test was used to test for a relationship between APOE and the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This was done because of Sekijama et al's (1998) finding that the frequency of 4 allele in Down's syndrome adults with Alzheimer's disease under 50 years was significantly higher (28.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The presence of dementia was only significantly related to age in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	67	To assess the influence of APOE 4 on the age of onset of dementia in adults with Down's syndrome we compared the mean age of onset between those who had an 4 allele and those who did not.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The mean age of onset of dementia among 4 positive cases (at least one 4 allele) was 51 years and 53 years for those who did not have an 4 allele.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	69	 A comparison of ages of onset in those with and without an 4 allele was not statistically significant.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	70	Meta-analysis Prasher et al (1997) presented a meta-analysis of the data collected from all the known published papers in addition to their own data in relation to APOE status in adults with Down's syndrome with and without Alzheimer's disease.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We have added data from two other recent studies (Sekijama et al, 1998; Tyrell et al, 1998), and our current study to those analysed by Prasher et al (1997) and this is presented in Table 4.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, we excluded Wisniewski et al's (1995) data, which were included in Prasher et al's (1997) meta-analysis, because unlike all the other studies they diagnosed Alzheimer's disease on the basis of neuropathological findings alone in the absence of any clinical data.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The previous meta-analysis (Prasher et al, 1997) did not show a statistically significant difference in the distribution of APOE alleles between the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome and the non-demented adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, the meta-analysis in the current study showed a statistically significant excess of APOE 4 in Down's syndrome cases with Alzheimer's disease compared with those without (odds ratio=2.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	80	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   The current study We observed a higher frequency of the APOE 4 allele among subjects with dementia and Down's syndrome compared with those without dementia, although this trend was not statistically significant.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Similarly a slightly lower frequency of the protective 2 alleles was observed among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The small cohort size of the current study reduced the statistical power for this study (24% power at 5% level) to detect an effect size of that reported previously.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	83	 However, in this study the age-matching of two groups of patients with Down's syndrome one of which had dementia, was done in such a way so as to increase its sensitivity and thus lessen the influence of this statistical weakness.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	84	Meta-analysis To increase the possibility of detecting small effect sizes, we collated data from all known published studies of association between APOE status in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This was the method employed recently by Prasher et al (1997) that showed no evidence to support an involvement of APOE.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, the meta-analysis reported here, showed a statistically significant excess of the APOE 4 allele among the subjects with dementia when compared with the non-demented group of adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, we did not observe a significant reduction of APOE 2 alleles among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	88	Certain factors may have influenced the outcome of the meta-analysis in the current study as well as in Prasher et al's (1997) study.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	89	 It is likely that the age difference in the cohorts used in the previous studies (Table 4) is a factor that may have introduced errors into the results of meta-analysis.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The age range of subjects included in these studies varied, in that some used age 18 whereas others used age 35, 40 and 50 respectively as the minimum age for inclusion in the study.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If APOE is responsible for earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease, this differential rate of age range among the different cohorts will make the interpretation of meta-analysis difficult.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The lack of appropriately matched control group is another likely source of bias.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Only the current study, Tyrell et al's (1998) study and van Gool et al's (1995) study matched the dementia group with the non-dementia group.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Prasher et al's (1997) study while not originally matched demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the age and the gender distribution.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The cohort size is also a likely source of error.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Apart from the current study, only two other studies (see Table 4) included 20 or more adults with dementia in their cohort.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Another source of error is the use of different diagnostic criteria for defining dementia in different studies.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Some used formal tools like the DMR scale (Evenhuis, 1992) and Adaptive Behaviour Scale (Nihira et al, 1974), whereas others made their diagnosis on the basis of clinical findings alone.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	99	Age of onset of Alzheimer's disease In the current study, a regression analysis unequivocally showed an influence of ageing on the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Age is a well-known risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease in both the general population and in the adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This effect seems more pronounced among the adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Some have suggested that age of death among adults with Down's syndrome is influenced by the APOE status.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In Hardy et al's (1994) autopsy study, the Down's syndrome cases showing Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and who had an APOE 4 (n=10) allele, tended to die at a younger age (age of death ranged between 48 and 60 years, mean 54, s.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	104	=6) than those who had an 2 allele (n=2) (age of death 69 and 76 years respectively).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A similar trend was also reported by both Royston et al (1994) and Mann et al (1995) based on their small cohort studies.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Some suggested that APOE status also influences the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the general population (Corder et al, 1993).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, the findings of the current study do not suggest such trend among cases of Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Considering the small cohort size included for the analysis of age of onset data in the current study, a Type II error is likely to influence the out-come.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	109	 As early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease could be difficult to detect in adults with Down's syndrome, it is difficult to be precise about the exact age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in this cohort.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	110	The frequency of APOE 4 allele distribution among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome in different studies mentioned in Table 4 varied between 12.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	111	4%, apart from Prasher et al's (1997) study, which showed a much lower (5.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	112	9%) frequency than that expected in the general population.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In contrast, the frequency of APOE 2 alleles varied widely between 0% in the current study, and that of Schupf et al's (1996) and Tyrell et al's (1998), to the 11.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	114	8% observed in Prasher et al's (1997) study, which is higher than expected even for the general population.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The frequency of 2 allele among the non-demented subjects with Down's syndrome was on average much higher than that expected in the general population, with a wide range between 2.

0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Overall these data are indicative of APOE 4 being a risk factor for the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	118	APOE 4 and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in Down's syndrome The findings of autopsy studies of patients with Down's syndrome, however, show a somewhat unclear relationship between APOE 4 and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in this population.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	119	 For example, in Wisniewski et al's (1995) autopsy study of brains of 40 subjects with Down's syndrome (of whom 15 showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology), only one 21-year-old subject had an APOE 4 allele (34 genotype) and his brain did not show the Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In Mann et al's (1995) study of 20 brains of subjects with Down's syndrome, all of whom showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, only 35% (n=7) had APOE 4 allele (one with 24 and six with 34).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Similarly, in Hardy et al's (1994) series of 22 autopsy brains of subjects with Down's syndrome, all of whom showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, 45% (n=10) had APOE 4 (all with 34 allele).
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Further research is needed to clarify this apparent discrepancy perhaps by using immunoneuropathological techniques.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	123	 It is also important to explore the exact mechanism by which APOE 4 may influence the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome subjects.
0.3418416.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, it is well known that despite the increased risk associated with the 4 allele, the presence of 4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of Alzheimer's disease (Blacker  and  Tanzi, 1998).
