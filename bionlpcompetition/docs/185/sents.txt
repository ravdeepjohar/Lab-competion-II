0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The existence of a large number of contributing loci and gene-gene as well as gene-environment interactions make it difficult to identify the disease genes underlying these complex traits.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In mouse models of obesity and Type II diabetes such as the murine fat mutation, genetic crosses can be used to dissect the genetic complexity influencing the observed phenotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The underlying defect in the fat mutant is a Ser202Pro change in carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme responsible for the final proteolytic processing step of prohormone intermediates.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	7	 On the HRS/J (HRS) inbred strain background, mice homozygous for the fat mutation exhibit early onset hyperinsulinemia followed by postpubertal moderate obesity without hyperglycemia.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In contrast, on the C57BLKS/J (BKS) genetic background, fat/fat mice become severely obese, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperglycemic.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, in the Cpefat genetic model, the fat mutation is necessary but not sufficient for the development of obesity, Type II diabetes, and related metabolic disorders.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	10	 To dissect the susceptibility loci responsible for modifying obesity- and diabetes-associated traits, we characterized, both genetically and phenotypically, fat/fat male progeny from a large intercross between BKS.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Four major loci were mapped, including a locus for body weight (body weight 1) on chromosome 14; a locus for hyperglycemia (fat-induced diabetes 1) on chromosome 19; a locus for hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypercholesterolemia (fat-induced diabetes 2) on chromosome 5; and a locus for adiposity and body weight (fat-induced adiposity 1) on chromosome 11.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The identification of these interacting genetic determinants for obesity and Type II diabetes may allow better definition of the obesity/diabetes-related hormone signaling pathways and ultimately may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of these complex diseases.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Presumably, the genetic dissection of these complex traits in humans has been difficult because of their polygenic nature, the genetic heterogeneity, and gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions on the disease traits (4, 7, 23).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For this reason, genetic studies of obesity and diabetes have extended to the use of mouse models.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The mouse constitutes a useful model system because a large number of animals can be bred while controlling for genetic and environmental influences.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These advantages are necessary to study the epistatic effects of mutated genes on susceptibility loci.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	19	Five single-gene mutations that result in an obese phenotype have been identified in mice, one of which is the fat mutation.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The fat mutation is a single nucleotide change in the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) gene resulting in a 202Ser to Pro change in the CPE protein in fat mice (22).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The CPE gene (Cpe) encodes an enzyme responsible for the processing of hormones, such as insulin and proopiomelanocortin.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	22	 CPE is present at high concentrations in secretory granules of the pancreatic islets and is required for the excision of residual dibasic residues remaining at the carboxy-terminal end of propeptides after processing by the endolytic prohormone convertases PCSK1 and PCSK2 (10).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The mutation in Cpefat renders the enzyme unstable, and it is ultimately degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The reduction in CPE activity in turn leads to a decrease of biologically active hormones such as insulin.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	25	 CPE defects have also been observed in other tissues, including the hypothalamus, which suggests that a number of additional prohormones may be implicated in the obesity phenotype such as neuropeptides, melanin-stimulating hormone (3), or melanin-concentrating hormone (25).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	26	The fat mutation initially arose on the inbred HRS/J (HRS) strain (7).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	27	 HRS-fat/fat mice exhibit early chronic hyperinsulinemia followed by mature onset obesity without hyperglycemia.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	28	 When the fat mutation was transferred to the C57BLKS/J (BKS) background, male mice harboring the mutation in a homozygous state became hyperglycemic after the sixth backcross generation (N6).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In addition, BKS-fat/fat mice exhibit elevated plasma triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	30	 As the background strain difference with respect to diabetes development demonstrates, Cpefat is necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of diabesity (obesity/diabetes) in the Cpefat model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Other susceptibility loci must interact with fat to produce the hyperglycemia and other metabolic phenotypes observed in BKS-fat/fat mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To dissect the susceptibility loci interacting with Cpefat, we performed a genetic analysis of male mice homozygous for the Cpefat mutation from a large (BKS x HRShr/+ or +/+) F1 Cpefat/+ intercross [the inbred HRS strain also carries a mutation in the hairless gene (hr)].
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	33	 For temporal phenotypes such as body weight and plasma glucose, we constructed sets of derived phenotypes to capture key aspects of longitudinal measurements such as rate, flux, and severity of each phenotype.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Here, we present the outcome of a genome-wide screen for susceptibility loci that interact with Cpefat in the development of obesity- and diabetes-related disorders.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To determine HDL-cholesterol levels, low-density and very-low-density lipoprotein particles were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (15).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	53	 To determine plasma triglyceride levels, free glycerol was subtracted from the total glycerol content.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Plasma glucose levels were monitored biweekly, whereas lipid and insulin levels were determined at 16 wk of age and at termination.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Subcutaneous (rostral and caudal), retroperitoneal, and epididymal fat pads were isolated and weighed at termination.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Total fat pad weights were defined as the sum of the fat pads described here.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Adiposity indexes were calculated by dividing the total fat pad weight by carcass weight and multiplying by 100.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In addition to fat pad weights, body lengths (nose to tail) and girths of all animals were measured.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	60	 DNA was isolated from tail tissue by using proteinase K digestion and salt precipitation (28).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Because Cpefat and hr were segregating in the F2 intercross progeny, DNAs were PCR amplified with allele-specific primers to determine the genotypes at both loci.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	62	 PCR conditions for Cpe primers have been previously described (19).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Cycling conditions for PCR-amplification of hr were as follows: 94 degrees C for 2 min followed by 49 cycles of 94 degrees C for 20 s, 50 degrees C for 30 s, and 72 degrees C for 30 s.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	70	 DNA from heterozygous hr/+ animals yielded two fragments of 910 and 581 bps, respectively.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	71	 To identify polymorphic regions between the BKS and HRS strains across the genome, DNA from parental BKS-fat/fat N6, BKS-fat/fat N10, and HRS-+/+ mice was typed for single stranded length polymorphism (SSLP) markers (Research Genetics) using PCR assays as previously described (14).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Initially, a total of 87 SSLP markers at an average spacing of 20 cM was tested for the genome scan, with the largest gap being 47 cM between markers D1Mit26 and D1Mit17 (marker information available upon request).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Additional markers were tested for chromosomal regions showing significant linkage.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	74	 At this resolution, we detected (1/87 markers tested in the scan) a region on chromosome 17 that differed between BKS-fat/fat N6 and N10 animals.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	75	 N6 animals were all HRS genotype at D17Mit142, whereas N10 animals were segregating with HRS and BKS alleles.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Because these areas and other HRS contaminated regions may exist [up to 2% of the genome (2)], a BKS-modifying QTL may have been missed.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Of the 2,838 F2 mice generated from the intercross, DNA from 282 fat/fat F2 male progeny was PCR amplified.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Only 10% of fat/fat male mice instead of the expected 12.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	79	5% were available because some mice died early or were lost before the completion of the study.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Approximately, 83% of all possible genotypes were complete.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	81	 To determine whether a QTL modified a trait in absence of the Cpe defect, a genome scan was performed on DNA from 48 F2-fat/+ and 24 F2-+/+ mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	82	Statistical Analysis Before data analysis, our data were thoroughly examined for mice exhibiting spontaneous, extraneous ailments such as malocclusions.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	83	 These animals were removed from the data set before analysis.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The phenotypic profiles of the F2 progeny were obtained using one-way ANOVA.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In examining the longitudinal data of the male F2-fat/fat mice, we noted different patterns of disease progression.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	86	 For example, some mice became hyperglycemic early and sustained their hyperglycemia, others were transiently hyperglycemic, and others showed a slow but moderate rise in plasma glucose levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	87	 To address the longitudinal nature of our phenotypes, we created derived phenotypes for body weight and plasma glucose.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This allowed us to obtain results that have a clear biological interpretation, i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	89	, to detect modifiers that act early or late in the disease process (change), that affect the rate of disease progression (curvature), that affect disease severity (final), or that remain constitutively expressed throughout the time course (average).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This also makes our results comparable with future studies that may measure body weight progression at different time points or even at irregular time intervals.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We constructed the following sets of derived phenotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Let bi be the log body weight at week i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Let gi be the log plasma glucose level of the mouse at week i.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Termination age, the time at which necropsies are performed, differed between cohorts (24 or 30 wk of age).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We statistically examined whether there was a difference in mean values between necropsies done at 24 versus 30 wk.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The adiposity indexes measured at 24 and 30 wk of age were not significantly different (P = 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Therefore, in our genome scan analysis, we combined adiposity data for all cohorts to increase the power to detect linkage.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	98	 To adjust for this, we included an additive effect for cohort in our analyses of adiposity.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	102	 A one-dimensional genome scan, also commonly referred to as a genome scan, is a survey of all single-locus models explaining the phenotype.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This amounts to performing an ANOVA at every locus when complete genotype information is available.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We examine how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every locus and summarize the statistical evidence that a locus affects the phenotype by the LOD score.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A two-dimensional genome scan is a survey of all two-locus models explaining the phenotype.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Here, we examined how much phenotypic variation can be explained by genetic variation at every pair of loci in the genome.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	107	 For both one-dimensional and two-dimensional scans, we included an additive cohort effect for the three cohorts of mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This method of analysis is able to combine the overall evidence in favor of a locus in all three cohorts while respecting their differences.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The rationale for the combining of crosses has been previously reported and used in other studies (1, 8, 17, 31).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Genotypes from chromosome 8 (linked to the fat mutation) and distal chromosome 17 (cohort I and II animals) were all HRS genotype and hence excluded from the genome analysis.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	111	 After the genome scans, a two-stage model selection procedure was followed.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Locus and locus pair selection have been previously described (29).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	113	 All loci that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional scans were selected.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	114	 We selected locus pairs as follows.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	115	 All pairs that cleared the 5% permutation test threshold in the two-dimensional scan for the full two-locus model were subjected to secondary tests.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	116	 To determine whether both loci in a pair were acting additively, we compared the two-locus additive model to both single locus models dropping each locus in turn.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	117	 For the comparison, we used a nominal P value of 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This corresponds approximately to the 5% permutation test threshold for the one-dimensional genome scan.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	119	 We then tested the interaction component of the two-locus model using a nominal P value of 0.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This corresponds to a 5% permutation test threshold for the interaction test only.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Backward elimination has been previously described (5).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	122	 All loci and locus pairs selected in the previous stage were put together in a multiple-QTL model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The additive cohort effect was always included in the multiple-QTL model.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The multiple-QTL model was formed by selecting the marker closest to the locus.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	125	 If there were genotypes missing at the markers, the multiple-imputation method (26) was used to account for the missing genotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The basic idea is that the missing genotypes can be probabilistically inferred from the genotypes of nearby markers.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This is done by simulating the missing genotype at the marker conditional on the flanking typed markers.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	128	 To account for the uncertainty in our knowledge of the true genotypes, a number of imputations (26) were used.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Each term in the model (including the cohort effect) was dropped, and the change in the LOD score was noted.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	130	 (This corresponds to a type III ANOVA.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	131	) If the nominal P value of the change in the LOD score was  > 0.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	133	0001 for the interactions, that term was dropped.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This procedure was continued until no term could be dropped.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	135	To test whether the major QTLs were specific to the fat/fat animals, we performed an ANOVA test on the fat/fat and non-fat/fat male progeny.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	136	 We selected the nearest typed marker in both fat/fat and non-fat/fat progeny.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Table 2 summarizes the mean values of metabolic features examined in F2 progeny from cohort I.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Increased adiposity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypercholesteremia were all observed in fat/fat homozygotes compared with fat/+ heterozygous and wild-type mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The significant difference in the means of the physiological parameters observed between F2 fat/fat, fat/+, and +/+ progeny and the large variation in the F2 fat/fat progeny suggest that background genes are playing an important role in modifying the trait phenotypes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In addition, the fact that HRS-fat/fat mice do not exhibit elevated plasma glucose (7) further supports the idea that Cpefat is necessary but not sufficient for the development of diabesity in mouse models carrying a Cpe defect.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In general, fat/fat mice had significantly higher body weights than the fat/+ and +/+ mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	159	 A heterozygous effect for body weight in fat/+ mice was not evident over the time period examined.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	160	 As expected, adiposity indexes in fat/fat mutant mice were much higher than in nonobese (+/+) controls.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Whereas fat/+ mice tended toward higher adiposity levels, they were not significantly different from their normal (+/+) littermates.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	190	 QTL analysis of the individual fat pad weights detected QTLs for rostral, caudal, and epididymal fat pads in the same region on chromosome 11.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Mice homozygous for the BKS-derived allele at D11Mit242 had significantly higher fat depot weights (Fig.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In all F2 male progeny, a major locus for body weight (bwt1) was identified on chromosome 14, tightly linked to hr.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	193	 To determine the effects of hr on various traits in F2 intercross progeny, fat/fat, fat/+, and +/+ mice were genotyped with allele-specific primers for the hr mutation, and mean values for all traits were compared (Table 5).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In all three genetic subgroups, mice homozygous for the hr mutation had significantly reduced body weight measurements, which suggests that bwt1 is acting independently of fat on body weight.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In addition, fat/fat, fat/+, and +/+ hr mice all had lowered total cholesterol and plasma insulin levels (not shown).

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	198	 That is, heterozygosity on chromosome 18 had the strongest epistatic effect on body weight in mice homozygous for the HRS-derived allele of bwt1 (Fig.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Two loci for Cpefat-induced diabetes (find1 and find2) were detected on chromosomes 19 and 5, respectively (Fig.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	205	 For find2, mice homozygous for BKS-derived alleles (BB) exhibited higher plasma glucose levels than their BH and homozygous HH littermates, whereas for find1, the presence of a HRS allele resulted in elevated plasma glucose levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The find2 locus was found to affect other metabolic features besides plasma glucose such as insulin and total cholesterol levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	207	 With the use of the backward elimination, multiple-QTL model, no locus, including find2, was identified as having an interaction with find1.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The fact that no significant interaction was detected with find1 was surprising because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become diabetic.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Because hr is segregated in the crosses, we hypothesized that the find1 effect on plasma glucose may be dependent on the hr genotype on chromosome 14.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	210	 We compared the plasma glucose means of mice homozygous for the HRS-derived allele at find1 with two genotypic cohorts, BB and HH, at D14Mit115, a marker tightly linked to the hr locus (Table 6).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	211	 As suspected, mice homozygous for the HRS-derived allele at find1 and homozygous for the BKS-derived allele at D14Mit115 had significantly higher plasma glucose levels than mice homozygous for the HRS-derived alleles at both find1 and D14Mit115.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	215	Evaluation of Major QTL on Fat/+ and +/+ Progeny To determine whether the major QTL identified acted as modifiers of the Cpefat mutation, we performed ANOVAs on the QTL marker genotype separately for fat/fat and non-fat/fat male intercross progeny (Table 7).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	216	 As in the fat/fat mice, a significant effect was also observed with bwt1 in fat/+ and +/+ mice with D14Mit5, a marker linked to the hr locus.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, none of the other QTLs (find1, find2, and fina1) showed a strong effect in non-fat/fat male progeny, which is consistent with the modifier hypothesis.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Orexin knockout mice exhibit a narcoleptic phenotype, which suggests that orexin may function in the regulation of the arousal and sleep-wake cycle (6).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	222	 However, intraventricular injection of orexin peptide increases feeding in C57BL/6J mice (18).

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Mutation analysis in the coding regions of Hcrt and Cpd mRNA in HRS and BKS mice detected no sequence differences.

0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	226	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   Obesity is a complex, multifactorial disease in the human population often associated with increased susceptibility to comorbidities such as Type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension (30).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	227	HRS-fat/fat mice and resistance of HRS-fat/fat mice to Type II diabetes make the mutant fat mouse a useful model to study gene interactions in the development of diabesity.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In this study, two major loci for hyperglycemia (find2 and find1) were identified on chromosomes 5 and 19, respectively.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	229	 F2 fat/fat mice that are homozygous for the BKS-derived allele of find2 have an increased susceptibility and mice that are homozygous for the HRS-derived allele are resistant to hyperglycemia.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Hence, we hypothesize that find2 may be the locus that protects HRS-fat/fat mice from developing diabetes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	231	 It has been known previously that the BKS genetic background is diabetogenic (7).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	232	 In a C57BLKS/J x C57BL/6J-Leprdb/Leprdb intercross, two putative loci for hyperglycemia were identified on chromosomes 8 and 17, but no QTL was detected on chromosome 5 (21).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This disparity may be due to differences in how the db and fat mutations are interacting with the BKS background.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Alternatively, the chromosome 8 locus may lie close to the Cpe locus, and the BKS.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	235	HRS mice used here may not carry it.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In addition, only a subset of mice was analyzed in the BKS x B6 intercross (20% of highest plasma glucose and lowest plasma glucose levels), and thus the find2 locus on chromosome 5 locus may have been missed.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	237	(BKS x HRS) F2 fat/fat mice that are homozygous for the HRS allele at find1 have elevated plasma glucose levels.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Because HRS-fat/fat mice do not become hyperglycemic, this implies that find1 is interacting with additional loci from the BKS background.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Our multiple-QTL model did not detect a locus interacting with find1; however, we did observe an association between plasma glucose levels of mice homozygous (HH) at find1 and their genotype near the hr locus on chromosome 14.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This suggests that the hr gene (or a closely linked gene) may have an effect on find1 expression.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	241	 In addition, loci closely linked to the Cpe locus on chromosome 8 cannot be ruled out, because all mice analyzed were homozygous Cpefat.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Diabetes susceptibility loci have been found in the same interval as find1 on distal mouse chromosome 19 in several rodent experiments (11, 12, 16, 27).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Whether all of these loci are due to mutations in the same gene remains to be determined.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	244	A major QTL for body weight (bwt1) was identified on chromosome 14.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The LOD peak of bwt1 is in close vicinity to hr, making hr a plausible candidate.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Allele typing of the hr allele in the F2 progeny showed that hr/hr mutant mice had significantly lower mean body weight values than haired (+/+) mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Hairless HRS mice (HRS-hr/hr mice) also have lower mean adipose depot and body weights than their normally haired albino (HRS-+/+) littermates (20).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	248	 It has previously been shown that hairless mice have a higher metabolic rate than normally haired albino mice (9).
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	249	 This was attributed to greater energy requirement for thermoregulation in mice lacking body hair.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, it was recently discovered that the hr gene product acts as a corepressor to the thyroid hormone receptor (24), and the hr mutation might, therefore, mimic some of the effects of thyroid hormone on energy metabolism.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Altogether, our data suggest that hr is responsible for the lowered body weight in HRS-hr/hr mice and that the hr gene itself explains some of the variance observed in F2 fat/fat males and acts independently of the fat locus.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	252	 There are currently no published reports on adiposity in human patients with congenital alopecia or artrichia carrying mutations in the Hr gene, so that it is unclear whether hr mutations have the same effect on metabolism in humans as in mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	253	A major locus (fina1) on chromosome 11 was strongly associated with adiposity in the genome scan of the F2 fat/fat mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The fact that fina1 was not observed in lean controls implies that the fina1 locus is epistatically interacting with fat, thereby, masking the effects of hr on adipose depot distribution in F2 fat/fat mutant mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The interval for fina1 is still fairly large but includes intriguing candidates such as Hcrt and Cpd.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Although no sequence variations were observed in the coding regions of both genes, the possibility of promoter defects needs further exploration.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	257	In this study, we carried out a genetic analysis of the complex phenotype caused by the prohormone processing defect in fat mutant mice.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	258	 We use a novel method of analyzing modifier genes involved in different patterns of disease progression such as rate, fluctuation, and severity.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	259	 We also show that many of the phenotypes observed in fat mice can be ameliorated by the action of major modifier genes.
0.20854747.15870393.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Because obesity is often associated with alterations in neuropeptide levels, the identification of these diabesity-associated modifier QTL should also lead to a better understanding of the biological pathways and neuropeptides that may be involved in common forms of obesity.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	5	 REFERENCES   A better understanding of the allelic structure of common human disease loci may help identification of the responsible genes, and is thus a topic of considerable practical importance.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	6	 If few alleles at each locus account for the majority of disease risk, then screening for these causative factors will be greatly simplified.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, if large numbers of independent alleles are responsible, dramatic improvements in genotyping speed will be necessary, placing the dream of personalized medicine far in the future.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In this review, the evidence for and against the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints is discussed.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It appears that neither position has been proved or disproved, but the available evidence indicates that common diseases are due at least in part to genes with a small number of disease-associated alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	10	One of the early dreams of the human genome project was the goal of personalized medicine.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The vision was that each individual would have a compact disk containing their own unique DNA sequence, guiding myriad decisions on lifestyle, disease prevention, treatment and conceivably even career choice.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	12	 At present, DNA sequencing technology is nowhere near cheap enough or fast enough to allow this dream.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Nevertheless, genotyping technologies have made dramatic strides over the last decade, and these technologies may now be fast enough to allow interrogation of all relevant disease alleles in any given individual.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The feasibility of this approach depends critically on the allelic structure of human disease genes.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	15	 If all 30 000 genes make important contributions to disease susceptibility, and there are 1000 alleles for each gene, then a total of 3x107 genotypings will have to be reliably performed a daunting prospect.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, if only 1000 genes make appreciable contributions to human disease, and each of these genes has only 4 relevant alleles, then the number of genotypings to be performed is only 4000 highly feasible.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In this review, we look at the present knowledge on the allelic complexity of human disease genes, as well as providing a brief glance to the future.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	20	 REFERENCES   A perhaps oversimplified aid to visualizing the properties of human disease genes is provided in Figure 1.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This figure depicts a three-dimensional allelic space, with the axes of disease frequency, number of responsible loci and mean number of alleles at each locus.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Regarding the second axis, number of responsible loci, genetic traits are traditionally divided into monogenic (single gene or simple trait), polygenic (many genes), and multifactorial or complex (interactions between multiple genes and environment).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Because a single locus is responsible for the monogenic disorders, identification of the relevant loci is usually straightforward, provided that a sufficient number of multiplex families are available.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In contrast, the genetics of complex traits remains murky, and success in identifying the responsible loci has been elusive.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This is because many genes and environment conspire together in a series of complicated epistatic and synergistic relationships to cause the final disease phenotype.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In general, the number of loci identified through linkage for any given complex disease trait is less than 10, but linkage can be expected to identify only the major contributing loci.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Since, with very few exceptions, the genes responsible for complex traits have yet to be identified, it remains an open question as to the number of alleles at each locus.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For monogenic disorders, rare diseases (green bar) have complex allelic spectra (high number of alleles per locus), while common diseases (yellow bar) have simple spectra (low number of alleles per locus).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Special cases (gray bar) exist in situations such as heterozygous advantage and population bottlenecks.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For common complex disease traits, the situation is less clear.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Two extreme models are the interaction model (CD/CV hypothesis, dark blue bar) and the genetic heterogeneity model (red bar).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two other extreme models are also formally possible: a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), and a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles (magenta bar).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Considerations of human population genetics (2) suggest that one of the four extreme models, a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles (cyan bar), is unlikely.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, present data are insufficient to confidently place complex disease traits between the remaining three extremes, indicated by the two-dimensional gray surface.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this figure, the following examples are employed (2, 10): monogenic (rare) retinoblastoma; monogenic (common) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (South China); monogenic (special case) ss-thalassemia (Sardinia); complex (interaction model) Alzheimer's disease (speculative); complex (genetic heterogeneity model) colon cancer (speculative).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	38	 No known examples yet exist for the two hypothetical cases of common complex diseases caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles or a large number of loci each with a large number of alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	39	 For clarity, the disease frequencies for both the monogenic and common complex disorders have been rounded to 10-1, but all are within one order of magnitude of the known frequency.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In the cases of the complex diseases, Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer, the assigned values for the number of loci and the number of alleles per locus are highly speculative.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	41	 For the purposes of the figure, it has been assumed that Alzheimer's disease is an example of the interaction model, whereas colon cancer is an example of the genetic heterogeneity model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Although both assumptions are conjectural, there is some evidence in favor of the genetic heterogeneity model for cancer (10).
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	43	  Two extreme models are usually envisaged for complex disease traits (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	44	 One idea is that common alleles at a handful of loci interact to cause disease.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This is referred to as the interaction model or the common disease/common variant (CD/CV) hypothesis.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The competing notion is that rare alleles at numerous loci can each single-handedly cause the disease.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This is referred to as the genetic heterogeneity model.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Two other extreme models are also formally possible: complex disease traits are caused by a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles, or they are caused by a large number of loci with a large number of alleles (Fig.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	49	 One of these last two alternatives (a small number of loci each with a large number of alleles) is rendered unlikely by considerations of human population structure (see below).

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	59	 For the rare disease, the number of individuals in the expanded population is still small, and hence in relative terms they are quickly swamped by newly mutated alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In contrast, the population reservoir for the common disease gene is large, and it takes a long time for these alleles to be taken over by new mutations.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In addition, in the face of similar mutation rates, the lower prevalence of rare diseases implies a higher allele disappearance rate (negative selection) for these diseases than for common diseases.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Both of these effects (reservoir effect and selection pressure) imply that after the population expansion, allelic spectra became diverse much more quickly for the rare diseases than the common.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Because the rare disease gene is under strong negative selection, three alleles disappear in the population, and are replaced by three new alleles.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Thus, only 2/5 (40%) of alleles represent the ancestral allele.
0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In contrast, the common disease gene is under much less strong negative selection, and only one allele is lost to be replaced by three new alleles.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Consequently, the common disease gene has a much simpler allelic structure in the present population than the rare gene.

0.14565748.12351581.html.plaintext.txt	76	 However, in the far distant future (at equilibrium), the common disease gene can be expected to catch up with the rare gene, and the allelic spectra of both genes will be equally diverse.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Plasma levels of ghrelin are dependent on food intake and increase in sleeping subjects during the early part of the night.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	6	 It is unknown whether sleep itself affects ghrelin levels or whether circadian networks are involved.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Therefore, we studied the effect of sleep deprivation on nocturnal ghrelin secretion.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In healthy male volunteers, plasma levels of ghrelin, cortisol, and human growth hormone (hGH) were measured during two experimental sessions of 24 h each: once when the subjects were allowed to sleep between 2300 and 0700 and once when they were kept awake throughout the night.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	9	 During sleep, ghrelin levels increased during the early part of the night and decreased in the morning.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This nocturnal increase was blunted during sleep deprivation, and ghrelin levels increased only slightly until the early morning.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep correlated positively with peak hGH concentrations.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We conclude that the nocturnal increase in ghrelin levels is more likely to be caused by sleep-associated processes than by circadian influences.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	13	 During the first hours of sleep, ghrelin might promote sleep-associated hGH secretion and contribute to the promotion of SWS.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Ghrelin is synthesized mainly in stomach endocrine cells but has also been identified in other tissues, including the hypothalamus (7, 10, 12).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, increases food intake and appetite, and promotes body weight gain (17, 37, 38).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recent findings suggest that ghrelin might be involved in the regulation of sleep in humans by promoting slow-wave sleep (SWS) (35).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	19	Plasma ghrelin levels increase during fasting and decline within 1 h after food intake (4).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, ghrelin levels have been observed to increase during the night in sleeping subjects and to decrease in the morning some hours before awakening and, thus, before breakfast (4).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	21	This time course in sleeping subjects suggests the existence of a mechanism regulating ghrelin production that is not dependent on food intake.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Possible candidates are the circadian rhythms regulating numerous endocrine networks, such as, for example, the secretion of cortisol or leptin (5, 13), which, in turn, are related to insulin and blood glucose levels (27).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Alternatively, sleep might directly influence ghrelin production, as it has been demonstrated, for example, for the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary (28).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	24	To dissect diurnal variations from sleep-related influences on ghrelin production, we performed a study on the 24-h pattern of ghrelin secretion in healthy males.

0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	102	 We confirmed the finding of Cummings et al.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	103	 (4) that in sleeping subjects ghrelin levels rise during the early part of the night and decline in the morning before breakfast.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We discovered, however, that this increase is blunted by sleep deprivation.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	105	 When subjects stayed awake, ghrelin levels rose slowly and steadily to reach a plateau in the early morning and did not decrease until breakfast.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This relative increase of 25% during nocturnal wakefulness was similar to the effects of a 12-h fast observed during the day (1).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The suppressive effect of sleep deprivation on ghrelin levels suggests that the bell-shaped time course observed during sleep might not be due to an influence of circadian rhythms but rather might be related to sleep itself.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Hence, nocturnal ghrelin secretion shows similarities to hGH production, which is promoted by sleep as well, and particularly by sleep onset (3).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In addition, peak hGH levels correlated positively to ghrelin secretion during the first hours of sleep (Fig.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	110	 2), further supporting the idea of a tight interaction.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	111	Sleep-related growth hormone secretion is probably caused by an increased production of hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) acting on the pituitary (28).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Ghrelin, in contrast, is produced mainly by the stomach and other splanchnic organs (1, 14).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Small quantities might also be produced in the hypothalamus (for review see Ref.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	114	 9), but these are very unlikely to contribute to systemic levels (34).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Hence, it is almost certain that the increased ghrelin levels that we found in sleeping subjects are due to peripheral production.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Yet it is unclear at present how the brain might act on ghrelin-producing cells.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Despite the positive correlation between ghrelin and hGH secretion, a causative role of hGH is unlikely, because a number of studies demonstrated that hGH administration does not affect ghrelin levels (2, 8, 16, 30).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Studies investigating the interaction between ghrelin production and feeding suggest an influence of vagal cholinergic efferents on ghrelin production and transmission of the ghrelin signal to the brain through vagal afferents (29, 30).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These studies indicate a negative influence of the vagus on ghrelin secretion.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Therefore, the increased parasympathetic tone occurring during sleep (30) is unlikely to explain increased ghrelin secretion, because the opposite would rather be expected.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Hence, although the present results clearly demonstrate increased ghrelin levels during sleep, the question remains to be solved how the sleeping brain stimulates ghrelin secretion.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	122	 At first glance, it is not easy to understand why the production of an appetite-stimulating hormone should be increased during sleep.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	123	 However, the interaction among metabolic, endocrine, and sleep-regulating networks is complex, and ghrelin has numerous functions.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Ghrelin has recently been shown to increase SWS, and this effect is probably dependent on the GHRH receptor (33, 35).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Therefore, ghrelin might represent a peripheral feed-forward signal to support SWS initiation and/or maintenance during the first hours of night sleep in concert with central SWS-promoting actions of GHRH (18).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Similarly, ghrelin being a potent growth hormone secretagogue (11) might reinforce the central GHRH signal for enhanced hGH production.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This idea is supported by the correlation between hGH and ghrelin production shown in Fig.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Studies on the interactions between sleep and neuroendocrine factors date back to the late 1960s (e.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	129	 31), but it was only very recently that a particularly intriguing link between sleep and the regulation of appetite became evident.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Orexins, hypothalamic peptides that were initially thought mainly to regulate food intake but also to have potent arousing properties (21), play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (a sudden, short-lasting loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions), and an acquired complete loss of hypothalamic orexin production in the hypothalamus in most patients (21).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In addition to sleep-related symptoms, patients display various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and hypoleptinemia (23 to 25).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Like ghrelin plasma levels, orexin cerebrospinal fluid levels are increased at night (6), and ghrelin-induced food intake is mediated by orexinergic pathways (22).
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Therefore, it might be of great interest to investigate ghrelin under baseline conditions, in association with sleep and sleep deprivation and in association with meals in narcoleptic patients.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	135	 To conclude, ghrelin production is enhanced during night sleep in healthy humans and correlates with the increased release of hGH occurring in parallel.
0.12693419.14871884.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the present study further supports the idea that ghrelin is a novel, important player within the sleep-neuroendocrine interplay.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	8	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the gene encoding huntingtin, a protein of unknown function.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutant huntingtin forms intracellular aggregates and is associated with neuronal death in select brain regions.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The most studied mouse model (R6/2) of HD replicates many features of the disease, but has been reported to exhibit only very little neuronal death.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We describe for the first time a dramatic atrophy and loss of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Importantly, we also found a significant atrophy and loss of orexin neurons in Huntington patients.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Like animal models and patients with impaired orexin function, the R6/2 mice were narcoleptic.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Both the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid were reduced by 72% in end-stage R6/2 mice compared with wild-type littermates, suggesting that orexin could be used as a biomarker reflecting neurodegeneration.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Our results show that the loss of orexin is a novel and potentially very important pathology in HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by personality changes, motor disturbances, cognitive decline and weight loss (1).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It is caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin (2), a protein with unclear function, albeit essential for cell survival during development (3) and in adult life (4).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Descriptions of the neuropathology emphasize neurodegeneration in the neostriatum and cerebral cortex, with the appearance of intraneuronal aggregates of misfolded huntingtin (5,6).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, significant neuronal death has also been described in the tuber nucleus of the lateral hypothalamus (7,8).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	20	The most studied animal model of HD is the R6/2 mouse, which expresses exon 1 of the human mutant HD gene with 150 CAG repeats (9).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In advanced stages, these mice display several clinical features reminiscent of HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These include impaired motor coordination, tremor, changes in open field behavior, progressive weight loss and increased incidence of epileptic seizures (10).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	23	 For unclear reasons, they die prematurely at the age of 12 to 15 weeks.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Their brains exhibit a high frequency of intraneuronal nuclear inclusions of the polyglutamine-containing protein.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	25	 So far, relatively little cell death, with only few scattered neurons undergoing  dark degeneration , has been described (11,12).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	26	Neuropathological studies of end-stage HD patients have demonstrated up to 90% neuronal loss in the tuber nucleus of the lateral hypothalamus (7,8).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In humans, this region is particularly enriched in NMDA receptors (13).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This implicates the involvement of excitotoxic cell death, which has repeatedly been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of HD in other brain regions (1,14).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Interestingly, a recent study showed that in slice cultures of rat lateral hypothalamus, neurons containing the peptide orexin (also known as hypocretin) are particularly susceptible to excitotoxic damage (15).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Orexin A and B are synthesized from the same precursor gene and are expressed in the same neurons with their cell bodies concentrated to the lateral hypothalamus (16,17).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These neurons project widely throughout the central nervous system with particular dense projections to monoaminergic centers.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	32	 They are thought to interact with autonomic, neuroendocrine and arousal systems through excitatory effects of orexin (reviewed in 18).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Importantly, studies in mice with a null mutation of the gene for orexin (19) or one of its receptors (20) as well as transgenic mice with a targeted ablation of orexin neurons (21) revealed severe disturbances of sleep and wakefulness, similar to narcoleptic symptoms in humans (22).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Subsequent studies have shown that most human narcolepsy patients have reduced levels of orexin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (23) and that, in some cases, the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus is reduced (24).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Taken together, these findings strongly implicate the orexin system in sleep regulation.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	36	Here we describe, for the first time, a progressive loss of orexin neurons, with ultrastructural signs of neurodegeneration, in the lateral hypothalamus of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Importantly, we have also observed a significant reduction in the number of orexin-positive neurons as well as a significant atrophy of the remaining orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of HD patients.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We also report a significant reduction of orexin levels in R6/2 mouse CSF, which suggests that measuring CSF levels of orexin in HD patients could be a novel means to assess disease progression and the potential effect of novel therapies.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	100	 All the R6/2 mice that were studied (n=3) showed episodes of no movement (5 to 9 episodes per mouse, group median=7).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Two of the animals also exhibited abrupt and sudden changes of posture, and interestingly, all three mice displayed what we interpreted as narcoleptic episodes with complete falls onto the side (4 to 5 falls per mouse, group median=4) (Fig.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	102	 These episodes were followed by sudden bouts of locomotion, which typically were hyperactive compared with those in wild-type control mice.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Interestingly, during the light phase of their diurnal cycle, R6/2 mice generally spent less time sleeping than wild-type mice, but they exhibited repeated, sudden episodes of behavioral arrest, sometimes associated with an abrupt change of posture.

0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This is also true for the R6/2 mouse, which has been reported to exhibit only minor cell loss in the neostriatum and the cerebral cortex (11,12), besides a loss of retinal cells (26).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The paucity of intracerebral neuronal death in R6/2 mice suggests that the mouse model is a poor analogy to HD patients.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Consequently, the clinical relevance of the R6/2 mouse has been questioned.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Nevertheless, it is currently the most widely used mouse model in HD research and there are over 20 published reports testing novel therapies in this model (27).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Now, for the first time, we demonstrate progressive neuronal loss in the brains of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The neuronal population is located in the lateral hypothalamus and contains orexin.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	129	 We also found a significant depletion of orexin in hypothalamic tissue samples, where the cell bodies are located, and in the other parts of the brain that receive orexin projections, including the pineal region.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Importantly, there was also a significant loss and atrophy of orexin-immunostained neurons in the lateral hypothalamus of HD patients, extending earlier reports of a loss of unidentified neurons in this structure in HD (7).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In the small number of HD brains examined in our study, there was no obvious correlation between the Vonsattel grade and the loss of orexin neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The Vonsattel scale for neuropathological changes is based on cell loss in the striatum (28) and it is not a given that the degenerative changes in the hypothalamus follow a similar time course.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Whether hypothalamic cell death, including orexin loss, occurs early in the human disease and whether it is correlated with motor, cognitive, sleep and weight loss symptoms, remain to be studied.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	134	What are the connections between the narcoleptic-like episodes and the loss of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus in R6/2 mice? Deficits in orexin neurotransmission are known to result in behavior reminiscent of narcolepsy in mice and dogs (19 to 21,29).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Interestingly, the frequency, duration and general appearance of the narcoleptic episodes seen in R6/2 mice are very similar to those observed in genetically modified mice lacking orexin or carrying mutant orexin receptors (19 to 21).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Furthermore, there is a correlation between the progressive loss of orexin neurons and the gradual onset of the narcoleptic phenotype in R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Taken together, the striking motor arrests in R6/2 mice are likely a direct consequence of the observed loss of orexin neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	138	Why is there a loss of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons in HD and the R6/2 mouse model? Clearly, they are sensitive to the expression of an expanded polyglutamine protein, as mouse and rat models expressing an ataxin-3 construct with an increased number of CAG repeats, under the control of the orexin promoter, exhibited adult onset degeneration of the hypothalamic orexin neurons (21,30).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Possibly, the expanded polyglutamine stretches disturb functions of crucial interacting proteins.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Thus, huntingtin associated protein-1 (HAP-1), a partner for huntingtin with unknown function, is enriched in the hypothalamus and null mutant mice for HAP-1 die early owing to impaired feeding and exhibit hypothalamic degeneration (31).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In the same study, a transgenic mouse model expressing the first 171 amino acids of huntingtin with 82 glutamines (N171 to 82Q mice) also showed HAP-1 depletion and degeneration of neurons in the hypothalamus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Although the transmitter identity of the dying neurons in these models was not established, the degenerative phenomena included the lateral hypothalamus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Another explanation for the selective vulnerability of hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons may be related to their expression of NMDA receptors.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Recently, it was shown that exposure of rat hypothalamic cultures to excitotoxicity resulted in a specific loss of orexin neurons (15).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Excitotoxicity has been widely regarded as a likely contributor to cell death in HD (1,14).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	146	 There is evidence for functional changes in glutamatergic pathways in the R6/2 mice at several levels: from release, transmitter inactivation and receptor composition, to intracellular signaling in neurons receiving glutamatergic input (32 to 37).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Despite this, there is little cell death in the striatum of R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Possibly, the striatal neurons gradually develop resistance to damage due to protracted low-grade excitotoxic stress (38).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The resistance to acute excitotoxic damage is correlated to the number of neurons exhibiting intranuclear inclusions in the R6/2 striatum (35) and this proportion is generally lower in the lateral hypothalamus (57% in this study) compared with the striatum ( > 95%) (39).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	150	What are the implications of our findings? Characterization of the death of orexin neurons may shed light on the cellular events leading to neuronal death in HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In addition, monitoring the loss of orexin-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus may also be an important index to measure therapeutic efficacy of novel drugs in R6/2 mice.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Changes in sleep behavior and the occurrence of narcoleptic episodes constitute a functional outcome parameter to follow.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Although no studies showing that the HD patients actually suffer from symptoms similar to narcolepsy have been reported so far, sleep patterns are disturbed (40).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Indeed, HD patients have an abnormal sleep/wake cycle, and R6/2 mice exhibit a progressive disruption of circadian rhythms caused by dysregulation of circadian rhythm genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus (J.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Morton, personal communication).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Importantly, we have found that orexin fibers are lost in the R6/2 pineal region, which is involved in regulating the circadian rhythm via connections with the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	157	In HD, there are no state biomarkers available.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	158	 As plasma or CSF measurements of substances secreted from sites of neuropathology such as the hypothalamus are feasible, the identification of an affected neuronal subpopulation opens up new possibilities to identify such a marker.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In end-stage R6/2 mice, both the number of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and the levels of orexin in the CSF were reduced by 72% compared with wild-type littermates.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This suggests that orexin could be used as a biomarker reflecting hypothalamic neurodegeneration.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Considering the substantial loss and atrophy of orexin also in the human condition, we hypothesize that symptomatic HD patients have reduced CSF orexin levels below the levels considered diagnostic for narcolepsy.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In healthy individuals, the normal orexin values in CSF are  > 200 pg/ml.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Orexin levels  < 110 pg/ml are diagnostic for narcolepsy (41).
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Can one predict a similar decrease in HD patients? Our study shows that HD patients of Vonsattel grade II to III with around 43 CAG repeats (i.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	165	 mild to moderate cases), have completely lost 30% of the orexin neurons.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The remaining 70% neurons have undergone an atrophy of the neuronal cross-sectional area by 40% (representing an even greater percentage loss in the volume of each cell), which taken together suggest a reduction in total cell volume (both atrophy and cell death considered) that would lead to a reduction in CSF levels of orexin below the diagnostic levels for narcolepsy.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Considering this scenario, CSF orexin levels could constitute a novel biomarker to assess disease progression and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in HD.
0.30595517.15525658.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Currently, such a biomarker is lacking in HD.

0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We mapped two distinct X-linked retinal disorders to this region, and found disease-associated mutations in RPGR exon ORF15.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The specificity of the mutations is confirmed by finding no other sequence abnormalities in the characterized RPGR transcripts (18 and present study).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Additionally, we scanned for the presence of the mutations in 137 dogs (211 chromosomes) of 20 different breeds, and found deletions only in XLPRA1 (Siberian husky and Samoyed) or XLPRA2 (mongrel-derived) affected or carrier dogs, thus confirming that the mutations are not polymorphisms.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We also scanned 20 wolves (29 chromosomes; 19 red wolves and 1 black wolf), and only found the deletion in two aged heterozygous red wolves that were asymptomatic.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Based on the lack of a retinal disease phenotype in these females, the deletion is likely to be a rare, benign polymorphism (8).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	220	A  hotspot  for RPGR mutations in humans occurs in an approximately 1 kb purine-rich region of exon ORF15, in which out-of-frame mutations and premature stop are associated with disease.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Of the 34 novel RP3 mutations reported recently, 23 were one-, two-, four- and five-nucleotide deletions that resulted in a frameshift with premature termination of translation (8).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It was proposed that the purine-rich region may adopt unusual non B-DNA conformations and show sequence motifs similar to DNA polymerase- arrest sites found near other deletion hotspots; this can lead to microdeletions following slipped-strand mispairing events (21,22).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	223	 We have found similar microdeletions in the present study, suggesting that RPGR exon ORF15 appears to be a mutation hotspot in canids.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	224	Our studies demonstrate that the nature of the RPGR exon ORF15 deletions determine the retinal phenotype.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Both disorders are distinct, and have remained so even though the diseases now are present in mixed-breed dogs of the same genetic background.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This indicates that the phenotype results from differences between the two mutant proteins in vivo.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The normal retinal development in XLPRA1 argues that the C-terminal 230 amino acids encoded by exon ORF15 are not vital for functional and structural differentiation of rods and cones.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The same argument has been proposed for the role of the RCC1-like domain since photoreceptor development is normal in the Rpgr knockout mouse (9).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, the severe disease that develops in young adult animals indicates that RPGR plays an essential role in photoreceptor viability.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In contrast, the abnormal retinal development that occurs in XLPRA2, and the rapid degeneration that ensues, suggests that the mutation disrupts the critical differentiation of rods and cones, and causes their early degeneration.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	231	Analysis of the heterozygous retinas provides insights into the role of the mutant alleles in retinal development and maintenance.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Through random X-inactivation (23), approximately 50% of the retinal cells express the mutant or normal RPGR, and the expression of the mutant gene can be examined in the milieu where half of the photoreceptors are genetically normal.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Carriers of either disease show ophthalmoscopically visible patchy retinal degeneration  to  an indication of mosaicism, the hallmark of retinal random X-inactivation (24).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These changes, which are variable in extent and severity, are evident in most carriers by the time they are young adults, and in all by the time they are advanced in age.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	235	 These abnormalities are stationary in XLPRA1, but some XLPRA2 carriers often show progressive disease that results in advanced retinal degeneration by 5 to 6 years of age or older.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In contrast, lack of any disease in aged heterozygous red wolves suggests that the three-nucleotide deletion is a benign polymorphism.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	237	The severe retinal disease phenotype in canine XLPRA is comparable to what has been reported for human patients with RPGR mutations, given the caveat that, at least in humans, only a limited number of phenotype to genotype correlation studies have been reported.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	238	 With the exception of two reports that, retrospectively, represent mutations in exon ORF15 (25,26), all others have been limited primarily to exons 1 to 10 (e.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	239	 These studies show comparably severe clinical phenotypes in XLRP patients to those found in the two canine models.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Also, the majority of carriers show clinical disease varying from mild to severe [impaired night vision or visual field loss (3,24)].
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	241	 In some families, the disease was sufficiently severe in females to be considered semidominant (28).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Examination of exon ORF15 in these has identified null alleles in four of nine families (J.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Rozet, personal communication, 26 July 2001).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	244	Expression studies of RPGR have shown that alternative splicing is complex, and species-specific variants may exist.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The splice variants reported for RPGR are mainly after exon 13, especially in the brain and testes (18,25).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Additionally, alternative exon usage of introns has been found frequently for RPGR transcripts; for example exon 14a (intron 14) in mouse (25) and dog (18), exons 15a, 15b1, 15b2 and ORF15 (intron 15) in human, mouse, cow and dog (8 and present study), and exon 19a in mouse [intron 18 (25)].
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The alternative splicing and exon usage suggests that different RPGR protein isoforms are produced for specific functions in vivo.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The exon 16 to 19 probe mainly detected an 8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	249	9 kb band, but failed to detect the 5 kb band that was recognized with probes for exons 3 to 10, exon 14a and ORF15.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This result suggests that exon ORF15 can be used as a terminal exon (5 kb band), or alternatively spliced to exons 16 to 19 (8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	251	 We have found a putative consensus splice donor site, conserved between human and dog, located before the stop codon in the 3' coding region of exon ORF15.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This may splice exon ORF15 to exons 16 to 19, and translate the polypeptide in frame to include most of exon ORF15 and exons 16 to 19.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In this case, the putative protein will regain the C-terminal isoprenylation site ( to CTIL) located in alternative terminal exon 19 (2).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	254	Higher-molecular-weight mRNA bands have been reported previously, including 3.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	255	5 and 20 kb in eye and brain (25 and present study).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Recently, a 6 kb band has been reported for human retina with both ORF15 and exon 3 to 19 probes (29).
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	257	9 kb band has no match to known sizes of RPGR sequences.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This suggests that additional undiscovered exon(s) or alternative polyadenylation sites are used in RPGR processing.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In addition, with the exon ORF15 probe, we consistently detected two bands with similar intensity, 8.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	260	9 kb and another of slightly smaller size (Fig.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	261	 6A), which suggests that different splice variants may exist.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The spatial relevance of the predominant 5 kb splice variant expressed in retina, and the mutations found in exon ORF15, may explain why the observed phenotype is confined to the retina.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	263	The transfection data emphasize the differences in expression profiles between the two mutant exon ORF15 proteins.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In vitro, the XLPRA1 premature stop mutant behaves similarly to the wild-type protein, whereas the XLPRA2 frameshift protein aggregates in the ER compartment.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In examining the transfection results, we attach no significance to the presence or absence of GFP nuclear labeling, since it may result from protein cleavage in a small proportion of constructs so that GFP enters the nucleus, or a weak nuclear localization in the vector.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Aggregation of XLPRA2 mutant exon ORF15 protein may result from the additional abnormal residues, which impair proper folding.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The in vitro results are consistent with the phenotypic differences found in the two diseases.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Based on the presence of retinal transcripts with exon ORF15 in both normal and XLPRA mutant retinas, and the very different phenotypes of the two diseases, we propose that the XLPRA1 mutation causes a loss of function that is not critical for visual cells during development, but is essential later for their sustained viability.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	269	 In contrast, the XLPRA2 mutation affects photoreceptors early in development, and has devastating consequences for the retina.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	270	The results of our studies highlight the importance of RPGR exon ORF15 in photoreceptor function and viability.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	271	 They indicate that very different retinal phenotypes can result from mutations in this novel exon, a situation that is similar in human RP3 families.
0.11429769.11978759.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Finally, we show the value of the canine model, and the tools available for comparative genomic analysis, to aid in understanding gene function and diseases that are of importance to humans and other species.

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Both peptides derive from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, which is identical with the independently cloned prepro-hypocretin (2).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Prepro-orexin is selectively expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area, a region involved in the control of feeding behavior (1, 2).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Consequently, orexins were shown to stimulate food intake in rats when injected into the brain ventricles and prepro-orexin mRNA was up-regulated in the lateral hypothalamus by fasting (1).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Orexin (hypocretin)-containing neurons project to numerous areas throughout the brain and the spinal cord, suggesting the involvement of orexins in the regulation of multiple physiological functions besides their effect on feeding behavior (3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These areas include the cerebral cortex, limbic system, locus coeruleus, and brain stem regions but also the hypothalamus itself.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Accordingly, orexins were shown to regulate autonomic functions like heart rate and blood pressure (8, 9), sleep-wake behavior and arousal (10, 11, 12), and various neuroendocrine systems (13, 14, 15, 16).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	23	Two subtypes of orexin receptors, namely OX1 and OX2 receptors, were cloned (1).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Their expression patterns in the rat brain are in good agreement with the widespread projections of orexin immunoreactive neurons (17, 18).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Within the hypothalamus, OX1 receptor mRNA was detected in areas like the medial preoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus, whereas OX2 receptor mRNA was found in regions such as the paraventricular and the arcuate nucleus (18).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Therefore, the effects of intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected orexins on plasma hormones such as ACTH, prolactin, LH, and GH (13, 14, 15, 16) may be mediated by affecting the synthesis and/or liberation of releasing hormones.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, orexins may directly influence pituitary hormones because orexinergic nerve fibers are present in the median eminence and pituitary gland and orexin receptors were detected in the pituitary gland (4, 19, 20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Indeed, orexins were shown to stimulate CRH and GnRH release from the hypothalamus (21) but also to inhibit releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH and LH release from the pituitary (22, 23).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The inhibitory action of orexin on GnRH-stimulated pituitary LH release was observed only in proestrous female rats and not in male rats (22).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Moreover, in female rats the effect of icv-injected orexins was dependent on the status of ovarian steroids (16).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Furthermore, whereas in ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated with 17ss-estradiol (E2) and progesterone icv orexin increased plasma LH levels, in untreated OVX rats orexin decreased plasma LH levels (16).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	32	 One explanation for this bimodal action of orexins on LH release is a possible regulation of orexin receptors by estrogens.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Interestingly, we have recently detected a sexually dimorphic expression of peripheral orexin receptors with higher mRNA levels of OX1 receptors in the pituitary and of OX2 receptors in adrenal glands of male rats when compared with female rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	34	To clarify the effect of gonadal steroids on the orexin system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of prepro-orexin as well as OX1 and OX2 receptors in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands of sham-operated and gonadectomized male and female rats and the influence of subsequent E2 or T treatment using quantitative real-time PCR.

0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	144	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We have recently found profound differences in the mRNA levels of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors between male and female rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In addition, the mRNA expression of hypothalamic prepro-orexin was higher in female rats (27).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Our present results confirm the expression of OX1 receptors in the pituitary and OX2 receptors in the adrenal gland (20, 28, 29, 30, 31).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Furthermore, we show for the first time that gonadal steroids affect the mRNA expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors in the pituitary and adrenal glands.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The up-regulation by ovariectomy and down-regulation by E2 of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors in female rats is in accordance with the much lower mRNA levels of these receptors in intact female rats compared with male rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In addition, T up-regulated adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA in male rats, whereas pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA was down-regulated.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Thus, the lower pituitary OX1 receptor mRNA levels in female rats (20) may be explained by inhibitory actions of E2 in female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In the adrenal, both inhibitory actions of E2 in female rats and stimulatory actions of T in male rats may contribute to the differences of OX2 receptor mRNA levels between female and male rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	152	In addition to their effects on energy homeostasis, there is considerable evidence that orexins can regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (16, 22, 32, 33, 34).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Icv injected orexins increased plasma LH concentrations in ovarian steroid-treated female rats, whereas in untreated OVX rats plasma LH was reduced as initially shown by Pu et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This bimodal response appears, in part, to be mediated by GnRH because orexin stimulates GnRH release from hypothalamic explants of male and proestrous female rats (21, 22).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In addition, orexin containing neurons project to several hypothalamic nuclei including areas involved in the regulation of GnRH where orexin receptors are present (3, 4, 35, 36).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	156	 However, because orexin receptors are also present in the pituitary gland, a direct effect of orexins can be assumed.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In ovarian steroid-treated rats, the stimulatory effect of icv orexins on pituitary LH release was observed already at low doses, whereas a high dose of orexin was necessary to suppress the release of LH in the absence of ovarian steroids (16, 32).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	158	 It could be possible that orexins, when injected icv at high doses, reach the pituitary gland by diffusion into the portal circulation and stimulate pituitary OX1 receptors, which are up-regulated in the absence of ovarian steroids as shown by our results.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Although, there was no significant effect of orexin on basal LH release from dispersed pituitary cells, orexin inhibited GnRH-induced release of LH from isolated pituitary cells in proestrous female rats (22).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Thus, orexins may differentially regulate the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis by exerting contrary effects on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These estrogen-dependent bimodal actions of orexins on LH release in female rats may be caused by the up-regulation of OX1 receptors at low E2 levels.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Such a receptor-dependent regulation of hormone-release is well established for other peptides such as angiotensin II (37, 38).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	163	In addition to the effect on GnRH-induced LH release, other direct actions of orexin on the pituitary gland are possible.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Although no effects of orexins on basal ACTH were observed in male and female rats, Samson and Taylor (23) reported an inhibitory effect of orexins on CRH-stimulated ACTH release in vitro.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This finding is supported by the localization of orexin receptors in human corticotrope pituitary cells (30).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Interestingly, the ACTH response to stress depends on gonadal steroids in both male and female rats (39, 40).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The role of orexins in these responses remains unclear.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, our findings of a strong regulation of pituitary OX1 receptors by E2 and, to a lesser degree, by T, imply a so far undefined hormonal regulation of orexin actions in the pituitary gland of male and female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	169	In the adrenal gland, we found very high mRNA levels of OX2 receptors in accordance with our previous findings which also showed much higher amounts of OX2 receptor mRNA in male rats compared with female rats (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Interestingly, gonadal hormones differentially affected the mRNA levels of adrenal OX2 receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	171	 E2 reduced the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors, whereas T increased the mRNA levels of OX2 receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Therefore, both E2 in female rats and T in male rats may contribute to the observed sex differences in adrenal OX2 receptor mRNA expression.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Inconsistent data exist regarding the localization of adrenal orexin receptors.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In rats, OX1 and OX2 receptor like immunoreactivity was found in the adrenal medulla but not in the cortex (28).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In contrast, quantitative PCR showed much higher levels of OX2 receptor mRNA, which was selectively localized in the adrenal cortex of the rat by in situ hybridization (20).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	176	 These results are supported by findings of Randeva et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	177	 (31), who found OX2 receptors but not OX1 receptors selectively in the cortex of human adrenals using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunostaining.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Others, however, have described OX1 receptors in the cortex and OX2 receptors in the medulla of the human adrenal (41).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Because orexins stimulate adrenal glucocorticoid release in rats and humans (42, 43) and glucocorticoids play an unique role in energy homeostasis, it is intriguing to speculate that in male rats orexins may regulate glucose metabolism via regulation of glucocorticoids.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Interestingly, we found increased levels of plasma orexin A by T in male rats in contrast to female rats where plasma orexin A levels were unchanged by E2.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Further experiments are needed to clarify possible T-dependent functions of the adrenal orexin system.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	182	Thus far, it is unclear whether, in rats, adrenal OX2 receptors are stimulated by circulating orexins or whether orexins are locally produced in the adrenal gland as described by Randeva et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The presence of orexin in plasma has been described before in rats and humans and circulating orexins may activate adrenal orexin receptors (20, 44).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Although the source of plasma orexins is currently uncertain, orexin-producing neurons project to the median eminence and may therefore contribute to plasma orexins (29).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	185	In contrast to the lower mRNA levels of orexin receptors in the pituitary and adrenal glands of female rats compared with male rats, prepro-orexin and OX1 receptor mRNA levels are elevated in the hypothalamus of female rats (20, 27).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In our present study, we could not reveal changes of hypothalamic prepro-orexin or orexin receptor mRNA after gonadectomy or hormonal treatment in male and female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Our results in female rats are in accordance with findings of Russell et al.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	188	 (22), showing no effect of estrogens on hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA in female rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In addition, in male sheep, E2 did not affect prepro-orexin mRNA levels (45).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Thus, other factors may be responsible for the observed differences between male and female rats, and it may be concluded that the central (hypothalamic) expression of prepro-orexin and orexin receptors is not under the control of ovarian steroids.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, because orexin receptor subtypes are distinctively expressed in hypothalamic nuclei (18) discrete changes of orexin receptor mRNA levels in specific hypothalamic nuclei might not be detectable by analyzing whole hypothalamic extracts using RT-PCR and cannot completely ruled out by our results.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	192	Estrogens and T have divergent effects on food intake, energy expenditure, and body weight and plasma levels of estrogens correlate positively, whereas plasma levels of T correlate negatively with body fat mass (46).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our findings of weight gain after ovariectomy is in accordance with previous observations (47).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The reduced weight in female rats after E2 replacement may be attributed to the somewhat higher plasma E2 levels in E2-treated female rats in comparison to sham-operated female rats (47).
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (48) showed that OVX could influence body weight independently of food intake and separately from central mechanisms.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In our study, the regulation of orexin receptors by gonadal steroids appears to be limited to peripheral organs.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Thus, the peripheral orexin system and particularly adrenal OX2 receptors may contribute to sex specific regulations of energy homeostasis.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	198	In summary, our results show that E2 and T differentially regulate the mRNA expression of pituitary OX1 and adrenal OX2 receptors in female and male rats.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, in addition to the ability of orexins to regulate the reproductive system, sex steroids may affect the actions of orexins.
0.27402496.12639903.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Like other peptides regulating energy homeostasis and reproductive functions (49) orexins may play an important role in coordinating these systems but may also sex dependently influence other orexin-related functions like the autonomic system and sleeping behavior.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This second search identified five genes including arginine vasopressin, POMC, Hcrt, and oxytocin, all of which have major roles in endocrine regulation in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Significantly, this high-specificity search also identified Magel2, which is developmentally regulated and inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	68	 We then formulated a third search with intermediate specificity: expression in the hypothalamus over eight times the median level of all tissues and fewer than five tissues with over three times the median level of expression.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The third search of the GNF database identified a set of 15 genes highly expressed in the hypothalamus but moderately to highly expressed in only 5 other murine tissues (Table 1, screen 1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	70	 We repeated the third search using an updated database, the 2004 version of the mouse Geneatlas.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	71	 As with the third search of the GNF database, the search of Geneatlas 2004 identified genes with high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression elsewhere in the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	72	 We then used the correlation function of the searchable Symatlas database within Geneatlas.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The Symatlas search was refined to allow either high or low expression in the preoptic region, which functionally overlaps with the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This last search, still using intermediate specificity criteria, identified 7 genes, 3 of which were identified in the GNF intermediate-specificity search (Table 1, screen 2), for a total of 19 genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Intermediate search of the GNF Gene Expression Atlas to detect genes highly expressed in the hypothalamus and expressed at low levels in most other tissues.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	76	  Selection of novel hypothalamic genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Of the 19 genes from the two searches of the GNF databases, 3 genes were identified in both searches (Table 1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Because the nature of the search engine provided by GNF changed from the 2002 release to the 2004 release, the two search criteria were not directly comparable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In common between the two searches was the requirement for high expression in the hypothalamus and low expression in other regions of the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Because we were interested in identifying genes not known to be important in the hypothalamus, we first set aside genes whose role in hypothalamic function has been well described.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	81	 These included genes encoding the neuropeptide signaling molecules Hcrt/orexin, pro-opiomelanocortin-, oxytocin, agouti-related protein, and arginine vasopressin (4).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	82	 A neuroendocrine role for calcitonin and the calcitonin receptor in growth hormone secretion in the hypothalamus/pituitary had previously been suggested (17).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	83	 We had previously identified Magel2 as specifically expressed in the developing murine hypothalamus, although its function in this tissue is not yet known (16).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Magel2 is of particular interest because its human ortholog, MAGEL2, is one of a set of genes inactivated in the genetic obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (9, 15).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Finally, mutations in Patched (Ptch1) can result in holoprosencephaly and developmental delay in humans or, alternatively, cause basal cell nervous syndrome when homozygously inactivated in somatic cells.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Ptch1 is an antagonist of the signaling molecule hedgehog, which functions in patterning of the neural tube but is not known to have a specific role in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The remaining 11 genes fell into 2 categories: 1) novel genes for which a function has been predicted by sequence similarity to known genes and 2) novel genes with no known function and no or limited similarity to known genes (Table 2).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	88	 We examined the UniGene clusters associated with these novel genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Because EST sets made from hypothalamus RNA are represented in mouse EST databases, we expected to see a representation of hypothalamic cDNAs within the Unigene clusters corresponding to these genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Indeed, all 11 genes had corresponding ESTs derived from the whole brain, with some specifically including the hypothalamus (4) or diencephalon (2) (Table 2).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The information in the UniGene clusters did not point to these genes being particularly hypothalamus specific, in contrast to the Unigene cluster for arginine vasopressin, for example, in which 12 of the 19 ESTs were derived from the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We then used the EST ProfileViewer function in Unigene to test whether the expression profile derived from ESTs overlapped with that derived from the Geneatlas databases.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Seven of the eleven novel genes had a major contribution of ESTs from the brain or pituitary gland; the hypothalamus was included as a "brain" sample in the EST Profile viewer.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In one case (Itih3), the majority of UniGene ESTs were derived from the liver, with a small minority from the brain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This is consistent with the Geneatlas distribution, which shows the highest expression of Itih3 in the liver, with most of the remaining expression in preoptic and hypothalamus samples.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In one other case (Dscr1l2), the UniGene ESTs did not distribute into any tissue-specific pattern, although an examination of the developmental timing of expression, also using the function in Unigene, demonstrated that the vast majority of ESTs were derived from the egg as opposed to preimplantation embryos or any postimplantation embryonic stage.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This is in contrast to the GeneAtlas 2004 expression profile, which shows very little tissue specificity for the Dscr1l2 transcript, and also contrasts with the GeneAtlas 2002 expression profile, which showed more specific expression in the hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Similarly, the Pitpnm1 showed conflicting expression profiles between the GeneAtlas 2002, GeneAtlas 2004, and EST ProfileViewer, with the one commonality being expression in the eye.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	99	 EST expression profile and murine gene targeting studies.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	100	  In some cases, preliminary expression patterns for the novel genes determined by RNA- or protein-based methods had already been published.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This information was most readily available from the JAX bioinformatics server, which references the original publications.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It had been proposed that Igsf1 (also known as InhBP/p120) may be involved in pituitary function, but both male and female mice mutant for Igsf1 are viable and fertile (3).

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	105	 On the basis of a mouse knockout model, Ptprz was shown to have a role in oligodendrocyte survival and in recovery from demyelinating disease (11).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Pnck (6), Nsg1 (21), and Ptpro (2) have been suggested to have roles in the developing nervous system; whereas the function of Itih3 has been studied in the liver, no function has been predicted in the brain (2).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	107	 No function has been predicted for Impact, although the human ortholog IMPACT has been suggested as a candidate gene for bipolar affective disorder (10, 14).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	108	 There was also no further information on putative function of the gene represented by the Unigene cluster Mm.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	109	 We first verified that the 11 selected genes were indeed expressed in the murine hypothalamus by RT-PCR on RNA samples from the adult mouse hypothalamus (data not shown).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	110	 We then localized the expression to specific hypothalamic nuclei by RNA in situ hybridization using a standard mouse atlas to label the sections (13).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	111	 A probe for Hcrt displayed a strong signal in the lateral anterior hypothalamus, consistent with the known abundance of RNA transcripts in this region of the brain (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Consistent with the earlier embryonic expression of Magel2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (16), we detected Magel2 transcripts in the anterior hypothalamus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We then selected four genes that emerged from the bioinformatic analysis but about which little else was known.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	114	 All four genes displayed high levels of expression in the hypothalamus compared with surrounding brain tissue by RNA in situ hybridization (Fig.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Probes for A2610042L04 and Pnck detected abundant expression in the anterior hypothalamus, whereas a probe for Dscr1l2 detected the strongest expressions in the dorsal medial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and arcuate nucleus, and a probe for Impact detected the highest expression in the arcuate nucleus.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We used NCBI databases to map the 11 selected genes to chromosomal regions in the mouse genome (NCBI build 33) and human genome (NCBI build 35) (Table 3).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	124	 We then correlated the map positions of selected genes with the genomic positions of published loci influencing obesity-related traits in either human or other mammals (23) (Table 3) updated and published on-line as "The Obesity Gene Map Database" (11a).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	125	 We identified eight traits, such as body mass index, fat mass, and percent body fat, that had been mapped to the same chromosomal regions as our selected genes in human studies of weight gain and obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We then identified cases where obesity traits had been identified as mapping within the mouse, rat, or pig chromosomal region homologous to human chromosome band(s) containing the selected genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We did not include traits that had been mapped to an interval that contained more than three chromosome bands, which would contain a very large number of candidate genes.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In this way, we identified 13 obesity-related traits in the mouse (11), rat (1), or pig (1) that correlated to the map positions of 6 of the 11 selected genes; these traits were all related to obesity and weight gain.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Except for A2610042L04, a poorly characterized predicted mouse gene on chromosome 14, all selected genes were in regions of a mammalian genome where genetic evidence for an obesity-related trait exists.

0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Previous studies designed to identify cDNAs enriched in the hypothalamus used subtractive hybridization (7) or EST cataloguing (12).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although these methods did identify genes expressed in the hypothalamus, there are intrinsic biases toward highly expressed genes in both methods; subtractive hybridization methodologies can also have intrinsic sequence-specific biases.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In contrast, high-throughput gene expression profiling provides a robust, unbiased, searchable resource that is freely available to the research community.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	135	 We examined the relative expression levels of an estimated 30,000 genes in the murine hypothalamus as determined by Affymetrix microarray technology and made available by the Novartis Research Foundation (8).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	136	 From this, we identified a set of genes not previously recognized to be important in hypothalamic function but highly and preferentially expressed in the murine hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	137	 It is exciting to think that if such a database had been available at the time that we cloned Magel2 in 1999, this analysis could have facilitated the selection of human MAGEL2 as a candidate gene for the extreme obesity seen in Prader-Willi syndrome.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	138	We identified 11 genes whose expression is enriched in the hypothalamus but which were not previously associated with the development of the hypothalamus or its function.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The candidate genes could be involved in any number of the interrelated processes partially mediated by the hypothalamus besides energy and fluid balance, such as circadian rhythm, reproduction, stress responses, and temperature regulation (1).
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The definitive proof of their involvement in obesity, rather than in other functions of the hypothalamus, would come from a demonstration of gene dysregulation in various models of obesity, including genetic and diet-induced obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We concentrated on obesity because of the large number of studies providing genetically mapped obesity-related traits, but the genes that we identified could equally well have roles in other disorders of hypothalamic function.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Other regions of the brain, including the cortex and hindbrain, have important roles in food intake (22) but have major roles in other neurological functions.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The gut, liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues also have major roles in appetite, and parallel studies could reveal novel obesity susceptibility genes that are highly and specifically expressed in those tissues but not expressed in the brain and hypothalamus.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	144	Because susceptibility to obesity is in part genetically determined, variations in these genes may contribute to familial obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The information available about the cellular and physiological function of the proteins encoded by these genes is, however, highly variable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Furthermore, the size of the intervals in which obesity traits have been mapped is also highly variable.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Further genetic and molecular studies would clarify possible roles of the candidate genes in obesity.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	148	 For example, the candidate gene located within the region where specific mouse strains or human subjects have shown genetic predisposition to obesity could be sequenced for coding or regulatory sequence variants.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These variants could then be tested in larger populations for association with obesity-related traits, including traits genetically mapped to the chromosomal intervals in which the genes reside.
0.10528083.15870395.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Finally, further investigations of the physiological and cellular functions of the proteins identified in this and other bioinformatic screens may elucidate the role of specific genes and gene products in hypothalamic function and genetic predisposition to obesity.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	11	 To date, most studies focused on the role of ghrelin in GH secretion or its function in complementing leptin action to prevent energy deficits.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The potential significance of ghrelin in the etiology of obesity and cachexia as well as in the regulation of growth processes is the subject of ongoing discussions.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	21	 References   Reverse pharmacology may be an appropriate term to describe the road to ghrelin s discovery.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	22	 First, synthetic agonists with ghrelin-like activity [GH-releasing peptides (GHRPs) and GH secretagogues (GHSs)] were discovered by Bowers and co-workers in the late seventies (9, 13, 14, 15), followed by the cloning of ghrelin-GHS-receptor (GHS-R) in 1996 by Smith and co-workers (16, 17, 18).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Subsequently, the elegant studies by Kojima and co-workers led to the identification of an acylated 28 residue peptide as an endogenous bioactive ligand for the GHS-R (8, 9, 10, 11).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It was called ghrelin, a term that contains "ghre-" as the etymological root for "growth" in many languages.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	25	 "GH" and "relin," a suffix for releasing substances in generic names according to the USP Dictionary of USAN and International Drug Names, also represents an abbreviation for "growth-hormone-release," a characteristic effect of ghrelin (8, 11).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The Ser3-acylation that seems to be responsible for bioactivity of ghrelin is a modification that has been observed for the first time in mammalian physiology.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	27	 There are no data to support the tempting speculation that the purpose of this modification is to increase ghrelin s lipophilic properties to facilitate transport across the blood brain barrier.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, the octanoyl side chain is essential for binding and activation of the GHS-R subtype-1a in vitro (19).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Ghrelin might also bind to different GHS-R subtypes or receptor families where the octanoyl side chain is not needed.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Detection and purification of the gastric enzyme responsible for the acylation of ghrelin may shed light on this fascinating question and will possibly even reveal the existence of other putative hormones carrying this modification.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	32	 References   Ghrelin is predominantly produced by the stomach (8, 20, 21, 22), whereas substantially lower amounts are derived from bowel (21, 22), pituitary (23), kidney (24), placenta (25), and hypothalamus (8, 22).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although the majority of circulating ghrelin is produced in the stomach, other sources may increase ghrelin secretion in a compensatory manner.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	34	 After gastrectomy, for example, plasma ghrelin level is surprisingly reduced only by 65% (26).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	35	One of the most urgent and debatable hypotheses is whether ghrelin is produced in physiologically relevant amounts in the hypothalamus.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This unresolved issue is the focus of several research groups.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Data published or presented at recent meetings, in accordance with our own ongoing investigations, have shown ghrelin to be present in several regions of the hypothalamus through the use of immunohistochemical detection methods (8, 22).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Depending on the ghrelin epitope recognized by the antibody in use, ghrelin-positive cells have been identified in varying hypothalamic areas, whereas all of these antisera have been successfully used in RIAs.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Detection of hypothalamic ghrelin mRNA by use of PCR has been accomplished (8); however, this issue needs to be further investigated by the detection and regional distribution of ghrelin mRNA by in situ hybridization.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	40	 At this point, it is not clear if the detection of ghrelin in the hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry reflects ghrelin peptide that is produced by hypothalamic neurons or ghrelin peptide that is derived from the stomach.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	41	 It seems logical that gastric ghrelin reflects an acute nutritional state.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, even minimal ghrelin expression in the hypothalamus (8, 12) or circulating placental ghrelin during pregnancy (25) may significantly influence food intake, nutrition partitioning, and fat utilization.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Regardless of the source, in the end it is most likely the modulation of hypothalamic circuits by ghrelin that mediates changes in energy homeostasis.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, no significant correlation seems to exist between plasma ghrelin concentrations and circulating levels of GH or IGF-I (unpublished data, Tschop et al.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	47	) even though both ghrelin and GH increase during fasting (34, 35).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Very recent data indicate that most of the ghrelin-induced GH secretion is not only directly opposed by somatostatin action, but also involves mediation through GHRH (33, 36, 37).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	49	 However, ghrelin also releases GH in vitro from primary rat pituitary cells (8, 12), and GHRP-2, a potent ghrelin receptor agonist, releases GH in vivo in patients with GHRH receptor mutations (38).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This indicates the existence of GHRH-independent effects of ghrelin on GH secretion mediated by hypophyseal GHS-Rs, which were originally cloned from the pituitary (16).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Alternatively, ghrelin may stimulate an unidentified hypothalamic agent (U-factor) that, in turn, stimulates GH release (39).

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	53	 References   The first published evidence for the involvement of ghrelin in the regulation of appetite was provided by Ghigo and co-workers (30).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	54	 They described that 3 out of 4 healthy volunteers spontaneously reported hunger following ghrelin administration as a "side effect" in a clinical study analyzing GH release (30).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This hunger-inducing effect of ghrelin has now been confirmed in two more studies, where, again, 3 out of 7 (33) and 9 out of 11 individuals report hunger as the only sensation after ghrelin injection (40).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	56	 A large number of animal studies added strength to the argument that ghrelin is involved in the regulation of energy balance.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	57	 For example, exogenous ghrelin induces adiposity in rodents by stimulating an acute increase in food intake, as well as a reduction in fat utilization (12, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Adipogenic as well as orexigenic effects of ghrelin are independent from its ability to stimulate GH secretion (12, 46) and are most likely mediated by a specific central network of neurons that is also modulated by leptin (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Regulation of ghrelin secretion, as well as its biological effects, appear to be opposite those of leptin.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	60	 However, from a teleological point of view, ghrelin and leptin might really be complementary players of one regulatory system that has developed to inform the central nervous system about the current status of acute and chronic energy balance (12, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In addition, a specific role for ghrelin might be to ensure the provision of calories that GH requires for growth and repair (41).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	62	In humans, circulating ghrelin levels are decreased in chronic (obesity) (48) and acute (caloric intake) (26, 34, 47) states of positive energy balance, whereas plasma levels of ghrelin are increased by fasting (12, 34) and in cachectic patients with anorexia nervosa (26).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Of course, it has yet to be proven that the rather modest changes in circulating ghrelin, in the 100 fmol range, have physiological relevance for hypothalamic receptor sites.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	64	 One plausible explanation is that if ghrelin is indeed a hormone signaling the need to conserve energy (12), ghrelin secretion is triggered to counter further deficit of energy storage and to prevent starvation or cachexia.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A very recent study shows a pre-meal rise of human plasma ghrelin, suggesting a possible role of ghrelin as a hunger signal triggering meal initiation (34).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In rodents, fasting and hypoglycemia increase ghrelin levels, whereas intake of food, especially carbohydrates (dextrose), decreases ghrelin secretion (12, 41, 50).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	67	 We speculate that this obvious connection between glucose levels, ghrelin secretion and GH secretion is likely to be involved in the physiological mechanism of diagnostic procedures such as oral glucose tolerance testing (for acromegaly) and insulin tolerance testing (for GH deficiency).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Differential effects of ghrelin might be mediated by separate ghrelin (GHS-R) subtypes as recently suggested by Thorner and co-workers (51).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Based on a series of elaborate studies using GHS-R antagonists ([D-Lys3]GHRP-6 and BMS-265711, also an NPY-antagonist) and an NPY-Y1-R antagonist ([D-Trp32]NPY), they showed that the orexigenic effect of ghrelin can be dissociated from its GH releasing effects, suggesting distinct GHS-R-subtypes.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Based on the observation of differential orexigenic effects of hexarelin and its analogs and GH secretagogue actions at the pituitary gland (52, 53), the existence of additional subtypes of the GHS-R (16, 17, 18) had previously been hypothesized.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The putative adipogenic effects of ghrelin in humans remains to be shown because it is possible that ghrelin has different effects on energy balance in humans and rodents.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In addition, ghrelin-induced adiposity could be only a transient effect and the therapeutic potential of ghrelin in cachectic humans might therefore turn out to be as disappointing as the efficacy of leptin for the therapy of human obesity (5, 54).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Carefully conducted clinical studies focusing on body composition as well as long-term studies on ghrelin treatment in rodents are necessary to further address this question.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Molecular analysis has shown that the primary genetic defect in these animals relates to either abolished leptin production (ob/ob mice) or impaired leptin receptors (db/db mice; fa/fa rats; leptin-R) (5, 74, 75, 76, 77).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Similar examples of obesity in humans have been found and are associated with a mutation of leptin or the leptin-receptor (78, 79, 80).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Leptin is released by adipose tissue and has been suggested to be the key-signal reflecting adipose stores.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Leptin receptors are found in the hypothalamus, particularly in the arcuate nucleus where leptin is thought to exert its primary feedback signaling (81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Recent experiments in rodents and primates have been attempting to tie together the diverse hypothalamic peptidergic systems with hormone receptors, including leptin receptors, to decipher the hypothalamic signaling modality underlying the regulation of daily energy homeostasis (81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92).

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Ghrelin, a hunger signal, is released from the stomach into the circulation and may be produced (?) in a subset of hypothalamic neurons (red).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Leptin, a satiety signal, is released from white adipose tissue (WAT) into the circulatory system.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Ghrelin (red arrows) and leptin (orange arrows) directly target the hypothalamus and brain stem areas.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	95	 While brain stem areas on this drawing are illustrated as efferent targets of hypothalamic circuits, critical pathways exists from the brain stem to the hypothalamus, as well, that can mediate ascending ghrelin and leptin signaling.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	96	 AGRP is produced in NPY cells (yellow) and acts to block the inhibitory action of the POMC derivate, -MSH (green), on feeding.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Both AGRP/NPY and POMC cells are apparent targets of direct ghrelin action via GHS-R (*).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The NPY neurons that receive lateral hypothalamic input, including HCRT (brown) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) (blue) innervation, project to a number of regions of the brain, particularly those implicated in feeding mechanisms, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), lateral hypothalamus, LH, ventromedial nucleus (VMH), perifornical region (PF), and dorsomedial nucleus (DMH).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The same regions also receive direct lateral hypothalamic input as well as innervation from -MSH cells.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	100	 These regions, in turn, project (large black arrow) widely throughout the brain to loci including the medial thalamic nuclei (MT), central gray (cg), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), locus coeruleus (LC), spinal cord, and amygdala.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Ghrelin-targeted arcuate nucleus neurons may also affect neuroendocrine cells that are responsible for the regulation of pituitary hormone secretions, including gonadotrophs (LH/FSH), TSH, ACTH, and GH.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It is yet to be determined what role central vs.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	103	 peripheral ghrelin plays in the regulation of this circuitry and at what sites and subcellular levels ghrelin signaling is interacting with that of leptin.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	104	  Peripheral ghrelin is mainly produced in the gastrointestinal tract (8, 10, 22, 23, 24).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	105	 It reaches ghrelin-receptors in the anterior pituitary and potentially in the mediobasal and mediolateral hypothalamus through the general circulation to stimulate GH release and to regulate energy homeostasis (12).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	106	 It remains to be determined whether circulating ghrelin can reach brain areas outside of the blood brain barrier only, such as the ventromedial arcuate nucleus (93), or it has the ability to target areas protected by the blood brain barrier.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Areas protected by the blood brain barrier include most hypothalamic nuclei and the rest of the brain (93).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Ghrelin-containing cells are also present in the mediobasal hypothalamus, where GHRH cells and the neuronal network that regulates energy balance are located (8, 22).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Detailed phenotypes and macroscopic connectivity of different hypothalamic networks regulating metabolism have been described by numerous recent outstanding reviews (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Among hypothalamic peptidergic circuits, particular significance is attributed to the arcuate nucleus opiate neurons that produce -MSH, a main anorexigen and energy expenditure enhancer (72), and to its interrelationship with another group of arcuate nucleus neurons that produce both NPY and an endogenous antagonist of -MSH, AGRP (69).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The interaction between these two distinct populations of cells is currently considered as a primum movens in the regulation of energy homeostasis.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, there are other peptidergic circuits within the hypothalamus, including the lateral hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin- and melanin concentrating hormone-producing cells, that appear to respond to peripheral metabolic signals and alter food intake as well as energy expenditure (65, 66, 67, 68).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In light of the aforementioned excellent reviews (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), we will avoid an in-depth description of these peptidergic systems here but will attempt to emphasize a better appreciation of the neuronal doctrine for the integration of emerging experimental data on ghrelin.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	114	In the brain, receptors for ghrelin were detected in multiple hypothalamic nuclei as well as in the hippocampus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and dorsal and median raphe nuclei (8, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	115	 In a series of experiments, Dickson and co-workers, first using synthetic GHS-R agonist, and then ghrelin, provided evidence that this novel metabolic hormone, in fact, interacts with the aforementioned hypothalamic peptidergic systems in the central regulation of metabolism (99, 100, 101, 102, 103).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	116	 For example, they found that following central ghrelin administration, c-fos, an early proto-oncogen that reflects cellular activity, is induced in the medial arcuate nucleus where NPY/AGRP cells are located (103).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	117	 It was also shown that Y1-receptor antagonists as well as melanocortin agonists and antisera to both NPY and AGRP may interfere with ghrelin s feeding-inducing effect (42, 43, 46).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, absence of NPY in genetically engineered NPY-ko mice does not diminish ghrelin-induced feeding or adiposity suggesting a key-role for AGRP in the mediation of ghrelin s effects on energy balance (12).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The effect of ghrelin on metabolism seems to be the exact opposite to that of leptin (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In obesity, when plasma leptin levels are elevated, ghrelin plasma levels are decreased indicating physiological adaptations to the positive energy balance rather than an involvement in the etiology of obesity (48, 49).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Of course, it is important to note that, while ghrelin is regulated acutely like a satiety factor, leptin levels are not regulated by meals, but rather by actual increase in adipose stores.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	123	 References   Figure 1 depicts a highly complex interaction between a variety of hypothalamic peptidergic systems, including the putative ghrelin network, in the central regulation of energy balance.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	124	 It has to be noted, however, that this drawing is not all-inclusive and represents only the "tip of the iceberg.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	125	" There are many more hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that act via the aforementioned circuits (for example coexistence of GABA with NPY; 91) or in separate pathways [for example, ciliary neurotrophic growth factor (CNTF), 104, 105 ], and are interconnected with the illustrated systems (for further review see Refs.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In addition, receptors for the different neuropeptides as well as for peripheral hormones that affect metabolism, including insulin, thyroid hormones, gonadal steroids and glucocorticoids, are also present in these regions.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	127	 During food deprivation when leptin levels rapidly decline (106) and NPY/AGRP production is elevated, but POMC neurons are suppressed (106, 107, 108, 109, 110), circulating ghrelin levels increase (12, 33, 41, 48) suggesting that leptin and ghrelin coregulate hypothalamic peptidergic systems in opposite ways.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	128	 These observations further support the hypothesis that ghrelin, as a "hunger signal," is the counterpart of leptin aiming to prevent further energy deficit.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	129	 However, considering the extreme complexity of hypothalamic interactions of different peptidergic circuits and peripheral hormone receptors, it is necessary to determine the hierarchy and direction of signaling flow within these systems to understand ghrelin s central effect on metabolic regulation.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	130	 For that, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	131	The hypothalamus is composed of a complicated set of regulatory neurons that in most cases cannot be identified by traditional means of cell segregation, i.

0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Therefore, to identify specific types of neurons, cytochemistry must be used.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In addition, as in all other brain areas, the primary mode of communication between hypothalamic peptidergic circuits is via synapses.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The only reliable way for assessing synapses is by the use of conventional electron microscopy and electrophysiology because proximity of different cells assessed by light microscopy is not a convincing indicator of neuronal interaction.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Thus, determination of the qualitative and quantitative synaptological relationship between GHS-Rs, ghrelin-producing neurons, and other key hypothalamic peptidergic systems and their receptors will be an important step for gaining insight into the hypothalamic signaling modality of ghrelin.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Of course, the anatomical experiments alone will not be sufficient to determine the actual involvement of the presynaptic ghrelin system in the regulation of the postsynaptic circuit, but provides an invaluable map that is necessary for the correct interpretation of data gathered with other tools.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In fact, anatomical studies need to be complemented by parallel electrophysiological analyses.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	139	 An elegant example of such an approach is the recent work by Cowley and colleagues (111), in which leptin s effect was analyzed on genetically tagged arcuate nucleus -MSH cells and the qualitative synaptology of these cells was simultaneously assessed.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	140	 That approach not only eliminated the pitfalls of the individual experimental techniques but immediately provided a more comprehensive view on a given hypothalamic neuronal system (111).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	141	The significance in determining the spatial relationship between different afferents using anatomical and electrophysiological tools may further be appreciated when one considers that a synapse is more potently able to affect postsynaptic cells when located proximally either on the cell body or postsynaptic dendrite than when it is located more distally.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In addition, both previous electrophysiological (111, 112, 113) and morphological observations (92, 111) indicate that an extensive interaction exists between presynaptic terminals to affect hypothalamic cells both in the arcuate nucleus where NPY/AGRP and -MSH cell bodies are located and in a model efferent target, the parvicellular paraventricular nucleus.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The impact of ghrelin on arcuate and parvicellular paraventricular nucleus neurons will be readily dependent on their synaptic organization on the postsynaptic cells and their interaction with other systems presynaptically.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	144	 One of the best examples to illustrate this synaptologic interaction is the relationship between the NPY/AGRP and -MSH systems.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Electrophysiological and anatomical observations pointed to both the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei as primary sites for the interplay between AGRP and -MSH systems (111, 114).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Because ghrelin s action appears to be mediated by the NPY/AGRP system, it is not unlikely that ghrelin will act in the arcuate nucleus as well as in the paraventricular nucleus to modulate the interaction between NPY/AGRP and -MSH.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	147	 It may be that peripheral and central ghrelin contribute equally to the regulation of both of these hypothalamic areas, but it is also conceivable that stomach-derived ghrelin affects the arcuate nucleus where the blood-brain barrier is less effective, whereas hypothalamic ghrelin is more involved in the modulation of hypothalamic sites within the blood-brain barrier, such as the paraventricular nucleus.
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	148	 An alternative and equally feasible pathway for ghrelin signaling from the stomach is via an ascending neural network through the vagus nerve and brain stem nuclei that ultimately reaches the hypothalamus (43).
0.12856172.11564668.html.plaintext.txt	149	When electrophysiological and anatomical techniques are combined with conventional physiological and molecular biological approaches, as well as with the very recently developed revolutionary tracing technique of DeFalco et al.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Mouse Sim1 is expressed in the developing kidney and central nervous system, and is essential for formation of the supraoptic and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Previous neuroanatomical and pharmacological studies have implicated the PVN in the regulation of body weight: PVN neurons express the melanocortin 4 receptor and appear to be physiological targets of -melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which inhibits food intake.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We hypothesize that haploinsufficiency of SIM1, possibly acting upstream or downstream of the melanocortin 4 receptor in the PVN, is responsible for severe obesity in our subject.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We suspect that her weight gain must involve occult food consumption, since measured energy expenditure was normal and was significantly greater than her reported caloric intake.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	124	 We hypothesize that SIM1 haploinsufficiency causes her phenotype.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	125	 If this hypothesis is correct, obesity due to SIM1 mutations would be expected to show autosomal dominant inheritance.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We cannot test this prediction in our kindred, since the translocation occurred de novo.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We did not find any additional SIM1 mutations by SSCP in 45 other children with marked obesity, but such mutations may be identified by screening larger numbers of subjects with more sensitive techniques.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	129	2 and the availability of SIM1 genomic sequences should facilitate testing for associations between obesity and the SIM1 gene.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	130	We cannot exclude the possibility that one or both of the SIM1 gene fragments are expressed as part of a fusion gene, although we did not identify any other transcription units in close proximity to the breakpoints.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	131	 It is also possible that a truncated SIM1 transcript produces a dominant-negative protein.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The reported interstitial 6q deletions associated with early-onset obesity are consistent with our haploinsufficiency model.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Screening additional patients with early-onset obesity might reveal additional microscopic or submicroscopic deletions of SIM1.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	134	Position effects on expression of nearby genes could also account for the phenotype of our proband.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Inspection of the human transcript map revealed no other obvious candidate genes near either translocation breakpoint.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The leptin receptor gene (LEPR) maps to 1p31,  > 20 Mb from the 1p breakpoint, and this locus appeared to be intact by FISH (data not shown).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The only human obesity-related trait that has been genetically mapped near either breakpoint is a quantitative trait locus for 24 h respiratory quotient linked to D1S550 on 1p31 to p21 in a study of Pima Indians (22).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	138	 However, this locus is unlikely to be relevant to our subject s phenotype, since her 24 h respiratory quotient was normal.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	139	It is also possible that the phenotype of our proband and her translocation are coincidental.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Indeed, her father and brother, who do not carry the translocation, are large.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	141	 However, unlike the proband, the father s obesity developed during adulthood, and the brother s growth was not sufficiently abnormal to bring him to medical attention.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Nevertheless, as with any complex trait, genetic background and environmental factors undoubtedly contribute to the severity of the phenotype.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	143	SIM1 is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila transcription factor Single-minded, a prototypical member of the bHLH-PAS (basic helix to loop to helix + period, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Single-minded) family of proteins.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Both homologs are also present in humans, and the predicted mouse and human SIM1 proteins show 96% amino acid identity (25).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	147	Dimerization of bHLH-PAS proteins with other bHLH-PAS proteins such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator is necessary for their function (26).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Specificity of dimerization is mediated at least in part through the PAS domains (27).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The translocation in SW116 separates the promoter and bHLH-encoding exon 1 of SIM1 from the downstream portion of the gene encoding the PAS and transcriptional regulatory domains, and probably represents a loss-of-function mutation.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The PVN produces corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), whereas both the PVN and SON produce oxytocin and arginine vasopressin (AVP).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The aPV produces somatostatin, which also impinges on the pituitary.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	158	Targeted inactivation of Sim1 confirmed its critical role in the development of neuroendocrine lineages in the hypothalamus (29).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In mice lacking SIM1, these nuclei are hypocellular and lack at least five types of secretory neuron (identified by the expression of oxytocin, vasopressin, TRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone and somatostatin) due to failure of terminal neuronal differentiation.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These animals die shortly after birth, presumably due to multiple hypothalamic to pituitary axis (HPA) deficits.

0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Detailed studies of Sim1 heterozygous mice are in progress.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	165	Sim1 continues to be expressed in the PVN in adult mice (unpublished data), suggesting that SIM1 participates in post-developmental HPA function(s).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	166	 These functions are presently obscure, since SIM1 s transcriptional targets are not known.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Expression of Sim1 in the PVN is intriguing with regard to obesity, since this nucleus is critical for the integration of signals governing appetite and energy expenditure (17).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Lesions in the rat PVN result in obesity, and microinjection into the PVN of virtually all known orexigenic neuro- transmitters or neuropeptides stimulates feeding.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Conversely, microinjection of anorexic peptides such as CRF or leptin attenuates post-fasting food intake.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	170	PVN neurons also express the MC4R (33), neuropeptide Y receptors Y1 (34) and Y5 (35), galanin and galanin receptors 1 and 2 (36), CRF and CRF receptor (37,38), and the orexin 2 (hypocretin) receptor (39).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This nucleus appears to be an important mediator of these anorexigenic and orexigenic signals (17).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Mutations in the MC4R gene have been shown to cause obesity and increased linear growth in both mice and humans (14,15).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The increased linear growth phenotype is not a general feature of monogenic obesity, since leptin deficiency does not increase linear growth in humans (40) and in fact impairs linear growth in mice.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In this regard, our proband s tall stature and the coincident expression of SIM1 and MC4R in the PVN suggest that both genes may belong to the same physiological or even molecular pathway regulating growth and energy balance.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Alternatively, our proband s stature may reflect increased growth velocity without change in final height, as has been noted in other obese children and ascribed to increased insulin levels (41).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	176	Previous genetic and pharmacological studies have identified a number of signaling molecules important for hypothalamic regulation of energy balance (17), but few studies have examined nuclear transcription.
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The transcription factor Fos is induced rapidly in response to cytokine-related signals, and this induction has been used to map leptin-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus (42).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Mice lacking another transcription factor expressed in the hypothalamus, nHLH2, show adult-onset obesity, possibly through a quantitative defect in POMC levels in the arcuate nucleus (43).
0.105649576.10587584.html.plaintext.txt	179	 It seems likely that changes in hypothalamic gene expression mediated by transcription factors such as nHLH2 or SIM1 play a role in the long-term regulation of food intake and energy expenditure.

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, this same dose of naloxone had no effect on i3vt MCH (5  microg/rat)-induced hyperphagia.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Because the opioid system has also been linked to food selection, we investigated whether MCH or orexin-A alters food choice when rats have simultaneous access to two diets differing in the relative amounts of fat and carbohydrate.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Whereas i3vt MCH stimulated intake of both diets and did not alter food choice, i3vt orexin-A stimulated intake of only the high fat diet.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These data indicate that despite several similarities between MCH and orexin-A, these two lateral hypothalamic area peptides stimulate food intake by recruiting different neural circuits and exert different effects on food choice.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	13	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   IN MAMMALS, neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) are important controllers of both feeding and behavioral arousal.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Animals with lesions of the LHA exhibit hypophagia, increased metabolic rate, decreased arousal, and extreme weight loss (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	15	 They also fail to respond with appropriate adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to homeostatic challenges such as fasting (6).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Because electrical stimulation of the LHA results in a vigorous feeding response as well (see review in Ref.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	17	 2), the LHA was historically regarded as the hypothalamic feeding center and was considered to be an important integrating site for the somatic and autonomic controls over ingestion.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Related to these functional observations, the LHA has extensive anatomical projections within the hypothalamus as well as throughout the entire neuroaxis, facilitating its coordination of metabolic, motivational, motor, autonomic, and arousal processes important in energy homeostasis (6).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	19	Neurons in the LHA synthesize peptidergic transmitters that stimulate feeding behavior, specifically melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) (7) and the orexins (A and B), which are also termed hypocretins (8, 9).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	20	 MCH is expressed predominately in the LHA (10, 11), and several lines of investigation implicate it as a key regulator of food intake and body weight (7, 12, 13, 14).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	21	 First, MCH gene expression is influenced by changes in energy balance.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The adipocyte hormone leptin inhibits MCH gene expression, and food restriction increases MCH gene expression (15).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Second, intracerebroventricular administration of exogenous MCH stimulates food intake (7, 13, 14), and mice that overexpress MCH are obese and insulin resistant (13).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Finally, mice with targeted disruption of the MCH gene have reduced food intake and body weight accompanied by increased metabolic rate, resulting in little or no body fat (15).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	25	The orexin or hypocretin system (8, 9) is comprised of two peptides, termed orexin-A and orexin-B, and two associated receptors.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Intraventricular administration of a neutralizing antiorexin antibody suppresses spontaneous feeding in fasted rats (16), and intraventricular administration of orexin-A dose-dependently stimulates food consumption (9, 16, 17, 18).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Changes in feeding after the administration of orexin-B have been inconsistent (9, 17, 18), such that a stronger case can be made for a role of orexin-A in energy homeostasis.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although orexin- and MCH-expressing neurons are made within different neurons in the LHA (19, 20), both peptides increase energy intake.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In this regard they are similar to agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptides made in the same population of neurons within the arcuate nucleus.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Both NPY and AgRP, when administered exogenously, increase food intake (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	31	 As axons from the LHA project to the medial hypothalamus, including the arcuate, and as the AgRP/NPY neurons in the arcuate project to the LHA (27, 28, 29), understanding the functional interactions among these peptides is important.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	32	 NPY- and AgRP-induced increases in food intake are dependent on opioid receptor activation, as this action is blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (30, 31).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Activation of the opioid system, in turn, has been associated with increased intake of preferred, high fat-containing diets (32).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Consistent with this, we found that AgRP selectively increases the intake of a high fat diet when rats have simultaneous access to two diets differing in their relative amounts of carbohydrate and fat (31).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	35	 On the other hand, administration of NPY reportedly increases the consumption of high carbohydrate diets (33, 34), although this has been attributed to a stimulation of whichever diet an individual rat prefers (35, 36).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether the orexigenic action of MCH and orexin-A depends upon activity at opioid receptors, and whether these peptides influence diet selection.

0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	127	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The current results indicate that although a subthreshold dose of naloxone, a nonselective opioid antagonist, can attenuate the potent effects of AgRP and orexin-A to increase food intake, the same dose does not alter the effect of MCH to stimulate food intake.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	128	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the orexigenic effect of orexin-A critically depends on activation of opioid receptors downstream of its receptor, whereas the orexigenic action of MCH does not.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The data also indicate that although both orexin-A and MCH can increase food intake, their effects on food choice are quite distinct.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although orexin-A selectively stimulates consumption of a HF diet, MCH stimulates intake of each diet comparably.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Thus MCH increases caloric intake without altering the source of those calories, whereas orexin-A alters both caloric intake and diet selection.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	132	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that with regard to energy homeostasis, AgRP and orexin-A share a common underlying mechanism, whereas MCH acts through a different mechanism.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The opioid system has long been implicated in the regulation of food intake, with increased opioid activity in the brain leading to increased caloric consumption (30, 39, 40, 41).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In particular, opioids modulate the incentive value of food, with opioid agonists increasing and opioid antagonists decreasing it (30, 40, 42).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Consistent with this, opioids alter the relative selection of, or preference for, specific foods.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	136	 ss-Endorphin, for example, increases intake of a preferred HF diet (43, 44).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Likewise, in the present experiments orexin-A selectively increased consumption of a preferred HF diet, and orexin-A-stimulated intake of pelleted chow was attenuated by the prior administration of naloxone.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Hence, we conclude that orexin-A, like AgRP, uses opioid-mediated circuits for its orexigenic action.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In contrast, a comparably orexigenic dose of MCH did not alter diet selection, and an MCH-elicited increase in pelleted chow was not influenced by naloxone.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We therefore conclude that the opioid system is not a downstream mediator of MCH s orexigenic action.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	141	Considerable controversy surrounds the contention that macronutrient intake is selectively regulated by different central nervous system systems (45), including the opioids (42, 46, 47).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	142	 As an example, when a drug or other treatment is given, it cannot easily be ascertained whether an increase (or decrease) in one particular food choice relative to another reflects a preference (aversion) for a specific macronutrient (e.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	143	 carbohydrate) or whether it reflects a magnified (minimized) preexisting preference based upon palatability (48).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Regardless of the actual mechanism, the critical observation is that orexin-A and MCH influence food intake via distinct mechanisms that can be dissociated by use of opioid antagonists and/or by considering food selection.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Because AgRP s orexigenic action is also reduced by naloxone, and because AgRP selectively increases intake of the preferred HF diet (31), we conclude that orexin-A and AgRP act through a common mechanism.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Recent data from our laboratory (49, 50) and others (51) indicate that an orexigenic dose of AgRP increases Fos activity in the LHA, and dual label immunohistochemistry indicates that the increased activity is in orexin-A-producing neurons.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Importantly, AgRP does not increase Fos activity in MCH-producing neurons (50, 51).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Hence, functional anatomical data are consistent with the pharmacological and behavioral data.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	149	AgRP is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors (27), and these are found in the LHA as well as other projection sites of the NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus (20, 29).
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The present data do not allow determination of whether AgRP stimulates orexin-A neurons, and these, in turn, stimulate food intake by acting via opioid receptors.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Additionally, these data do not determine whether the pathway is orexin-A to AgRP to opioid circuits, or whether other relay sites are involved that integrate information from both AgRP and orexin-A inputs.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Added to this are the facts that AgRP neurons in the arcuate cosynthesize NPY, and NPY-elicited food intake is also naloxone dependent.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Hence, NPY, AgRP, and orexin-A all appear to share a common circuit at some point.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	154	Over the last several years, the number of identified peptides that are involved in the control of food intake and energy balance has grown enormously.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Much of this growth has been fueled by the application of sophisticated molecular biological approaches and the pressing clinical need to treat the exponential growth in obesity.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	156	 To develop appropriate therapeutic strategies, however, this "alphabet soup" of peptides and transmitters will need to be organized into functional circuits.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The identification of such functional circuits will depend on intensive efforts to delineate both the neuroanatomical relationship among these systems as well as their functional interactions.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The present results demonstrate that two peptides located within a single hypothalamic subarea, peptides that appear to be regulated similarly by energy balance and that each stimulate food intake, act via distinct behavioral and neural mechanisms.
0.08808324.12130565.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Such results point to the complexity of a homeostatic system that was designed to do much more than regulate the intake of a rat with ad libitum access to a single caloric source.

0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	4	 REFERENCES   Mouse genetic models have played an important role in the elucidation of molecular pathways underlying human disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This approach is becoming an increasingly popular way to study the genetic underpinning of psychiatric disorders.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Genes within candidate regions for susceptibility to psychiatric illness can be evaluated through the phenotypic assessment of mutants mapped to the corresponding regions in the mouse genome.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Alternatively, one can search for mouse mutants displaying characteristics that might correspond to physiological and behavioral markers of a psychiatric disorder, sometimes referred to as endophenotypes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Mice with anomalies in these traits can be generated by targeted mutagenesis in known genes (gene-based mutagenesis or reverse genetics), or can be identified among progeny of mice in a random mutagenesis screen (phenotype-based mutagenesis or forward genetics).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this review, we discuss recently generated behavioral mutants in the mouse.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We also give an overview of several robust and commonly used behavioral phenotypes, their relevance to human disease and lessons learned from recent successes in mouse behavioral genetics.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	11	   MOUSE MODELS FOR HUMAN BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS TOP ABSTRACT MOUSE MODELS FOR HUMAN.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	12	 REFERENCES   The burgeoning interest in the genetics of complex traits, including behavior, has generated a variety of new approaches for uncovering the genetic basis of neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (1).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Recent efforts to localize susceptibility genes through linkage strategies, including genome-wide searches, have provided evidence for possible linkage of schizophrenia to chromosome regions 6p24, 8p, 13q32, 18p11.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	14	2 and 22q11 (2 to 7), and for confirmed susceptibility loci for bipolar disorder on chromosomes 4p16, 18p11.

0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The observed overlap of susceptibility loci for both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia on several chromosomes (e.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	17	2, 22q11) represents an intriguing finding considering the overlap in diagnosis of schizoaffective disorders and recurrent unipolar illness in relatives of individuals with either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (16 to 18).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	18	Despite these successes in genomic localization of susceptibility loci for several common psychiatric illnesses, genome scans generally do not have the power of assigning disease susceptibility loci to narrow  critical  regions, implying that the analysis of candidate genes will be a critical step in the identification of genes underlying the syndrome.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Promising candidate genes and corresponding proteins are routinely identified from their physiological and pharmacological properties and from functional studies of the gene in model organisms (Fig.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Genetic approaches currently available in the mouse make this model organism particularly powerful in the functional analysis of candidate genes and in defining molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of human disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For example, functional analysis of genes in the velocardiofacial syndrome region on 22q11, a region of shared susceptibility for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, involves behavioral studies of mice with mutations in genes within this region (19,20).

0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	24	  An alternative approach to identification of genes that may contribute to psychiatric illness involves genetic dissection of complex phenotypes into components, called endophenotypes, that may be more amenable to genetic studies than the fully expressed psychiatric manifestation of a disease (Fig.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For example, in schizophrenia, abnormalities in social interaction, attention, sensorimotor gating and olfactory and cognitive dysfunction have been suggested as useful endophenotypes (21 to 25).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These neurobiological or physiological characteristics of an apparently polygenic illness may occur as the result of single gene effects and might be useful as additional and perhaps more easily measured and robust phenotypes in genetic linkage analysis (26 to 28).

0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	28	 An example of the use of the mouse as a model in the endophenotype approach to identify genes underlying a psychiatric disorder, in this case, schizophrenia.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	29	  In this review, we suggest that these same physiological and neurobiological endophenotypes can be monitored or measured in an animal model organism.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We also review and discuss current efforts to identify single gene mutations in the mouse which alter these traits.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Genetic mapping of these mutant loci and predictions of their map location in the human genome based on syntenic regions in the mouse, may provide candidate genes for susceptibility loci in human disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Even in cases where this is not so, these single gene mutations may still be valuable in providing an entry point into important genetic pathways underlying human physiology and behavior.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In the field of obesity research, this point can be illustrated with the example of single gene mutations in the leptin and leptin receptor genes that cause obesity in the mouse (29 to 31).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Although genome scans in human families segregating obesity did not identify these loci as having a major effect in the majority of families (32 to 36), the studies in mice provided important information about the basic physiology and regulation of body weight in both humans and rodents (37,38).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	35	A number of strategies are currently being employed to generate or identify single-gene behavioral mutants in the mouse.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	36	 A collection of mice with targeted null-mutations in known genes are increasingly used as tools for defining the in vivo function of molecules.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These targeted null-mutations continue to provide a rich source of behavioral phenotypes (Table 1).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In addition, the recent employment of sophisticated tools for the generation of conditional mutants exhibiting gene loss in a temporally and spatially restricted manner, is proving particularly useful in the understanding of behavior (39,40).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In general, phenotypic changes in conditional mutants are more specific and subtle than in loss-of-function mutations of the same gene and, therefore, allow better understanding of underlying behavioral, neuropathological or physiological consequences.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Conditional mutations also allow for more appropriate controls to dissect components of behavior such as acquisition, consolidation, retention and performance in studies of learning and memory (41,42).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the case of genes that play a role in both development and behavior, conditional and induced mutations permit studies of behavior apart from the role that the disrupted gene plays during the course of pre- or postnatal development.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	42	 For example, later in this review we describe specific behavioral and electrophysiological defects in a conditional knockout for the neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkB (43), whereas complete loss of function of this gene is associated with postnatal lethality, most likely due to respiratory failure (44).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Targeted mutants displaying behavioral phenotypes: a subset of those reported since 1998   In contrast to gene-based approaches, also called reverse genetics, forward genetics in an animal model begins with the phenotype.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	44	 There are two approaches commonly used in forward genetics, identification of an altered phenotype due to point mutations induced by a mutagen, such as N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) or observation of natural phenotypic variation in a genetic cross between two inbred strains to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) (45).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The intended outcome of both is the identification and positional cloning of the altered or influential gene.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The QTL approach represents a powerful tool in behavioral genetics and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (46,47).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	47	To increase the resources necessary for forward genetics strategies and to generate single-gene mutants displaying behavioral anomalies, several phenotype-based mutagenesis programs have been initiated.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	48	 (48), in this issue, and Justice et al.

0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, we provide an overview of critical issues in the identification of mouse models of psychiatric disorders, such as the definition of relevant phenotypes and the problems involved in characterization of novel behavioral mutants identified in random mutagenesis screens.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	51	    GOOD GENETICS NEEDS GOOD PHENOTYPES  (26) TOP ABSTRACT MOUSE MODELS FOR HUMAN.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	52	 REFERENCES   The first priority in the search for behavioral mutants in the mouse is the identification and definition of phenotypes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	53	 A subset of the impressive collection of targeted mutants with behavioral phenotypes that have been reported in the last 2 years is listed in Table 1.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	54	 A limitation of these studies has been the inability to directly compare these mutants and to correlate studies performed in different laboratories, primarily due to differences in experimental procedures and behavioral paradigms or the differing genetic backgrounds of these novel mutations.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	55	 These concerns were recently confirmed by the observation that differing behavioral profiles have been observed in different laboratories, using the same inbred and mutant lines of mice and even after strictly controlling both environmental variables and experimental procedures (50).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Although this finding was discouraging, the study by Crabbe et al.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	57	 also had promising results in that the genetic variance was relatively high for all of the behaviors tested and large differences between strains were shown to be robust and unlikely to be influenced by specific laboratory environments (50).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	58	Rather than providing a reason not to perform behavioral analysis, the study by Crabbe et al.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	59	 provides guidelines regarding the variables that need to be addressed when doing behavior studies of any kind (50).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For example, to address the problem of replication and uniformity of behavioral phenotyping, the analysis of novel behavioral mutants should be performed using a standard battery of tests which provide strong and consistent phenotypes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It has also been recommended that behavioral differences observed in mutant animals should be replicated in multiple laboratories and using multiple tests of a behavioral domain (50).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This, of course, implies that behavioral mutants should be shared among investigators in the interest of confirming altered behaviors observed in their own laboratories.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In addition, we suggest that behavioral assessment of one or two inbred strains (for example, C57BL/6 and DBA/2) should also be conducted along with wild-type littermates to provide a  running baseline  by which to compare results at any given timepoint (51).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This information will allow the calibration of behavioral or physiological parameters in novel mutations with those in the existing and generally available inbred strains, as well as provide a better basis for comparison of findings and experimental conditions from one laboratory to other.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Finally, considerable thought should be given to controlling the genetic background on which the mutation is generated and maintained (52,53).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	66	A major challenge in the analysis of rodent phenotypes is identification of those traits that correspond to endophenotypes in human disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Based on recent studies, a number of relatively simple and robust behaviors have been selected as amenable to forward genetic approaches.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	68	Sensorimotor gating Deficiencies in attention and information processing have long been noted in patients with schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses (54,55).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	69	 It is believed that the inability to filter out extraneous stimuli and process information that is presented in fairly rapid succession accounts for the tendency of schizophrenics to suffer from fragmentation of normal cognitive processes (56) and that these functions are vital to the maintenance of cognitive function (57).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Some of these attentional deficiencies may be due to impairments in sensory gating (58).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Sensory gating can be measured by the level of attenuation of a startle response (either acoustic or tactile) upon presentation of a non-startle-inducing prepulse stimulus (commonly called prepulse inhibition).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	72	Prepulse inhibition of startle response (PPI) is one of the most easily transferred behavioral tests between humans and mice.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In humans, the startle response can be measured as an eyeblink response or P50 event related potential suppression whereas in mice, it is generally measured as a whole-body response using commercially available startle chambers.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Multiple studies have been conducted using inbred strains of mice to show that there is substantial genetic influence on both the startle response and PPI.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In general, inbred strains vary in their response to both acoustic and tactile startle stimuli and display a wide range of variability in prepulse inhibition (51,59,60).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	76	Several single-gene mutations show alterations in prepulse inhibition (Table 1).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	77	 One example, in particular, shows the power of animal models to investigate possible candidate genes in human disorders.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Prodh to / to  mice, deficient for the gene that encodes proline dehydrogenase, show significantly lower levels of PPI in comparison with wild-type controls along with elevated levels of proline in the brain (20).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Prodh is the mouse homolog of the Drosophila slgA (sluggish-A) gene.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The human homolog lies on chromosome 22q11 in a region that has been associated with psychiatric illness and is, in some cases, deleted in psychiatric patients (61 to 63).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In addition, elevated levels of proline have been reported in a patient with the 22q11 deletion (64).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	82	Mice deficient for the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-180) also display decreased PPI as well as increased lateral ventricle size (65).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	83	 NCAM is involved in neural migration and a previous study has shown that it is markedly reduced in the hippocampus of schizophrenic brains (66).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This study is particularly important because it lends evidence to the widely held belief that schizophrenia results from abnormalities in brain development (67,68).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	85	Learning and memory The use of rodent models to study the genetics of learning and memory began in the 1940s with the selective breeding of maze-dull and maze-bright rats (69).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	86	 For several decades, much of the work in the genetic analysis of learning and memory consisted of basic behavior- or quantitative-genetic analysis using experimental models such as Drosophila and Phormia regina, the blowfly.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, the use of Mendelian crosses to perform genetic analysis was limited, only providing information about the genetic architecture of learning and memory and revealing that, in most cases, the genetics are complex and attributable to many genes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In the late 1960s, Seymour Benzer proposed the forward genetic approach of using chemical mutagens to disrupt single genes and screening lines of mutagenized flies to observe abnormal behaviors (70).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Using this method, a multitude of genes for learning and memory have been identified in Drosophila (71).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	90	There are several commonly used tasks to study learning and memory in mice.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The hidden platform version of the Morris water maze is a test for spatial learning in which animals are trained to escape from a pool of water (72).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Mice are given multiple training sessions to learn the placement of the platform using visual cues in the room.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The platform is then removed and the search pattern of the animal is recorded.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Animals that have learned the location of the platform will spend more time in the area that had previously contained the platform and will make more crosses over the platform site.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Different configurations of the water maze measure different forms of learning and utilize different brain systems.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A second commonly used paradigm for studying learning and memory is the conditioned fear test.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The direct measure of freezing behavior in response to discrete conditioned stimuli such as tones or lights as a measure of learning was first conducted by Bouton and Bolles (73).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Fear conditioning can evaluate two discrete forms of learning, cued and contextual, and there is evidence that different neural substrates support these two forms of learning (74).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	99	Genetic manipulations, including gene targeting, are being utilized extensively to test the role of genes in learning and memory (Table 1) (41,42).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	100	 These studies were initiated with genes or proteins shown previously by pharmacological studies to be involved in synaptic plasticity.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	101	 For example, null mutations in the calcium calmodulin kinase II (75,76), CREB (77,78), PKC (79,80), NMDA receptor 1 subunit (81), adenylate cyclase (82,83) and mGluR5 (84) revealed anomalies in different forms of synaptic plasticity and in learning and memory.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The relationship between long-term potentiation (LTP) and behavioral affects on learning and memory are particularly intriguing in recently generated hypermorphic and conditional mutants.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	103	 For example, it was reported that mice overexpressing the NMDA receptor 2B (Grin2b) in the forebrain show enhanced learning and memory in a variety of behavioral tasks including the Morris water maze, conditioned fear, novel-object recognition and fear extinction and also exhibit enhanced LTP, thought to underlie some forms of learning and memory (85).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Deficits in learning and memory are apparent in conditional knockouts for the neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) (43).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Trkb conditional knockout mice (the knockout is restricted to the forebrain and occurs only during postnatal development) do not learn the Morris water maze, perform poorly in the radial maze task and show reduced LTP in the hippocampus (43).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Despite these recent examples linking LTP and learning, there is also growing evidence of dissociation between the two (86 to 88).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In a more recent example, mutant mice lacking the L--amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor subunit GluR-A (GluR-A to / to ) showed an absence of LTP in the hippocampus, but exhibited no deficits in spatial learning (89).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	108	A significant outcome of studies described above is that many of the same biochemical components and common molecular mechanisms underlie learning and memory in invertebrate and vertebrate systems (for a review see ref.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Systematic assessment of learning and memory in targeted mutations, as well as in mutants from random mutagenesis screens, will reveal differences between these pathways, and facilitate identification of genetic components that are specific for a mammalian system, including factors that are involved in human disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	110	Anxiety The manifestation of anxiety in a number of psychiatric disorders, including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific and social phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of its genetic etiology.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	111	The use of animal models to study anxiety-related behaviors has a long history (90,91).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The most commonly used assay for testing anxiety in both rats and mice has historically been the brightly lit open field (90).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Other assays have also been developed and are now widely used, including the elevated plus maze (92,93) or zero maze (94).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Both tests take advantage of the fact that rodents are fearful of bright and/or open spaces yet also have a tendency to explore novel environments.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	115	 All of the tests allow measurement of a variety of  anxious  or  non-anxious  behaviors including time spent in closed or dark areas versus open or lighted areas, wall-seeking tendency (thigmotaxis), defecation and exploratory activity.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The hallmark of a relevant animal assay for anxiety is, of course, the ability of either anxiolytics or anxiogenics to reverse an animal s behavior on the test and many of the paradigms listed above were developed to study the efficacy of various anxiolytic drugs.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The validation of relating rodent anxiety to human anxiety has been proven numerous times using these behaviors (95 to 97).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	118	There are numerous examples of mice with null mutations in a variety of genes which express abnormal behavior in several different assays for anxiety (Table 1).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Some of the more notable examples include the serotonin gene knockouts, Htr1a and Htr1b, that have been tested by multiple groups and have consistently shown elevated (Htr1a) or reduced (Htr1b) anxiety (98 to 103).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In addition, three different studies have investigated anxiety-related behaviors in knockouts for the corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crhr1) gene (104 to 106) and all three studies showed reduced anxiety in the null mutants.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The consensus in behaviors observed between the different laboratories in both the serotonin and Crhr knockouts validates the conclusion by Crabbe et al.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	122	 (50) that differences seen in genetically engineered mice cannot stand on their own until they are replicated and validated in different behavioral paradigms and across different laboratories.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	123	Sleep and circadian rhythms Deficits in sleep and circadian rhythms are part of the symptomatology of a variety of psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder and depression.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The earliest understanding of the genetic nature of circadian rhythms came from the identification of circadian mutations in Drosophila (period) (107) and Neurospora (frequency) (108).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Genetic studies identified additional genes in the circadian system and their gene interactions provide one of the best characterized and evolutionarily conserved molecular genetic pathways underlying behavior (for a review see ref.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	126	Single-gene mutations in the mouse have played an important role in the dissection of the circadian pathway.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Several years ago, the identification of the Clock gene, starting with an ENU-induced mutation, provided the first transcription factor in the circadian feedback loop (110,111).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Recently, null mutations for other components of the clock have been generated.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Mutants lacking the Period2 gene (mPer2), one among three known homologs of the Drosophila period (per) gene, display a shorter circadian period and loss of circadian rhythmicity in total darkness (112).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana identified cryptochromes, blue light receptors (113).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Targeted null mutations for the mouse homologs (Cry1 and Cry2) showed that these genes are essential for the maintenance of circadian rhythmicity rather than entrainment to light cues (114 to 116).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Cryptochrome 1 knockouts (Cry1 to / to ) have a shortened circadian period of ~1 h (114,116) while Cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) knockouts have a lengthened circadian period of ~1 h (114,115).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In total darkness, double knockouts of Cry1 and Cry2 (Cry1 to / to /Cry2 to / to ) display complete arrythmicity, indicating that they no longer have any internal circadian clock, and that the two genes have partially overlapping function (114,116).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	134	A fascinating finding in the field of genetics of sleep was reported last year when it was discovered that a null mutation in the orexin (also known as hypocretin, Hcrt) gene resulted in narcolepsy-like behavior and changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern in mice (117).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Furthermore, it was also reported that modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug, activates orexin-containing neurons.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This finding, in conjunction with the behavioral and EEG observations, led the authors to conclude that these knockout mice are a model for human narcolepsy.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Another landmark discovery is the identification of the orexin receptor 2 as the gene disrupted in the dog model of narcolepsy (118).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In general, these studies represent a powerful example of the marriage of reverse and forward genetic approaches in the identification of components of an important neurobiological and physiological pathway.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	139	   IDENTIFICATION OF BEHAVIORAL MUTANTS IN PHENOTYPE-BASED MUTAGENESIS SCREENS TOP ABSTRACT MOUSE MODELS FOR HUMAN.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	140	 REFERENCES   Recently, a number of random and chromosomal region-specific mutagenesis programs have been initiated to take advantage of the power of single-gene mutations for developing an understanding of complex disorders.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Many of these efforts are focusing on a wide range of phenotypes including physiological assays and developmental phenotypes, as well as neurological and behavioral traits (49,119 to 121).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In this section we discuss insights into the nature of behavioral anomalies that can be drawn from studies of mice with targeted mutations in known genes, and consideration of these issues in designing a random mutagenesis screen.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	143	Ongoing mutagenesis efforts have already identified an array of novel mutants (http://www.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	144	html ), including those with behavioral phenotypes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Novel mutants with anomalies in circadian behavior, rest to activity patterns, sensorimotor gating, anxiety and learning and memory have been reported and phenotypic characterization and genetic mapping of these mutations is in progress (as reported at the 13th International Mouse Genome Conference in Philadelphia, PA, and the Mouse Molecular Genetics meeting in Heidelberg, Germany).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Characterization of these mutations may take a course that will differ from characterization of mutations with visible phenotypes or more obvious neurological symptoms.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Some caution, persistence and patience will be necessary in the search for mutations based exclusively on abnormal behavioral phenotypes, as well as in identification of the genes defined by these loci.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In general, reduced penetrance, variable expressivity and sensitivity to genetic background, as well as the influences of environmental factors, hamper the characterization of mutants identified in random mutagenesis screens.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The Clock mutation represents the only published behavioral mutation identified in a random mutagenesis screen.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Future studies will show how many behavioral mutants will have as robust a phenotype as Clock.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	151	Although the identification and cloning of the Clock mutation illustrated the value and efficacy of a dominant screen, it is important to broaden and extend screens to those that have the potential of uncovering recessive mutations.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	152	 With a dominant screen, a large number of genes may be missed.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	153	 For example, among targeted behavioral mutants, only a small number of lines show dominant or semidominant phenotypes (43,122).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Future studies will show whether this can be attributed to the fact that the majority of genes do not have abnormal phenotypes when present in one copy, or whether mutations with dominant behavioral phenotypes are indeed rare.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Sophisticated electrophysiological, neuropathological or neurobiochemical assessments of novel mutations may uncover subtle anomalies in heterozygotes that would be missed by routine behavioral observation.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This point can be illustrated with the recently reported Trkb conditional knockouts (43).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Whereas in homozygotes, impaired LTP of hippocampal synapses is accompanied by impaired learning, in heterozygotes, a partial reduction of LTP can be detected, but no apparent behavioral anomalies have been observed in currently utilized learning and memory tasks.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This suggests that the presence or absence of a dominant phenotype is not an absolute finding and may depend on how hard one looks for this phenotype.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	159	Another important question that remains is how many dominant behavioral mutations will be associated with developmental or visible anomalies in homozygotes or, conversely, how many embryonic lethal mutations will have dominant behavioral phenotypes.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	160	 From a human genetics standpoint this is an important question, because genes with a role in development could also be considered as candidate genes for susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	161	 For example, mutations in Presenilin 1 (Pre1) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer s disease (123).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	162	 A targeted null-mutation in this gene in mice is associated with embryonic lethality due to defects in somite segmentation (124).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It will be interesting to examine the behavior or neuropathology of Pre1 to /+ heterozygotes or await behavioral analysis of mice with the spectrum of point mutations seen in human Alzheimer s disease.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	164	Over the last years, the field of targeted mutagenesis has provided several examples of mutations with strong phenotypes when combined with other mutations, although the single gene mutations did not exhibit any anomalies or, at the least, weak phenotypes (114,125,126).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These findings provide an important clue in the search for novel behavioral mutants using random mutagenesis.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Mutations with phenotypes that are weak or show incomplete penetrance may be tested in combination (double mutant analysis) with other available mutants.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Moreover, random mutagenesis screens for novel phenotypes in existing mutations generated by targeted mutagenesis (so called  sensitized screens ) may be particularly useful in the identification of genes in the same molecular or genetic pathway.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The use of sensitized screens for behavioral phenotypes that combine random mutagenesis with pharmacological manipulations may yield mutations that affect a defined neurochemical pathway.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	169	A mutagenesis screen currently being performed in our laboratory involves examination of G1 progeny of ENU treated mice in a battery of behavioral paradigms, such as the zero maze, rotarod, acoustic startle response, olfaction and analysis of wheel running activity patterns under light:dark and constant dark conditions (L.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This experimental paradigm allows us to evaluate, prior to testing inheritance, how specific or pleiotropic the behavioral anomalies are in identified phenotypic deviants.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Whereas mutants with specific phenotypes may be of particular value, combinations of phenotypes in single-gene mutations may be even more informative in the search for models of psychiatric disorders.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Epidemiological evidence indicates that comorbidity may be the rule rather than the exception in behavioral disorders in humans.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	173	 For example, the co-occurrence of anxiety disorders, substance abuse and recurrent unipolar disorder has been documented repeatedly (127,128).
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Therefore, single-gene mutants in the mouse, generated by either forward or reverse genetic experiments, should be examined for a variety of phenotypic traits.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Combinations of phenotypes which are found together in a human syndrome will be of particular importance.
0.27228677.10767319.html.plaintext.txt	176	The impending elucidation of the complete sequence of both the mouse and human genomes along with the ability to perform expression profiling of a large number of genes to compare mutant and wild-type animals, will increase the value of generated mutations, facilitate positional cloning of the mutant gene and aid in the understanding of the molecular pathways affected by these mutations.

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	3	Submitted 2 August 2004 ; accepted in final form 10 January 2005.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   Although starvation-induced biochemical and metabolic changes are perceived by the hypothalamus, the adrenal gland plays a key role in the integration of metabolic activity and energy balance, implicating feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Given that orexins are involved in regulating food intake and activating the HPA axis, we hypothesized that food deprivation, an acute challenge to the systems that regulate energy balance, should elicit changes in orexin receptor signaling at the hypothalamic and adrenal levels.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Food deprivation induced orexin type 1 (OX1R) and 2 (OX2R) receptors at mRNA and protein levels in the hypothalamus, in addition to a fivefold increase in prepro-orexin mRNA.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Cleaved peptides OR-A and OR-B are also elevated at the protein level.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Interestingly, adrenal OX1R and OX2R levels were significantly reduced in food-deprived animals, whereas there was no expression of prepro-orexin in the adrenal gland in either state.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Food deprivation exerted a differential effect on OXR-G protein coupling.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the hypothalamus of food deprived rats compared with controls, a significant increase in coupling of orexin receptors to Gq, Gs, and Go was demonstrated, whereas coupling to Gi was relatively less.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, in the adrenal cortex of the food-deprived animal, there was decreased coupling of orexin receptors to Gs, Go, and Gq and increased coupling to Gi.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Subsequent second-messenger studies (cAMP/IP3) have supported these findings.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Our data indicate that food deprivation has differential effects on orexin receptor expression and their signaling characteristics at the hypothalamic and adrenocortical levels.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These findings suggest orexins as potential metabolic regulators within the HPA axis both centrally and peripherally.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	15	STARVATION-INDUCED BIOCHEMICAL and metabolic changes are perceived by the hypothalamus, which in turn coordinates behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine responses to these stimuli (1).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Studies in rodents have shown that food deprivation induces marked ACTH and corticosterone responses, implicating feeding as a major synchronizer of rhythms in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (2, 3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Besides nutritional states and neuropeptides, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and neuropeptide Y (NPY), known to regulate both the HPA system and feeding behavior, several "signals" are known to regulate the HPA system.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Hypoglycemia is a potent activator of the HPA axis, reflecting the strong functional relationship between the hypothalamic feeding centers and the HPA axis (4), and leptin, whose concentrations are governed by nutritional status, has an inhibitory effect on plasma corticosterone in rats (5).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	19	More recently, orexin A (OR-A) and orexin B (OR-B), produced by neurons localized in the lateral and dorsal hypothalamic area and perifornical hypothalamus (6), have been implicated in the central regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis (7).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Both OR-A (a 33-residue peptide) and OR-B (a 28-residue peptide) are proteolytically cleaved from a common precursor, prepro-orexin, and share a 46% amino acid sequence homology.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Besides playing a role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis, orexins have been reported to exert divergent physiological actions (8 to 12).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Orexins orchestrate their actions by binding and activating two types of G protein-coupled receptors, orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptor (OX2R), which display 64% homology in their amino acid sequence (6).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The OX1R preferentially binds OR-A, whereas OX2R binds both OR-A and OR-B, apparently with similar affinity (6).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	24	In the hypothalamus, levels of prepro-orexin messenger RNA are regulated by several nutritional states and signals.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Fasting (6) and insulin-induced hypoglycemia (13, 14) increase prepro-orexin mRNA in the rat lateral hypothalamic area, whereas leptin has the converse effect (15).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interestingly, fasting and leptin also regulate the hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings, and the observation that intracerebroventricular administration of OR-A or OR-B stimulates food consumption in rats (6), suggests a physiological role for these neuropeptides as mediators in the regulation of feeding, particularly in response to energy deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although the hypothalamus is considered the cornerstone for maintenance of energy homeostasis, the adrenal gland plays a role in the integration of metabolic activity and energy balance.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	29	 For example, studies in food-deprived rats have suggested that the HPA axis is integral to a larger hypothalamic system that mediates energy flow (2) and that, in these animals, catabolic activity quickly predominates, reinforced by elevated corticosterone not driven by hypothalamic control (ACTH), implicating adrenal activity as a metabolic regulator (3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In addition to their hypothalamic effects, "nutritional signals" such as leptin and NPY have a direct action at the adrenal level, via their receptors, including the modulation of corticosteroid secretion (17, 18).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Of interest, rat adrenals express both orexin receptors (19), and orexins stimulate corticosterone secretion of rat adrenocortical cells through the activation of the adenylyl cyclase-dependent signaling cascade (20).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	32	The expression of orexin receptors in both rat and human adrenals is well documented.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In the rat, both receptors are expressed in the adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Interestingly, the highest amount of OX2R mRNA was found in the adrenal gland of male rats, which was four times higher than brain OX2R mRNA levels (19).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In situ hybridization revealed that OX2R mRNA is localized primarily in the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis, whereas there was no expression at the adrenal medulla (19).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	36	In view of these findings and the observation that changes in orexin levels are closely related to nutritional status rather than to the state of hunger or satiety (21), we hypothesizsed that activation of orexin receptors at the adrenal level may explain the ACTH-independent rise in corticosterone seen in "starved" rats.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We sought to investigate, in both the hypothalamus and adrenal gland, 1) whether levels of orexins and their receptors OX1R and OX2R differ in fed and food-deprived rats, by assessing their expression at mRNA and protein level and 2) to elucidate whether nutritional status elicits functional changes of OX1R and OX2R, by studying G protein coupling and the subsequent activation of second messenger pathways.

0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	271	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   In the present study, we demonstrate the effects of food deprivation (24 h) on orexins and orexin receptor expression in the rat hypothalamus and adrenal cortex at both mRNA and protein levels.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In addition, we present the differential effects of this "stressful" nutritional stimulus on the signaling characteristics of orexin receptors at these tissues.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	273	The hypothalamus plays a major role in the regulation of food intake and energy balance by integrating multiple anorexigenic and orexigenic signals, including those elicited by orexins (21, 27).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	274	 A similar role for the adrenal gland is possible given that it expresses receptors for leptin, NPY (28), and orexin (19, 29), all regulators of energy homeostasis.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In agreement with previous studies (6, 15), we were able to show that the levels of prepro-orexin mRNA are influenced by nutritional status, being upregulated upon fasting in the hypothalamus.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Detailed analysis at the protein level confirmed that both cleaved bioactive peptides (OR-A and OR-B) are upregulated under food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Previous studies in fasted lactating rats demonstrated hypothalamic OR-B levels to be raised 10-fold above those for controls (nonfasted), whereas OR-A showed no change (30).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	278	 These differences can be due to the rodent strain used, the sex, metabolic status, and the duration of food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	279	Food deprivation leads to changes in the activity of the HPA axis within 3 h, with an increase in corticosterone (3).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	280	 These findings are of interest given that orexins stimulate the HPA axis when administered centrally (31).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Furthermore, orexin neurons are sensitive to nutritional signals such as insulin and glucose, which alter with food deprivation (3), and hypothalamic orexin neurons express leptin receptors.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	282	 As with prepro-orexin expression, fasting and leptin also regulate hypothalamic expression of orexin receptors (15, 16, 32).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	283	Numerous studies have mapped in detail the expression of orexin and orexin receptors at the hypothalamic level.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	284	 (33) have demonstrated that, within the hypothalamus, OX1R mRNA is most abundant in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, whereas OX2R is predominantly expressed in the paraventricular nucleus.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In another study, it has been shown that, after 20 h of fasting, levels of rat OX1R mRNA were significantly increased in the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei and the medial division of amygdala, whereas levels of OX2R mRNA were augmented in the arcuate nucleus but remained unchanged in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and amygdala following fasting (16).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Three different studies (34, 13, 15) indicated that prepro-orexin is upregulated in the hypothalamus upon food deprivation in the lateral hypothalamic area of the rat.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In agreement with these studies, we noted that, on fasting, hypothalamic OX1R and OX2R gene expression was induced.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Given the detailed analysis these studies provided, we shifted our interest to the expression at the protein level.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Here, we provide new evidence that these changes are also mirrored at the protein level, as it was assessed by semiquantitative Western blotting analysis.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	290	Previous studies (3, 4) have shown that food deprivation switches feeding responses to adrenocortical responses and that the time of food presentation appears to be a more potent synchronizer of the phase of plasma corticosteroid levels than is the light-dark cycle (35).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	291	 These observations are of interest given that orexins have circadian-dependent actions and that orexins are known to increase corticosterone production in rats (20) and cortisol in human adrenocortical cells (36).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, in view of our data, we can conclude that adrenal orexin receptors do not influence or mediate the rise in corticosterone levels seen under food deprivation conditions.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	293	It is well documented that food deprivation induces multiple metabolic changes that may directly influence orexin receptor expression in the adrenal gland.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	294	 For example, there is a negative correlation between testosterone levels and fasting (37).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Studies from our laboratory have shown that testosterone levels also decrease following 24 h of food deprivation (unpublished observations).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Interestingly, in gonadectomized rats, there was a significant downregulation of adrenal OX2R, an effect that was reversed upon testosterone replacement (38).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Although the regulation of adrenal orexin receptors by gonadal steroids is not directly relevant to our findings, it suggests that changes in orexin receptor expression may be a secondary phenomenon following initial food deprivation-induced alterations.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	298	Future studies should concentrate on elucidating the central and peripheral actions of orexins.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	299	 This can be done by systematically deleting OX1R and/or OX2R in a tissue-specific fashion using the Cre-loxP system.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	300	 By use of this approach, a model can be generated bearing neuronal or adrenal-specific deletions of orexin receptors.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	301	Our data indicate that orexin signaling may be enhanced in response to energy deficit sensed by the hypothalamus, possibly and predominantly via OX1R, but at the same time decreased in the adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Orexins act through two distinct G protein-coupled receptors, which can transduce intracellular signals by activating heterotrimeric G proteins.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It is likely that multiple second messenger systems are involved, as orexins have been shown to increase intracellular calcium influx (6, 39, 40, 41).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	304	 There is also the suggestion that OX2R is coupled to the inhibitory Gi protein (42).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	305	 We have shown for the first time that native orexin receptors in the hypothalamus can activate four types of G proteins, namely Gs, Gq, Go, and Gi, in response to OR-A.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Although Gi and Go are the two major inhibitory signaling pathways in the rat brain, we have previously shown that multiple subtypes of G proteins couple to other G protein-coupled receptor systems (43).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Food deprivation altered the G protein coupling profile.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Our findings are supported by functional assays of cAMP and IP3 assays, reflecting their G protein coupling status.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Further research is needed to investigate whether the -subunits are implicated in activating second messengers and also to assess the effects of OR-B on G protein signaling.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	310	Although we have demonstrated functional orexin receptors in human fetal and adult adrenal glands (23, 44), this is the first report of G proteins coupling to orexin receptors in the rat adrenal cortex.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Interestingly, we note a downregulation of all G protein(s), apart from Gi, in response to OR-A upon food deprivation.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Second messenger studies confirmed these findings with minimal response toward cAMP production and none of IP3 in the adrenal cortex of the food-deprived rat.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Our findings support the observations that, in rat adrenocortical cells, OR-A stimulates corticosterone release via a cAMP pathway (20).
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	314	Despite demonstrating for first time that rat orexin receptors can couple differentially to several G protein -subunits and activate multiple second messengers, caution should be exercised as to how to interpret these changes.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Given the plethora of different cell types that reside within the hypothalamus and the adrenal gland, no distinctions can be made between specific subpopulations from brain regions or adrenal zones from our data.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Here, we provide evidence about the signaling characteristics of orexin receptors under food deprivation in total hypothalamic and adrenal preparations.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	317	In conclusion, our study indicates that nutritional changes like food deprivation can exert differential effects on orexin receptor expression and their signaling characteristics at the hypothalamic and adrenocortical levels.
0.18766233.15687100.html.plaintext.txt	318	 However, the significance of our novel findings, in particular the differential expression of G protein activation upon food deprivation, in both the hypothalamus and the adrenal cortex needs further elucidation.

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	5	To elucidate the exact role of the PGD2 system in sleep-wake regulation in vivo, the sleep behavior of knockout mice, generated in the author's and other laboratories, was examined for lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS), PGD receptor, adenosine A2A receptor, and histamine H1 receptor; transgenic mice overexpressing the human L-PGDS gene, generated in the author's laboratory, were also examined.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The circadian profiles of sleep patterns of wild-type and the genetically manipulated mice were essentially identical, indicating the possibility that the deficiency of one system may be effectively compensated by some other systems during development.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Available evidence indicated that the PGD2 system is involved in the homeostatic regulation of non-rapid eye movement sleep and that the arousal effect of orexin A is mediated by the histamine H1 receptor system.

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	12	DURING THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, molecular genetic approaches have become an increasingly popular and powerful tool in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-wake regulation.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The fruits of these investigations have been the subject of extensive reviews in recent years.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For example, in a special issue of the Journal of Sleep Research entitled "Genetic approaches to Sleep and Sleep Disorders", 10 contributors presented state-of-the-art reviews up to mid-1999 (36).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	15	 A symposium entitled "Genetics of Sleep" was held at the Third International Congress of World Federation of Sleep Research Societies in Dresden in October 1999 (38).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Because the orexin/hypocretin system was suggested as having a role in the cause of narcolepsy, this subject has also been reviewed in depth (19).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In the present article, therefore, focus is placed mainly on the ongoing and recent experimental studies in my laboratory related to the molecular genetics of sleep and wakefulness, with special emphasis on the PGD2 and related systems.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In addition, the possible involvement of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, another lipid mediator in the brain function, in rapid eye movement (REM), but not non-rapid eye movement (NREM), sleep has been studied with phospholipase C (PLC)-4 knockout (KO) mice (17).

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	21	 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	22	PGD2 has been implicated as a physiological regulator of sleep because PGD2 is the major prostanoid in the mammalian brain and the intracerobroventricular infusion of femtomolar amounts per minute of PGD2 induced both NREM and REM sleep in rats, mice, and monkeys.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Sleep promoted by PGD2 was indistinguishable from natural sleep as judged by several electrophysiological and behavioral criteria, whereas sleep induced by hypnotic drugs manifested itself differently from natural or PGD2-induced sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	24	Lipocalin-type PGD synthase (L-PGDS), the enzyme that produces PGD2 from PGH2 in the brain, is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of ~26,000.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The enzyme has been purified from the brains of rats, frogs, and humans, and its crystal structure, as well as catalytic properties, was determined.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	26	 When selenium chloride, a potent, specific, and reversible inhibitor of L-PGDS was infused into the third ventricle of a rat during daylight hour, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were inhibited time and dose dependently.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	27	 After ~2 h from the start of the infusion, both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep were almost completely but reversibly inhibited, indicating that L-PGDS plays a crucial role in sleep regulation.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These earlier studies up to 1999 have been reviewed previously (10-13, 37).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	29	Whereas our studies were mainly carried out with rats and monkeys, Roberts and co-workers (28) reported in 1980 that the endogenous production of PGD2 increased up to 150-fold in patients with systemic mastocytosis during deep sleep episodes.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Subsequently, the PGD2 concentration was shown to be elevated progressively and selectively up to 1,000-fold in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with African sleeping sickness (25).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These clinical observations are consistent with the concept that excessive endogenous production of PGD2 is responsible for sleep also in humans under certain pathological conditions.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, experiments to verify this assumption have not yet been carried out in animals.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	33	To examine how the L-PGDS gene and endogenously produced PGD2 function in vivo, we generated transgenic (TG) mice by incorporating the human L-PGDS gene into mice (26).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Northern blot analyses clearly revealed that human L-PGDS mRNA was overexpressed in almost all tissues, including the brain of these TG mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The TG mice were therefore expected to sleep most of the time.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, contrary to expectations, the animals appeared to be quite healthy and to grow and to sleep normally.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In fact, there was no significant difference in the overall sleep pattern between the wild-type (WT) and TG mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, when the tails of the mice were clipped for DNA sampling at 8:00 PM, the amount of NREM sleep, but not that of REM sleep, of the TG mice increased sharply and significantly.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This effect seemed to last for several hours, after which the amount of NREM sleep returned to the control level after 5-6 h.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The maximum increment was almost as high as the maximum amount of sleep during the daytime.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, the sleep pattern of the WT mice was essentially unaffected by the tail clipping.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These somewhat unexpected results may be explained by assuming that L-PGDS is not a rate-limiting enzyme in the arachidonic cascade system and that the rate-limiting enzyme located upstream of the L-PGDS-catalyzed step may be induced or activated by a noxious stimulus such as tail clipping.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In fact, the enzyme cyclooxygenase, so-called COX, is generally believed to be the rate-limiting enzyme rather than the individual synthases.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	44	 If this were the case, the sleep patterns of WT and TG mice would be essentially identical.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	45	 It is possible, however, that the pain stimulus activated COX, which then produced an excessive amount of PGH2, the substrate for L-PGDS.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The L-PGDS step would then become the rate-limiting step under these conditions, thus leading to the production of a quantity of PGD2 larger in the TG mice than in the WT mice and ultimately to an increased amount of NREM sleep in the TG mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	47	 To test the validity of this interpretation, the amount of PGD2 produced in the brains of WT and TG mice was measured before and after the tail clipping.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	48	 As expected, the amount of PGD2 in the brains of WT and TG mice before the tail clipping were essentially identical, even though the amount of L-PGDS in the brains of TG mice was far greater than that in the WT mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The amount of PGD2 in the brains of the TG mice increased sharply and significantly for ~3 h after the tail clipping and then started to decrease thereafter.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These changes almost exactly paralleled the time course of changes in NREM sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In contrast, the PGD2 content in the brains of the WT controls remained essentially the same.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that the increase in NREM sleep in the TG mice after tail clipping was probably due to the inflicted pain causing the induction of COX or possibly some other rate-limiting enzyme(s) upstream of the L-PGDS step, resulting in an increased level of PGH2 in the brain, and prostanoid being converted to a large amount of PGD2 by the excessive amount of PGDS in these TG mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	53	L-PGDS KO mice were also generated.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Circadian profiles of NREM and REM sleep in WT and L-PGDS KO mice were almost identical, suggesting that the absence of L-PGDS does not affect basal sleep patterns (8).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Sleep is regulated as a function of prior wakefulness, and sleep propensities increase during waking or sleep deprivation (SD).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	56	 (8) investigated the effect of 6 h of SD on the amounts of NREM and REM sleep in WT and L-PGDS KO mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In the WT mice, after SD, the amount of NREM sleep increased about twofold compared with that before SD, indicating that a strong rebound of NREM sleep occurred during the recovery period.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	58	 However, in the KO mice, the amount of NREM sleep after SD was almost the same as that before SD, indicating that the NREM rebound did not occur after SD.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In contrast, REM sleep rebound after SD was observed in WT mice as well as in KO mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	60	 (8) further analyzed the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra of each type of sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The spectrum distribution pattern of NREM sleep was almost the same between WT and KO mice before SD and also after SD.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The spectrum distribution pattern of REM sleep was also identical between WT and KO mice before and after SD.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	63	 These results showed that SD did not affect the distribution pattern of the EEG power spectrum of either type of sleep in KO or WT mice.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The PGD2 content in the brains of the WT mice after SD was approximately twofold higher than that before SD, whereas the amount of PGD2 in the brains of the KO mice was unchanged after SD.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These results indicate that a deficiency of L-PGDS did not increase sleep propensity for NREM sleep during SD and that endogenous PGD2 is probably involved in the homeostatic regulation of NREM sleep (8).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	66	These results taken together indicate that 1) PGD2 is an endogenous sleep-promoting substance in the brain of mammals, 2) L-PGDS plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, and 3) the PGDS gene is the first gene to be shown to be involved in the homeostatic control of NREM sleep.

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	70	L-PGDS is mainly located in the membrane system surrounding the brain rather than in the brain parenchyma, such as leptomeninges and choroid plexus except in oligodendrocytes, and is secreted into the CSF to become a -trace protein (37).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	71	 -Trace was originally discovered by Clausen in 1961 to be the second most abundant CSF protein next to albumin.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	72	 PGD2 produced by L-PGDS also circulates in the CSF and exhibits circadian fluctuation in parallel with the sleep-wake cycle.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The infusion of PGD2 via a microdialysis probe showed that PGD2 did not induce sleep in most parts of the brain parenchyma but did effectively promote sleep when it was infused into the subarachnoid space underlying the rostral basal forebrain of rats, the so-called PGD2-sensitive zone, indicating the presence of a cluster of PGD receptors (DPR) in this area (23).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The DPR gene was originally cloned and characterized by Hirata et al.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	75	 (15); thereafter, DPR-deficient mice were generated (22).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Immunofluorescence staining of the adult mouse brain revealed that DPR immunoreactivity (IR) was mainly localized in the leptomeninges of the basal forebrain, and electron microscopic observation indicated that DPR-IR particles were predominantly located on the plasma membranes of arachnoid trabecular cells of the leptomeninges (23).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	77	 To find out how the DPR-mediated signal is transmitted into the brain parenchyma, a number of neurotransmitters, peptides, and hormones were applied to the PGD2-sensitive zone.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Adenosine, especially A2A agonists but not A1 agonists, was found to be the only compound that could mimic the somnogenic activity of PGD2 (30).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	79	Administration of CGS-21680, a specific adenosine A2A agonist but not an agonist of the A1 subtype, into the subarachnoid space induced sleep, suggesting that PGD2-induced sleep may be mediated by adenosine through the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) system.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Both CGS-21680- and PGD2-induced sleep were attenuated by pretreatment of rats with KF-17837, an A2AR antagonist, in a dose-dependent manner.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	81	 When PGD2 was applied to this area, the amount of adenosine in the extracellular space increased time and dose dependently.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, in the DPR-deficient mice, the amount of NREM sleep did not increase after PGD2 infusion; the extracellular adenosine level was also unchanged in the subarachnoid space of the rostral basal forebrain (27).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Therefore, DPR-expressing cells are considered to be important for the production and release of adenosine into the subarachnoid space of the rostral basal forebrain in mice, which results in sleep induction.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Because the baseline sleep-wake patterns of WT and DPR-deficient mice were essentially identical, these results also indicate that DPR and PGD2 are involved in the homeostatic regulation of NREM sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Quite recently, another type of receptor for PGD2, CRTH2, was discovered in the T helper type 2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils in humans and mice (1, 14).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The CRTH2 receptor is involved in the chemotactic activity of PGD2 toward these cells and is also expressed in the mouse brain.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, the expression level of mRNA for CRTH2 in the brain was essentially unchanged between the WT and DPR-deficient mice, suggesting that CRTH2 may be unrelated to the PGD2-induced sleep and adenosine release.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	88	My group has also employed A2AR KO mice to confirm our hypothesis that PGD2-induced sleep is mediated by the A2AR system.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Preliminary evidence indicated that PGD2 exerted its somnogenic effects in a manner at least partially dependent on the A2AR system (27), somewhat analogous to the interaction between A2AR and D2 dopamine receptor (7).

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	93	Wakefulness, REM sleep, and NREM sleep are driven by highly complicated patterns of neuronal and humoral activities in specific wake- and sleep-generating systems, but the target cells are usually difficult to identify in in vivo experiments.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The immediate early gene product Fos is a useful marker of neuronal activation that has facilitated the identification of wake- and sleep-active neurons.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Using Fos immunohistochemistry, Sherin and co-workers (35) recently identified a discrete cluster of neurons within the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) that may play a critical role in the generation of sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The VLPO sends specific GABAergic and galaninergic efferents to the core of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) (34), the source of the ascending histaminergic arousal system and an area considered to be a wake center.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	97	To determine the neural regions involved in the response to PGD2 or adenosine, Fos immunohistochemistry was used to identify neurons activated by infusion of PGD2 or an A2A agonist into the subarachnoid space, in collaboration with Scammell and co-workers (31).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	98	 PGD2 increased NREM sleep and induced striking expressions of Fos in the VLPO, the basal leptomeninges, and several other brain regions that may be related to sleep (31).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	99	 (31) found that infusion of PGD2 into the subarachnoid space just anterior to the preoptic area induced Fos IR in the VLPO in association with an increase in NREM sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	100	 This neuronal activation was accompanied by a decrease in the Fos level in the putative wake-active neurons of the TMN.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These observations suggest that PGD2 may induce sleep via meningeal DPR and probably adenosine A2AR with subsequent activation of the VLPO.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	102	 PGD2 does not promote sleep when infused below the posterior hypothalamus, and it is thus unlikely that wake-promoting neurons of the TMN are directly inhibited by PGD2.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	103	 PGD2 induces sleep most effectively when infused into the subarachnoid space just anterior to the preoptic area, and PGD2 can increase the firing rates of sleep-active preoptic neurons.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Within the preoptic area, sleep-active neurons are most abundant in the VLPO region.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	105	 showed that PGD2 induces Fos IR in the VLPO in proportion to the production of sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Considered together, these observations indicate that PGD2 may stimulate sleep-active VLPO neurons.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	107	The VLPO may induce sleep through inhibition of wake-promoting TMN neurons (34).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The VLPO projects heavily to the proximal dendrites and soma of TMN neurons; most of these axons contain GABA and galanin, i.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Neurons of the TMN are tonically active during the waking state, are less active during NREM sleep, and cease firing during REM sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	110	 GABA levels are elevated in the posterior hypothalamus during sleep, and electrical stimulation of the lateral preoptic area can elicit GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in TMN neurons.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Galanin also hyperpolarizes and decreases the firing rate of TMN neurons.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Furthermore, insomnia caused by preoptic neuron lesions was reversed by muscimol injection into the posterior hypothalamus in the cat (29).

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	114	 study (31) has permitted anatomic identification of wake-active TMN neurons and the demonstration of an inverse relationship between Fos IR in the VLPO and TMN.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	115	 These findings indicate that when the VLPO neuronal activity is increased that of TMN neurons is decreased, further supporting the hypothesis that GABAergic or galaninergic projections from the VLPO contribute to the inhibition of the TMN, thus generating NREM sleep by a "flip-flop" mechanism.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	116	Although more experiments are needed to work out the detailed mechanisms, my laboratory's current tentative conclusion is summarized by the scheme given in Fig.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	117	 PGD2 is produced in the trabecular cells of the arachnoid membrane and choroid plexus and circulates in the CSF and promotes sleep by inducing meningeal cells to release paracrine signaling molecules such as adenosine, which subsequently excite nearby sleep-active neurons via A2AR-expressing neurons projected to VLPO.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These cells then send inhibitory signals to downregulate the neuronal activity involved in the maintenance of wakefulness in the TMN, which contributes to arousal through the histamine H1 receptor (H1R).

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	125	Narcolepsy is a unique neurological disorder characterized by a persistent daytime sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Dysfunction of the orexin/hypocretin system in narcoleptic dogs, mice, and humans suggests that this system plays an important role in the aetiology of narcolepsy (19).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	127	 For example, mice lacking the orexin peptide display an increased propensity for REM, and also NREM sleep, and a decrease in awake time during the active period of normal rodents (5).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Canine narcolepsy is caused by a mutation in the orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) gene (21).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Furthermore, human narcolepsy is associated with a deficiency in the orexin system.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	130	 These findings indicate that orexin-OX2R interaction is involved in pathological sleep regulation in humans and animals.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, the role of orexin in physiological sleep and the mechanisms involved in vigilance control are still unknown.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The orexin neurons are exclusively localized in the lateral hypothalamus and project their fibers to most aminergic nuclei, including the histaminergic TMN, where OX2R are abundant.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It is well known that activation of the histaminergic system promotes wakefulness through activation of H1R (4, 20, 24).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Furthermore, administration of modafinil, an increasingly popular wake-promoting drug used for the treatment of narcolepsy, produces wakefulness in rats in association with activation of the TMN (32).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	135	 These findings suggest that the histaminergic system may play a role in the orexin system in narcolepsy.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	136	 (16) demonstrated that infusion of orexin A into the third ventricle of WT mice increased arousal from the second 2 h onward but did not significantly change the sleep-stage distribution during the first 2 h of infusion.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	137	 A similar delay for 1 h was also observed in rats after the intracerobroventricular administration of orexin A.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Because the TMN was recently shown to be a putative wake center, the investigators used a microdialysis probe to directly deliver orexin A to the TMN of rats.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Orexin A (5 and 25 pmol/min) promptly increased wakefulness after the start of perfusion, and the arousal effect was prolonged for 1 h after the perfusion had ended, clearly showing that the TMN or its vicinity is a direct action site for the arousal effect of orexin A (16).
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	140	The histaminergic neurons are located in the TMN, where a dense distribution of orexin A-IR processes and OX2R expression are observed.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Histamine promotes cortical wakefulness probably either through direct cortical projections or by tonic control over the sleep-generating mechanisms in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamus.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	142	 To examine whether orexin activates the histaminergic system, we employed an in vivo microdialysis method and found that perfusion of orexin A into the TMN of rats increased histamine release from both the medial preoptic area and the frontal cortex, both of which have been implicated in the arousal effect of histamine, suggesting that application of orexin A into the TMN activated the histaminergic system in the brain.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The duration of the increase in histamine release from the medial preoptic area and the frontal cortex almost paralleled that of the arousal effect.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	144	 These results are supported by the observation that orexin A markedly increased the basal firing rate of histaminergic neurons in vitro and suggest that activation of the histaminergic system is involved in the orexin A-induced wakefulness.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	145	Histamine has been reported to promote wakefulness through activation of H1R.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	146	 H1R KO mice provided a valuable tool to study the role of the histaminergic system in orexin A-induced arousal.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	147	 H1R KO mice were initially generated by Inoue et al.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	148	 in 1996 (18), and their behavior and their neuropharmacological characteristics have been investigated in detail.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Although these authors reported that mice lacking H1R showed a significant decrease in ambulation in an open field and on an activity wheel, electrophysiological studies have not been carried out so far.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	150	Results from my laboratory (16) showed that mice of each genotype displayed essentially the same amounts of sleep and wakefulness under basal conditions, yet orexin A infusion into the TMN significantly increased the wakefulness in WT mice but not at all in the H1R KO mice, clearly indicating that H1R plays a crucial role in mediating orexin A-induced arousal.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Nevertheless, contrary to the narcoleptic symptoms manifested in orexin KO mice, these symptoms were not detected in any of the H1R KO mice examined, as judged either by electrophysiological criteria or from the results of infrared video recordings.

0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	166	Although the molecular genetic approach to sleep research has become an increasingly powerful tool and has yielded numerous interesting and sometimes unexpected experimental results, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are not yet clear in most instances.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	167	 It is somewhat surprising that in most, if not all, of these genetically manipulated mice, the circadian sleep patterns are usually essentially unchanged.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This is probably due, in large part, to the postgenomic events such as the complex and diverse nature of the neuronal and humoral regulatory circuits as well as the compensatory changes during development.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Many prominent changes in phenotypes became visible after postgenomic conditioning, such as pain stimulus, SD, and so forth, as exemplified by several instances in this review.
0.39352274.11796702.html.plaintext.txt	170	Gene targeting, which either introduces specific mutations or creates null mutations (KO) or excessive expression (TG), is obviously a powerful tool in biology.

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	9	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We investigated the effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin-A-induced feeding and prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of the rat brain.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Adrenalectomy (ADX) reduced orexin-A-induced feeding over 4 h by about 60%, compared with shams, an effect that was reversed by corticosterone (CORT) replacement.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ADX had no effect on prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the LHA in either the morning or the evening; however, message was up-regulated by CORT in the morning but not the evening.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	12	 An increased number of emulsion grains per cell in the LHA suggests that this is a specific increase in prepro-orexin mRNA and is not due to an increased number of cells expressing message.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Prepro-orexin mRNA levels in the LHA were elevated 4 h after injection of lipopolysaccharide, compared with saline-injected controls.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Partial but not complete abolition of orexin-A-induced feeding by ADX suggests that orexin-A-induced feeding may be mediated through glucocorticoid-dependent and glucocorticoid-independent pathways.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the morning increased prepro-orexin mRNA after CORT replacement demonstrates that orexin expression is sensitive to increased concentrations of glucocorticoids.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, the lack of effect of ADX on prepro-orexin mRNA levels suggests that endogenous glucocorticoids are not involved in tonic regulation of basal prepro-orexin expression.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Overall our data constitute a body of evidence for an integrated relationship between central orexin expression, stress, glucocorticoid manipulation, and feeding patterns in the rat.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	18	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   OREXIN (OX)-A AND OX-B (also known as hypocretins) are closely related neuropeptides derived from a single gene and processed from a 130-residue (131 residues in humans) prepro-OX precursor protein (1).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	19	 OX-A is a 33-residue peptide with identical sequence in humans and rodents, whereas human and rat OX-B differ by two residues.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	20	 OX-A and OX-B activate two G protein-coupled receptors known as OX-1 and OX-2, the OX-1 receptor having a greater affinity for OX-A over OX-B, whereas the OX-2 receptor has similar affinity for both ligands.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Central nervous system (CNS) distribution of orexins is similar in rats and humans, the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) being the predominant region of synthesis (1).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	22	The LHA has long been implicated in feeding behavior and initial observations highlighted the role of orexins in stimulating appetite (2).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, it is now clear that orexins are also involved in the regulation of sleep, arousal, locomotor activity and neuroendocrine responses (3, 4), and therefore their orexigenic activity may be secondary to other behavioral traits that influence feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In behavioral studies, orexins can modulate stress-related behavior such as grooming, and chewing of inedible material (5, 6, 7).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Orexin-containing neurones project from the LHA to many CNS areas involved in mediating stress including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and the locus coeruleus (8, 9, 10).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	26	 OX-1 and OX-2 receptors are widely and differentially distributed throughout the CNS including the PVN, suprachiasmatic nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, and ARC of the hypothalamus and also the locus coeruleus and hippocampus (11, 12, 13, 14).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These areas have individual and synergistic involvement in regulating circadian rhythm and behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stressors.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	28	The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the principal pathways mediating neuroendocrine responses to stress.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Hypothalamic neuropeptides corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulate the release of the proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide ACTH from the anterior pituitary, with consequent release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Corticosterone (CORT), the principal glucocorticoid in rodents, acts through glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and mineralocorticoid receptors within the hippocampus to negatively regulate HPA axis activity (15).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Many studies have demonstrated that orexins can influence HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations are elevated in rats after intracerebroventricular (icv) OX-A administration (5, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This is accompanied by the induction of c-fos mRNA (17) and AVP and CRF mRNAs (20) in the parvocellular subdivision of the PVN.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition, in vitro studies have revealed release of CRF peptide, but not AVP, from hypothalamic explants (19).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	35	 OX-B has also been reported to stimulate HPA axis activity (16).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Orexin expression in the rat LHA is increased after stressors such as immobilization (23), cold stress (23), or hypoglycemia (24).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Reduced secretion of plasma ACTH and cortisol is reported in patients with narcolepsy (25), a condition associated with orexin deficiency.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Therefore there is considerable evidence that orexins can modulate HPA axis activity and that orexin expression is responsive to alterations in HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	39	It is well documented that glucocorticoid administration stimulates feeding and conversely that glucocorticoid deficiency results in loss of appetite and weight loss because adrenalectomized (ADX) rats exhibit decreased feeding, which can be reversed by CORT administration (26, 27).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Therefore, orexins may not exert a direct effect on appetite regulation within the hypothalamus but may act indirectly to stimulate feeding through increased CORT secretion.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To test this hypothesis, we designed experiments to investigate the effect of ADX with or without CORT replacement on OX-A-induced feeding to determine whether endogenous CORT is involved in OX-A-induced feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We also investigated the effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression in the morning and evening to determine whether orexin expression, which exhibits a diurnal rhythm of expression (28, 29), may be correlated with the diurnal rhythm of HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Finally, we investigated the effects on orexin expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an immunological stressor that elicits a robust and prolonged activation of the HPA axis (30, 31).

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	216	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Our data reveal an integrated relationship between central orexin expression, endogenous glucocorticoid concentrations, and feeding patterns in the rat.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Our observation that central administration of OX-A increases food intake is in agreement with other groups that have demonstrated that OX-A stimulates feeding in the early light phase in intact rats (2, 37, 38).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	218	 We now demonstrate for the first time that glucocorticoids exert an important influence on OX-A-induced feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	219	 ADX significantly reduces orexin-A- induced feeding, a phenomenon that is reversible by CORT replacement at physiological concentrations.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	220	 These data provide evidence that endogenous CORT can exert an important influence on OX-A-induced food intake.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, because ADX does not completely block OX-A-induced feeding but results in about a 60% reduction, this suggests that there is a pathway mediating orexin-induced food intake that is independent of glucocorticoids.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	222	One recent study has investigated the effect of ADX on OX-A-induced feeding (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In contrast to our findings, these investigators observed no effect of ADX on OX-A-induced food intake over a 2-h period (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This may be due to the suboptimal doses of OX-A employed over a dose range 1.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	225	5 to 6 nmol, compared with 8 nmol in the present study, the latter dose being considered optimal for OX-A-induced feeding behavior (2).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	226	 These findings may also be a result of the shorter period of food intake studied (maximum of 2 h, compared with a maximum of 4 h in our study).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	227	 (39), it seems evident that ADX is associated with decreased food intake at both higher doses of OX-A at the 2-h time point, but the very small increase in food intake in response to OX-A in sham rats does not permit the ADX effect to reach significance.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The larger dose of orexin that we used elicited a greater food intake in the sham rats, compared with that observed by Drazen et al.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	229	 (39), and consequently we were able to observe a significant and reproducible decrease in orexin-induced food intake in ADX rats.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	230	Initially, this experiment was performed with only ADX and sham groups given orexin or saline.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Consequent to our observation of a significant decrease in orexin-induced food intake in the ADX group, we repeated the experiment and expanded it to include low CORT and high CORT replacement groups.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Our observations were reproducible at all time points when the full study was repeated (40).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This, together with the ability of physiological concentrations of CORT to reverse the effects of ADX on orexin-induced food intake, increases our confidence that endogenous glucocorticoids exert physiologically relevant control over orexin-induced feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	234	Our observation that orexin-induced food intake is decreased by about 60% in ADX rats is evidence that a significant component of eating behavior is dependent on endogenous CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It is known that CORT can directly stimulate appetite (41), but the indirect effects on appetite of CORT mediated through hypothalamic neuropeptides is not well understood.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	236	 A number of mechanisms may be invoked to explain the relationship among CORT, OX-A, and food intake.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	237	 CORT may stimulate endogenous orexin expression through an action at glucocorticoid receptors within the LHA or intermediary nuclei, it may act via orexin peptide release within the PVN/ARC areas of the hypothalamus, or CORT may stimulate food intake itself consequent to orexin activation of HPA axis activity.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	238	 There is also a possibility that CORT may exert its effect on food intake via other peptides that modulate appetite rather than directly through orexins.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	239	 There is a well-defined pathway of glucocorticoid feedback on CRF expression in the PVN and release from the median eminence (42).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	240	 CRF inhibits food intake and therefore increased CORT could increase food intake through its inhibitory action on CRF.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Orexin-induced feeding is enhanced by a CRF receptor antagonist, suggesting CRF involvement (43).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is also a possible mediator of orexin-induced feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Glucocorticoid manipulation results in a marked similarity between orexin and NPY effects on feeding.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	244	 ADX reduced NPY-induced food intake by about 60%, similar to the effects of ADX on orexin-induced feeding, and this was reversed by CORT replacement (44).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	245	 NPY is the most potent known inducer of food intake (45), and orexin-induced feeding can be blocked by a Y1 receptor antagonist (46).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Therefore, it is conceivable that orexin exerts its principal glucocorticoid-dependent actions on food intake through NPY, and it is the direct effects of CORT on NPY, not on orexin expression, which explains our observations.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	247	 However, we have observed a 40% increase in food intake in response to OX-A in ADX rats in the complete absence of CORT, which is strong evidence for a glucocorticoid-independent central pathway of direct orexin-induced food intake that may not be mediated through NPY.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	248	In situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed that prepro-orexin expression was restricted to the LHA, with extensions to the perifornical nucleus and posterior hypothalamic areas, in agreement with previously reported studies (37).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	249	 A novel finding from the distribution study was that prepro-OX mRNA expression measured from coronal sequential sections running 1044  microm throughout the LHA shows considerable differences between sections, emphasizing the importance of consistent choice of sections for hybridization in measuring prepro-OX mRNA in the LHA between treatment groups.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This observation confirms the need to use anatomical markers to ensure consistency of sectioning between samples.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	251	We observed an up-regulation of morning but not evening prepro-OX mRNA in the LHA after CORT administration.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Increased blood CORT may up-regulate orexin expression through the large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LHA (47, 48).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Emulsion staining established that there was no significant difference in the number of cells expressing prepro-OX between treatment groups.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Therefore, the increases in prepro-OX mRNA that we observed in response to CORT represent increased expression of prepro-OX within cells of the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	255	 There was a slight increase in prepro-OX mRNA expression in the sham group in the evening, compared with the morning, although this was not statistically significant.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Plasma CORT levels were significantly increased in the evening, compared with the morning, in sham animals in agreement with previous studies demonstrating diurnal variations in HPA axis activity (49).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	257	 However, it is important to note that CORT levels were similar in both the morning and evening replacement groups and not significantly different from morning levels in the sham animals.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It is possible that the increase in evening prepro-OX expression, although not statistically significant, may be a consequence of the circadian increase in endogenous circulating CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This increase may be sufficient to mask any further stimulatory effects on orexin expression by exogenous CORT.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Further investigations of interrelationships between the circadian cycles of HPA axis activity and orexin expression will undoubtedly shed light on regulatory mechanisms controlling the highly integrated modalities of sleep-wake patterns and feeding behavior.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	261	We found no effect of ADX alone on orexin expression in the LHA, which suggests that basal orexin expression in rats is not under tonic regulation by endogenous glucocorticoids.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In contrast, a decrease in prepro-OX mRNA expression 5 d after ADX has been reported (50).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, no data on HPA axis activity were presented in this study, so it is difficult to determine the effectiveness of ADX surgery.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In addition, there was no information about where sections were sliced from within the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Given the variability of prepro-OX expression, which we observed throughout the LHA, it is important that the choice of section is justified and well defined.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The decrease in orexin expression after ADX was reversed by dexamethasone replacement (50), an observation that is consistent with our data demonstrating CORT up-regulation of orexin expression in sham animals.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	267	 A decrease in prepro-OX mRNA levels in the LHA 10 d after ADX has also been reported, a phenomenon that could not be reversed by CORT (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	268	Discrepancies between our data and published reports on the effects of ADX on prepro-OX mRNA expression in the LHA (39, 50), and lack of agreement on the effects of exogenous glucocorticoids, may be due to methodological differences.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Our experiment used a 7-d ADX with CORT replacement, compared with previous studies using 5 d ADX with dexamethasone (50) and 10 d ADX with CORT (39).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	270	 It is instructive to compare these discrepancies with the literature on NPY expression after ADX.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Although there is a general consensus that NPY is up-regulated by glucocorticoids, reports differ on the effects on NPY expression of eliminating endogenous cortisosterone by ADX.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Short-term ADX (4 d) did not alter NPY peptide levels in the ARC or PVN (51), whereas the same group observed that long-term ADX (12 d) deceased NPY peptide levels in these areas (52).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	273	 ADX (7 d) had no effect on NPY immunoreactivity in most hypothalamic areas, one notable exception being the PVN (53).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	274	 A longer-term ADX (12 d) had no effect on prepro-NPY mRNA in the ARC (54); peptide levels were not measured in this study.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Either dexamethasone or CORT replacement up-regulated NPY mRNA, but dexamethasone was much more potent (53).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Therefore, any effects of glucocorticoid manipulation on orexin expression, as with NPY, may be dependent on the period of ADX, the concentration and type of glucocorticoid, whether orexin peptide or mRNA is measured, and how specifically defined is the hypothalamic site selected for analysis.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	277	Finally, we have demonstrated that a single injection of LPS, an immunological stressor, can up-regulate prepro-OX mRNA expression in the LHA.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Increases in prepro-OX mRNA have been reported in response to other stressors that robustly stimulate the HPA axis such as immobilization and cold stress (23) and hypoglycemia (24).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	279	 The present study expands this repertoire of stressors to include immune- mediated stress.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	280	 LPS is a potent stimulator of HPA axis activity and subsequently CORT release, and it is possible that the increase in prepro-OX mRNA may be a result of increasing blood CORT concentrations.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Further work is necessary to elucidate whether increased orexin in response to LPS is a direct result of LPS-induced CORT release or indirectly in response to increased cytokines.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	282	We may briefly speculate on the physiological importance of increased orexin expression in response to an immunological stimulus.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Orexins have been demonstrated to have analgesic properties in inflammatory-induced hyperalgesia in which the OX-1-receptor antagonist SB-334867-A reduces OX-A-mediated analgesia (55).
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	284	 This suggests that there may a hypothalamic mechanism involving orexin as an analgesic agent during neurogenic pain.

0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	286	In conclusion, these data establish that OX-A-induced feeding and prepro-OX mRNA expression are sensitive to glucocorticoid manipulation.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Up-regulation of prepro-OX expression in response to CORT may be circadian related because levels were increased in the morning but not the evening.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, further studies will be required to determine the mechanisms underlying these data.
0.17200397.15961555.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These observations highlight the interdependence of orexins and HPA axis activity and provide further insights into the role of glucocorticoids in regulating centrally mediated orexin-induced feeding and orexin expression within the brain.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	6	The human sleep-wake cycle is generated by a circadian process, originating from the suprachiasmatic nuclei, in interaction with a separate oscillatory process: the sleep homeostat.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The sleep-wake cycle is normally timed to occur at a specific phase relative to the external cycle of light-dark exposure.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	8	 It is also timed at a specific phase relative to internal circadian rhythms, such as the pineal melatonin rhythm, the circadian sleep-wake propensity rhythm, and the rhythm of responsiveness of the circadian pacemaker to light.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Variations in these internal and external phase relationships, such as those that occur in blindness, aging, morning and evening, and advanced and delayed sleep-phase syndrome, lead to sleep disruptions and complaints.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Changes in ocular circadian photoreception, interindividual variation in the near-24-h intrinsic period of the circadian pacemaker, and sleep homeostasis can contribute to variations in external and internal phase.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Recent findings on the physiological and molecular-genetic correlates of circadian sleep disorders suggest that the timing of the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms is closely integrated but is, in part, regulated differentially.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Our appreciation of the importance of the sleep-wake cycle is further enhanced when confronted with the consequences of its disruption.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Disturbance in the timing of sleep cycles occurs, for example, in response to shift work, jet lag, long work hours, and social and family demands and leads to decrements in quality of life, performance, and health.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Disorders of daily sleep patterns are also observed in blind individuals, in older people, and in sighted young individuals suffering from circadian sleep disorders.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Such disorders often lead to the use of    sleep aids; hypnotics are among the most commonly prescribed medications.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	22	Biological (circadian) clocks are thought to play an important role in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and their disorders.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recently, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of functions and mechanisms of circadian clocks in various model systems and at levels of description ranging from the intact organism to clock gene expression in vitro.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Progress has also been made in our understanding of regulation of the timing of the human sleep-wake cycle and its integration with the timing of some endogenous circadian rhythms in endocrinology and physiology.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The human sleep-wake cycle is not simply driven by the circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) but instead is generated through interactions of circadian rhythmicity, a sleep-wake oscillatory process (sleep homeostasis), circadian photoreception, as well as feedback from the sleep-wake cycle onto these processes (see Fig.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Alterations in these processes and their interactions may lead to sleep and wakefulness occurring at abnormal clock times (altered external timing) and/or out of phase with endogenous circadian rhythms (altered internal timing).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Here we describe some recent developments related to the circadian sleep propensity rhythm, sleep homeostasis, and circadian photoreception.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	37	It has long been recognized that, for an adequate description of the phenomenology of sleep-wake timing on an approximate daily time basis, two separate but interacting oscillatory processes need to be postulated: a strong circadian oscillator and a sleep-wake oscillatory process or sleep homeostat (for reviews, see Refs.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Early key evidence for the existence of these two processes included the observation of spontaneous desynchrony between the sleep-wake cycle and the circadian rhythm of body temperature during classical temporal isolation studies (6, 30) and the circadian variation of sleep duration during experimentally displaced sleep (8).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These data have been summarized in mathematical and conceptual models of the sleep-wake cycle in which the contribution of the two oscillatory processes to sleep timing was defined (13, 32, 63).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Experimental human and animal work during the past two decades has confirmed such dual regulation of sleep timing by a circadian process and a relaxation-type sleep-wake oscillatory process.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The latter process is also referred to as a sleep homeostat because, from a functional perspective, this oscillatory process regulates the average level of sleep debt.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Sleep debt increases during wakefulness and dissipates during sleep.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	43	 More recently, quantification of the relative contribution of these processes, by forced desynchrony of the sleep-wake cycle from the circadian process, has shown that these processes contribute about equally to sleep consolidation and waking performance (36, 98).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The relative contribution of these two processes to sleep structure and aspects of the electroencephalogram (EEG) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep varies widely (37, 41).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	49	Lesions of the SCN in animals and a few clinical cases in which hypothalamic areas close to the SCN were damaged have demonstrated that the strong circadian process affecting sleep timing and sleep structure is generated by the SCN (27, 46, 87).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	50	1 In humans, the SCN is thought to generate a wake or arousal signal that increases in strength throughout the biological day (i.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	51	, during the habitual wake episode), peaking in the evening hours, at ~2200 h.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The strength of this signal declines during the biological night [i.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	53	, during the habitual sleep episode (36, 48)], to reach a minimum at ~0600 h, which coincides with the temperature nadir (36).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In the absence of this circadian arousal signal, sleep-wake consolidation is lost and the monophasic sleep-wake cycle is replaced by a polyphasic sleep-wake cycle, presumably dictated primarily by sleep homeostasis.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Thus the circadian pacemaker maintains timing of the sleep-wake cycle and consolidation of sleep-wake behavior by opposing the increase in (homeostatic) sleep need associated with sustained wakefulness.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Experiments in which sleep was scheduled to occur at many circadian phases have demonstrated that a consolidated 8-h episode of sleep can only be obtained at one specific phase relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and endogenous circadian rhythmicity.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Only when sleep is initiated ~6 h before the temperature nadir, i.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Consolidation of sleep for 8 h or more is only observed when sleep is initiated ~6-8 h before the temperature nadir (dashed line).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	62	The circadian sleep-wake propensity rhythm could be generated by a circadian modulation of wake propensity, a circadian modulation of sleep propensity, or a circadian modulation of both.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Evidence that the circadian pacemaker primarily affects wake propensity has been derived from studies in squirrel monkeys.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	64	 SCN lesions lead to an increase in total sleep time per 24 h, in conjunction with the loss of circadian sleep timing (48).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Such an increase in total sleep time suggests that promotion of wakefulness is absent in the absence of the SCN.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	66	 On the other hand, both SCN lesion studies in animals and forced desynchrony studies in young and older healthy people support the view that the SCN also actively promotes sleep, in particular in the second half of the normal sleep episode (40, 97).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Thus, in the intact squirrel monkey, wakefulness in the second half of the subjective night is at its lowest levels and well below the percentage of wakefulness observed in the SCN-lesioned animal (48).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Comparisons of the REM sleep rebound after REM sleep deprivation in control and SCN-lesioned rats have demonstrated that, during the major rest phase, the SCN actively promotes entry into REM sleep (97).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In humans, sleep spindle activity is highest during the biological night.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Furthermore, sleep latencies in older people are longer than in young people at around the temperature nadir but not at other circadian phases, suggesting that the active promotion of sleep by the SCN is diminished at this circadian phase in older people (40).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	71	The waveform of the endogenously generated circadian sleep-wake propensity rhythm may change in response to variations in day length (photoperiod), such that after prolonged exposure to long dark episodes the internal biological night is extended (94, 95).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	72	The circadian arousal and/or circadian hypnotic signal(s) could be humoral and/or neural.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The circadian variation in sleep propensity is closely associated with the circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin (35, 68).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Recent functional neuroanatomic studies have identified some of the pathways by which the SCN may transmit circadian information to sleep and arousal centers in the rat.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Efferents from the SCN can modulate numerous systems, including the adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and the orexin systems (1, 7, 73, 75, 79).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Deficiencies in the orexin system have been implicated in the sleep disorder narcolepsy (81, 82).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Narcoleptic patients experience excessive daytime sleepiness and multiple sleep attacks during the day as though they were unable to maintain wakefulness.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Edgar and colleagues (33) demonstrated that, whereas the timing of the circadian modulation of sleep propensity is normal, the strength of this signal, i.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	85	Slow-wave sleep (SWS) and EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) during NREM sleep are the classical markers of the sleep homeostatic process.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Increases in SWA and visually scored SWS after sleep deprivation are not obliterated in SCN-lesioned rodents (90).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In humans, SWS and SWA decline during sleep independent of the circadian phase at which sleep occurs.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Furthermore, the duration of wakefulness predicts how much SWS and SWA occur during sleep at all circadian phases (9, 34).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Thus the localization of the sleep homeostat is likely to be distinct from the SCN and could be diffuse.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	90	 There is now convincing evidence that the time course of the sleep homeostatic process can also be monitored during wakefulness in humans.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Low-frequency components in the EEG increase as the duration of wakefulness progresses at all circadian phases (3, 19, 21, 49).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Scheduling multiple naps during the day attenuates this increase in low-frequency activity during wakefulness (22).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	93	 This is similar to the previously observed reduction of SWA during sleep following daytime naps (96).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It thus appears that low-frequency components of EEG during wakefulness are closely associated with sleep homeostasis.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Interestingly, the effects of wakefulness on both the sleep and wake EEG are most pronounced in frontal cortical areas of the brain (20, 21, 49, 50).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Whether and how these local changes in the EEG are related to the circadian and sleep-wake-dependent modulation of performance remains to be established.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	97	A number of hypotheses on the neurochemical basis of sleep homeostasis have been put forward (for review, see Ref.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	98	 There is now substantial evidence for a role of the neuromodulator adenosine in mediating sleep homeostatic signals.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Levels of adenosine in basal forebrain areas increase during sustained wakefulness, and administration of adenosine to these brain areas leads to sleep (11).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Such a role for adenosine would be consistent with the popular use of the adenosine antagonist caffeine to combat sleepiness.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The kinetics of the sleep homeostatic process in mice, as indexed by EEG SWA, has been shown to be under strong genetic control.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Quantitative trait loci analysis has identified genomic regions that contribute to this genetic control and that contain genes that regulate adenosine levels (52).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	103	The concept that circadian and sleep homeostatic processes are functionally and anatomically distinct can be further investigated by studying sleep timing and structure and responses to challenges of the sleep homeostat in mammals with altered clock genes (99).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The first of such studies indicated that sleep duration and the response to sleep loss may be affected by mutations of the murine Clock gene.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Interestingly, REM sleep, the sleep stage most strongly regulated by circadian processes, is most modified in Clock-mutant mice (80).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Some people suffering from a human familial form of advanced sleep-phase syndrome (ASPS) have been shown to carry an altered hPer2 gene (91), one of the key clock genes.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	107	 It appears that in patients suffering from this disorder sleep structure is within the normal range (55, 84).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	108	Clock genes may be involved in the generation of sleep-wake oscillatory processes.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	109	 During pharmacologically induced desynchrony between rest-activity cycles and circadian rhythms in rats entrained to 24-h light-dark cycles, some clock genes (rPer1, rPer2, and rBmal1, but not rClock) in the parietal cortex and caudate putamen oscillate in synchrony with the rest-activity cycle.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In contrast, clock gene expression in the SCN remained phase locked to the light-dark cycle and the rhythm of pineal melatonin (78).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	116	Although it was once thought that light was not a major synchronizer of human circadian rhythms, it has now been shown that multiple rhythms driven by the SCN, including the rhythms of sleep propensity and pineal melatonin, can be shifted by scheduled ocular light exposure (31).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Current estimates of the sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to light indicate that ordinary room light exerts an effect that is 50% of the maximal effect induced by very bright indoor light (100).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Similar high sensitivities have been obtained in dose-response studies of the direct effects of light on melatonin suppression, subjective alertness, and EEG and electrooculogram correlates of alertness (23).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Such studies indicate that the range of illuminances (expressed in lux) over which light exerts a differential effect spans two to three log units.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Such a small dynamic range has previously been observed for circadian responses in animal studies and is in accordance with the hypothesis that the effects of light on the circadian timing system are mediated by a photoreceptive system distinct from the system mediating vision (77).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	121	Quantitative aspects of circadian photoreception such as the relationship between duration and intensity of light and the phase shifting effects are under intense investigation and have shown that the first minutes of light exposure are most effective (85).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In mice, circadian phase shifting and neuroendocrine and pupillary responses to light can be elicited in the absence of rods and cones, suggesting that another ocular photoreceptor is involved in mediating these effects (53, 76).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In humans, the spectral sensitivity of the circadian photoreceptive system has been investigated using light-induced melatonin suppression as the dependent variable.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The assessment of the relative efficacy of different wavelengths of light varying from 420 to 600 nm on suppression of melatonin has now demonstrated that short wavelengths (blue light) are most effective in suppressing melatonin (18).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	125	 A detailed analysis of these data suggested that neither rods nor cones primarily mediate the light-induced neuroendocrine response (17, 89).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This neuroendocrine response is often used as a proxy for the circadian phase shifting effects of light, but it remains to be established whether the spectral sensitivity for phase shifting is similar to that observed for melatonin suppression.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, these data are the first compelling evidence that the human circadian photoreceptive system is distinct from the photoreceptive system involved in image formation.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	128	 It has been hypothesized that melanopsin located in the ganglion cells of the human inner retina is the photopigment mediating these circadian light responses (83).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The question of how this spectral sensitivity of the human circadian system is related to its entrainment to the natural light-dark cycle remains to be investigated.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	130	Phase shifts of endogenous circadian rhythms, including the sleep propensity rhythm, can be induced by broad-spectrum light exposure even when the sleep-wake cycle is kept constant (31).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Thus most of the effects of light on the circadian pacemaker are not necessarily mediated through the sleep-wake oscillator and are most likely mediated by the direct projection from the retinal ganglion cells to the SCN, the retinohypothalamic tract.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The sleep-wake cycle nevertheless plays an important role in regulating light input to the pacemaker because we close our eyes to sleep and open our eyes when awake (see Fig.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Consideration of the interaction between sleep-wake behavior and light input to the light-sensitive pacemaker may be important for the understanding of synchronization of the human circadian system.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Previously, it was postulated that effects of light on the circadian pacemaker were in part mediated through a sleep-wake oscillator, which in turn would affect the circadian oscillator.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Currently, the mechanisms by which light could exert such direct effects on the sleep-wake oscillatory process are unknown.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Direct projections from the retina to extra-SCN hypothalamic areas, such as the ventrolateral preoptic area, which is known to contain sleep-active neurons (74), may play a role in mediating such effects of light.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This view of entrainment by light via the sleep-wake oscillator also implies that the sleep-wake cycle exerts an influence on the circadian pacemaker.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Experiments in which the sleep-wake cycle was inverted have shown that under these conditions the feedback effects are small (44).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, there is now growing evidence from both animal and human studies that such feedback from the sleep-wake cycle onto the SCN could nevertheless be significant, in particular for the maintenance of entrainment (5, 54, 62, 96a).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	159	The notion that the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker is near 25 h has been recently challenged.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	160	 It was recognized that the exquisite sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to room levels of light may have affected the period estimate in the classical free running experiments from which the estimate of 25 h was derived (60).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	161	 During the past decade, a number of laboratories have investigated this aspect of human circadian rhythmicity by assessing intrinsic periodicity under conditions in which the confounding effects of room light exposure were controlled.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Such experiments in sighted subjects (young, older, or adolescent) and in blind adult subjects in whom the circadian system is not entrained yielded estimates of intrinsic period that are close to 24 h (see Refs.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	163	 26, 28, 38, 57, 69, and references therein).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Relatively minor discrepancies between these estimates in populations of sighted and blind subjects may be related to selection of subjects included in the population average, aftereffects of entrainment to light on the observed period, study methodology, or differential control of potential nonphotic time cues (28).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Experiments in which the confounding effects of light were carefully controlled have now shown that, in young subjects, phase angle of entrainment is correlated with the intrinsic period of the circadian pacemaker.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	166	 One estimate of the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker under such conditions is 24 h and 11 min, with a remarkably small variation (SD of 8 min) (28).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This small variation is nevertheless associated with entrained phase, such that a 6-min difference in intrinsic period leads to an approximately 1-h difference in entrained phase (45).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	168	In healthy older people without sleep complaints and without sleep disorders, circadian rhythms of melatonin, core body temperature, and cortisol occur at an earlier clock time than that in young adults (25, 43, 45a).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In older people, habitual wake time has been shown to also occur earlier relative to the core body temperature and plasma melatonin rhythms.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This internal circadian phase advance of wake time has also been observed during forced desynchrony of the sleep-wake cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm of plasma melatonin and core body temperature (40, 43, 45a).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Therefore, the age-related change in the interaction of the sleep-wake oscillator and endogenous circadian rhythmicity is such that wake time is not only advanced with respect to clock time (altered external timing) but also advanced relative to internal circadian rhythms (altered internal timing).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although the advance of entrained phase (external timing) could theoretically be explained by an age-related reduction of the intrinsic period, the simultaneous advance of wake time relative to endogenous circadian rhythms could not.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	173	 (A plot of the internal and external phase relationships in these two categories, compared with the theoretical changes in internal phase relationships due to changes in period, illustrates this point; see Fig.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	174	) In addition, empirical assessments of the intrinsic period in young and older people have yielded identical estimates (28).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus the age-related 1-h difference in the timing of the core body temperature and melatonin rhythm between young and older people cannot currently be accounted for by an age-related reduction in intrinsic period (28, 57), suggesting that changes in the period of the circadian system are not primarily responsible for the age-related changes in sleep timing.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, it may be worthwhile to point out that, according to the observed association between entrained phase and intrinsic period in young subjects, an age-related difference in intrinsic period of only ~6 min would be required to account for the age-related difference in entrained phase (45).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	186	People vary in their diurnal preference for the timing of activity and sleep, and this preference is paralleled in their physiology.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In morning types, wake time, the temperature nadir, and the plasma melatonin rhythm occur at earlier clock times than in evening types (10, 42, 58, 59).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Sleep deprivation studies have indicated that the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation is not markedly different between morning and evening types (64).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Furthermore, differences in the timing of circadian melatonin and core body temperature rhythms persist under constant routine conditions (in the absence of a sleep-wake cycle), demonstrating that such differences are not a direct consequence of altered sleep-wake timing.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Examinations of the internal phase relationships between the sleep-wake cycle and endogenous circadian rhythms have led to the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that morning types, who wake up at an earlier clock time, wake later relative to the circadian cycle of temperature and melatonin (42).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The opposite is true for evening types.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	192	 As previously discussed, in young subjects, small variations in intrinsic period are correlated with variations in diurnal preference.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	193	 A 6-min difference in intrinsic period is correlated with a change in Horne-Ostberg rating (a measure of diurnal preference) by 5-10 points (out of 70-point range) (45).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These data indicate that differences in intrinsic period of a magnitude smaller than those associated with clock mutants in rodents have significant consequences for sleep-wake timing and diurnal preference in humans.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	200	ASPS and delayed sleep-phase syndromes (DSPS) are often thought to be associated with advanced and delayed timing of endogenous circadian rhythms, such as temperature and melatonin.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Surprisingly, few studies have carefully characterized the circadian physiology in such sleep disorders.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	202	In an examination of the internal and external phase relationships in DSPS patients, delayed bedtime, delayed wake time, and a later clock time for the onset and peak of the melatonin rhythm were reported (88, 92).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In addition, bedtime and wake time were reportedly delayed relative to the melatonin rhythm.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Therefore, DSPS patients appear not only to wake up at a later clock time but also at a later phase of the endogenous rhythm of melatonin and temperature.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The observation is in contrast to evening types who wake up earlier in the endogenous circadian cycle.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	206	 An association between DSPS and polymorphisms in the clock gene hPer3 has been reported, suggesting that circadian processes may contribute to this condition (47).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	207	The timing of sleep and circadian rhythms of temperature and melatonin in individuals suffering from familial forms of ASPS has been described.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	208	 As may be expected, the timing of both sleep and endogenous circadian rhythms was advanced by as much as 4 h (55, 84).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The internal phase relationships between sleep and the circadian rhythms of melatonin and temperature appeared normal in these patients.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	210	, SWS and REM sleep expressed as a percentage of total sleep time) also appeared normal, suggesting that the primary change in these patients is not associated with the sleep homeostatic facet of sleep-wake regulation but rather in the circadian aspect.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	211	 So far, assessments of intrinsic period in the absence of the confounding effects of light are not available for such patients.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The free-running period, assessed in a classical free-running paradigm, has been reported to be rather short in one patient (55).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This may be related to the change in a hPer2 phosphorylation site, which has been reported in a separate study for some but not all ASPS patients (91).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	218	Changes in circadian photoreception or changes in the responsiveness of the circadian pacemaker to light due to changes downstream from the circadian photoreceptors may contribute to variations in the entrained phase.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Initial comparisons of the responsiveness to light in young and older healthy volunteers suggested that older people were somewhat less sensitive to light in the phase-advance portion of the phase response curve (PRC).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The responsiveness to light in the phase-delay portion of the PRC was not significantly different (61).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that changes in responsiveness of the pacemaker to light underlie the observed phase advance.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The phase advance in older people may be mediated by the observed internal phase advance of wake time.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	223	 As a result, this would increase light exposure in the phase-advance region of the PRC and would thereby contribute to the advance of endogenous circadian rhythms (43).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This hypothesis highlights the potential role of sleep-wake behavior and changes in internal phase relationship between sleep and circadian rhythms in the determination of entrained phase.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	225	Alteration of light input and the responsiveness of the oscillator to light have been indirectly examined in studies of circadian rhythms in blind subjects.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Despite massive loss of visual function, the majority of blind individuals with some degree of light perception maintain normal circadian rhythmicity (29, 69, 72).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Similar observations were reported for rodless mice (51).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	228	 No significant associations have been observed between circadian rhythm abnormalities and specific retinal abnormalities.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In fact, within totally blind subjects, the best predictor of circadian rhythm disorders appears to be the lack of intact eyes (69), an observation which is consistent with the distinct nature of the circadian photoreceptive system.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The report of several blind individuals who, despite having no conscious light perception, are sensitive to light-induced suppression of melatonin (29) is consistent with a functional circadian photoreceptive system.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	231	 These subjects reported no cyclic sleep disorders and presumably have photically entrained circadian rhythms despite no visual function.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Alternatively, the lack of association between retinal abnormalities and entrainment may be explained by the effects of nonphotic time cues (regular sleep-wake cycle, societal constraints, etc), exerting sufficient drive onto the pacemaker to maintain entrainment (62).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	233	A variety of abnormal sleep-wake patterns, as well as internal and external phase relationships have been reported in totally blind subjects.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Approximately 25% have normally timed hormonal rhythms relative to the light-dark cycle, clock time, and the sleep-wake cycle.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	235	 A further 25% have hormonal rhythms entrained to an abnormal clock time but maintain more or less normal sleep timing.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The remainder have nonentrained (non-24-h) hormonal rhythms and non-24-h sleep-wake cycles.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These subjects attempt to maintain a normal internal phase relationship but are often unsuccessful because of the conflict between internal circadian timing and external 24-h time cues (70).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Thus, in these totally blind subjects, not only do we observe abnormal phase relationships of endogenous circadian rhythms relative to clock time (altered external timing) but also highly abnormal internal and external phase relationships with respect to sleep timing (altered internal timing).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Such observations represent the most extreme example of the consequences of altering the phase angle between sleep and the internal circadian system.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Exogenous melatonin administration (5 or 10 mg/day) can be used to successfully treat non-24-h sleep-wake disorder (71, 86) and, if appropriately timed, can realign both abnormal internal phase relationships and the relationship between the circadian system and the external 24-h social day.

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	245	Self-reported sleep need and sleep duration are found to vary between individuals.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	246	 First, sleep regulation in habitual short and long sleepers has been studied in the context of the circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Analyses of both the sleep EEG and waking EEG indicate that short sleepers live under a higher homeostatic sleep pressure (2, 4).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Second, sleep duration declines across the life span.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It has been well documented that SWS and SWA decline with age (24, 93).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These findings suggest that sleep need may decline with age.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The age-related reduction in SWS and sleep duration is observed at all circadian phases, even when older subjects are scheduled to a rest-activity cycle similar to young subjects (40) (see Fig.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Thus major differences in activity or daytime napping cannot be the primary cause of such changes.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Analyses of awakenings in young and older subjects have further shown that it is primarily the consolidation of NREM sleep that is impaired in older subjects (39).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Quantitative analyses of the EEG in young and older subjects have demonstrated that the age-related changes in the spectral composition of the EEG are a near-mirror image of the changes induced by an increase in homeostatic sleep pressure after sleep deprivation (24, 67) and opposite to the effects of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA on the EEG (65).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In addition, the age-related changes in the EEG appear most prominent in frontal cortical areas (66).
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the major aspect of age-related changes in human sleep are related to the extra-SCN sleep process.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Whether this change reflects an age-related reduction in sleep need or age-related changes in the ability to maintain sleep remains unclear.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Age-related changes in the circadian aspect of sleep regulation appear limited to a reduction of the active promotion of sleep in the early morning (40).

0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Consideration of both external and internal sleep timing may provide new parameters to quantify the phenomenology of normal and abnormal sleep regulation.
0.18866605.11796701.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Detailed description and controlled examination of both internal and external phase relationships and comprehensive description of sleep and circadian physiology could clarify the contribution of circadian processes, sleep homeostasis, and circadian photoreception and their molecular-genetic basis to the phenomenology of sleep timing.

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	5	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are classically expressed on antigen-presenting cells of the hematopoietic lineage but have also been described on epithelial cells in association with autoimmunity.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this context, however, it remains debatable whether class II MHC molecules are the initiating event or rather the consequence of the autoimmune attack.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, the role of epithelial class II expression once the autoimmune attack has begun is unknown.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We generated transgenic mice expressing in the thyroid follicular cells the class II transactivator, the master regulator of all the genes in the class II MHC pathway.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The study used a cohort of 245 CBA/J mice (127 wild-type and 118 transgenic), both in basal conditions (n = 63) and at different time points after immunization with mouse thyroglobulin (n = 182).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In basal conditions, transgenic mice were similar to wild-type controls and did not develop spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis, despite the aberrant expression of class II MHC molecules on thyrocytes.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	11	 After immunization, thyroiditis was 8% more severe in transgenics than controls (95% confidence interval from 1.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	12	033), especially during the florid stages of disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings suggest that expression of class II MHC molecules on epithelial cells is not sufficient to initiate autoimmunity but mildly modulates an already established autoimmune attack against the target organ.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	14	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES OF the thyroid gland, represented by Graves  disease and Hashimoto s thyroiditis and collectively referred to as autoimmune thyroiditis, are the most common autoimmune diseases (1) and an excellent model of organ-specific autoimmunity (2).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	15	 They are chronic conditions initiated by loss of immunological tolerance to thyroid-restricted self-antigens (such as TSH receptor, thyroperoxidase, and thyroglobulin), a loss that leads to thyroid dysfunction via immune-mediated inflammation and ultimately to the clinical phenotype.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	16	The loss of tolerance is considered to result from the combined effect of environmental factors, such as iodine, and gene variants.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For example, individuals with an A-to-G polymorphism in the noncoding, 3' region of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 gene have a 2.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	18	45-fold increased risk of developing Graves  disease or Hashimoto s thyroiditis, respectively (3).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The first described and most potent genetic influence known to affect susceptibility to autoimmune thyroiditis, however, is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The association between MHC and autoimmunity was originally reported in 1971, first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (4) and then in mice with experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (5).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	21	The MHC is located on the short arm of the human chromosome 6, spanning 3.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	22	6 megabases of complete and annotated DNA sequence (6).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Its main functions are to guide the intracellular processing of antigens and to display antigenic peptides on the plasma membrane for recognition by T lymphocytes (7).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It is the most gene-dense region of the genome, containing 224 loci (96 pseudogenes and 128 expressed genes) grouped in three classes.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Class II MHC genes are constitutively expressed only on hematopoietic cells involved in antigen presentation (dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, and cortical thymic epithelial cells) but can be induced by inflammatory stimuli on many other cell types (such as endothelial cells, hepatocytes, ss-cells of the pancreas, and thyrocytes).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Little is known about the biological significance of this observation, although it has been implicated in allograft rejection (8) and subsequently in autoimmunity.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In this field, Bottazzo and Feldman hypothesized that class II MHC molecules, when aberrantly expressed on epithelial cells, confer to them antigen-presenting functions favoring the initiation of autoimmune diseases (9, 10).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	28	The MHC is also the region that has been associated with the greatest number of human diseases, ranging from narcolepsy (11) to primary immunodeficiencies (12) to most, if not all, autoimmune conditions (13, 14).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The strength of this association, which is classically measured by relative risks (RR) or odds ratios, varies from low, such as a RR of 2.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	30	5 for myasthenia gravis in a person carrying the DR3 allele (15), to medium, such as a RR of 30 for DQ8 and type 1 diabetes (16), to high, such as a RR of 109 for A29 and birdshot retinochoroidopathy (17).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For Graves  disease, the MHC (DR3) association is mild, with RRs ranging from 1.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For Hashimoto s thyroiditis, the contribution of MHC haplotypes to disease is less definitive, although they may play a role in the familial clustering of thyroiditis and diabetes (19).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	33	Given the biological plausibility, the replication of the findings, and the strength of many of these associations, MHC molecules are considered in the causal pathway that leads to autoimmune disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	34	 There are, however, important factors that could confound the above-described association.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	35	 First, MHC loci are found together at frequencies much higher than would be expected by random combination of their frequencies in the population.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is thus possible that the genes causing disease are not the MHC genes per se but rather genes that travel with the MHC.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	37	 For example, polymorphisms of the LMP2 and LMP7 genes, which are embedded within the class II region, have been associated with ankylosing spondylitis (20).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In addition, the same allele that is associated with a particular disease is also common in the normal, unaffected population, and actually the majority of patients with the susceptible allele do not develop autoimmune disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Finally, it is unknown whether to initiate autoimmunity MHC molecules have to be expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells within secondary lymphoid organs or rather on nonhematopoietic cells of the target organ itself, such as the thyroid follicular cell in the case of autoimmune thyroiditis.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	40	To investigate whether MHC class II molecules when expressed on thyrocytes play a causal role in autoimmune thyroiditis, we developed transgenic mice that express specifically in the thyroid gland the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of the MHC class II pathway (21, 22).

0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The difference in severity, although higher in transgenics at all time points, became significantly higher only at d 35 after immunization.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	248	 These results suggest that thyrocytes expressing class II MHC molecules play a secondary role in the initiation phase but can serve as better targets and facilitate greater immunopathology, once the process has already begun.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Lack of significant difference in thyroiditis severity at earlier time points (d 10 to 28) can be explained by the fact that the immunization protocol we used was very effective in inducing thyroid lesions in the majority of the mice (incidence comprised between 86 and 95% in wild-type and 100% in transgenic).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	250	The notion that class II MHC molecules on epithelial cells have a modulatory role once the autoimmune attack has begun is intriguing and may have possible relevance to Hashimoto s thyroiditis and Graves  disease (47).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In these diseases, in fact, collectively referred to as autoimmune thyroiditis, the expression of class II molecules may indicate a particularly severe stage of the disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This question is difficult to assess in humans; the use of a mouse model is essential because it allows us to analyze disease over a period of time, rather than at a single time point.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	253	The greater severity of thyroid lesions displayed by thyr-CIITA transgenic was not a result of a greater number or function of activated T cells, considering that the CD4 T cells in the cervical lymph nodes expressed similar levels of activation markers in both wild-type and transgenics.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The difference is more likely explained by the fact that thyrocytes expressing class II MHC molecules are better recognized by autoreactive CD4 T cells once these T cells have already expanded.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In other words, thyrocytes may serve as endogenous immunogens that potentiate and expand the reactivity of T cells initially selected by the thyroglobulin immunization protocol.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	256	 It is well established that T cell activation requires formation of a specialized cell-cell junction with the antigen-presenting cell, called the immunological synapse, which facilitates the outcome of immune recognition (48).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The center of the synapse is occupied by T-cell receptor/CD3 complexes and CD4 coreceptors on the T cell side and by MHC/peptide complexes on the antigen-presenting side.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Also in the center are costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD40 ligand on T cells and B7 and CD40 on antigen-presenting cells.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The periphery of the synapse is instead occupied by integrins, such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and CD2 on T cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CD58 on antigen-presenting cells.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	260	 To function efficiently as antigen-presenting cell, the thyrocytes that aberrantly express MHC class II molecules should also express costimulatory molecules and integrins.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Thyrocytes from patients with Graves  disease and Hashimoto s thyroiditis have been shown to express the integrins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and CD58 (49, 50) and the costimulator CD40 (51, 52).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The expression on thyrocytes of B7, probably the most potent costimulator, is less firmly established, although it was reported in Hashimoto s thyroiditis (53) and differentiated thyroid tumors (54).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	263	 B7 costimulation could also be supplied in trans from professional antigen-presenting cells to parenchymal cells (55).
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Thus, in theory, thyrocytes aberrantly expressing class II MHC molecules possess the signal transduction circuitry necessary for full T cell activation, although it is unknown whether individual components can associate in the supramolecular activation complex.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Here we show that expression on thyrocytes of class II MHC is insufficient to initiate autoimmune thyroiditis.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	266	 These results emphasize the importance of location in the initiation of the immune response, a location that likely requires the interaction between autoreactive T cell and antigen-presenting cells within the secondary lymphoid organs.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	267	In conclusion, this study reports that expression of class II MHC molecules on epithelial thyroid cells is not required for the initiation of an autoimmune attack to the thyroid.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The initiation, then, seems to be mainly mediated by the professional antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Once the immune recognition has begun, however, the aberrant expression of class II on nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells can facilitate disease progression and yields a more severe disease.
0.09531622.15591134.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Additional studies are required to fully explain the intriguing association between MHC molecules and autoimmune diseases.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We investigated activation of orexin and other neurons during insulin-induced hypoglycemia using the immediate early gene product Fos.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Insulin (50 U/kg) lowered plasma glucose by  > 50% after 5 h and stimulated feeding sixfold compared with saline-injected controls.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Hypoglycemic rats allowed to feed and normoglycemic controls both showed sparse Fos-positive (Fos+) neurons in the LHA and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) and showed none in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which relays visceral feeding signals to the LHA.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In the LHA, total numbers of Fos+ neurons were comparable in fed hypoglycemic and control groups (60  plus or minus  6 vs.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In parallel studies, whole hypothalamic orexin-A levels were not changed in hypoglycemic rats, whether fasted or freely fed, whereas orexin-B levels were 10-fold higher in hypoglycemic fasted rats than in control and hypoglycemic fed groups.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These data support our hypothesis that orexin neurons are stimulated by falling glucose levels but are readily inhibited by signals related to nutrient ingestion and suggest that they may functionally link with neuronal activity in the NTS.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Orexin-A and -B may play specific roles in behavioral or neuroendocrine responses to hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	21	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is important in the overall regulation of feeding behavior and body weight (1).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Specifically, it is crucial for the intense hunger that is caused by hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Eating is one component of the concerted metabolic response that is mounted to restore normal blood glucose levels.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Lesions of the LHA abolish the hyperphagic response to hypoglycemia induced by insulin (2) and also to neuroglycopenia caused by 2-deoxyglucose (3).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	25	The neurochemical identities of the LHA neurons and pathways that mediate hypoglycemia-induced hyperphagia remain uncertain.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The LHA contains glucose-sensitive neurons that are stimulated by hypoglycemia, and these account for 25% of the LHA neurons (4,5).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Hypoglycemia mainly activates LHA glucose-sensitive neurons indirectly (6), and pathways ascending from the brainstem are thought to be particularly important.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These include a projection from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) (7,8), which relays information from vagal afferents including glucoreceptors in the gut and liver (9).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	29	 About 75% of recorded NTS neurons respond with altered electrical activity to blood glucose fluctuations within the physiological range (10).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	30	Recent evidence suggests that some of the LHA neurons that respond to hypoglycemia express the peptides known as orexins (11) or hypocretins (12).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The hypocretins have sequences similar to but longer than orexins.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Hypocretin-1 includes the orexin-A sequence with five extra amino acids at the NH2-terminus and one at the COOH-terminus, whereas hypocretin-2 has one extra residue at the COOH-terminus of the orexin-B sequence (12).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Orexin-A and -B are 33- and 28-residue peptides, respectively, derived from prepro-orexin (13), and were named for their ability to stimulate feeding when injected intracerebroventricularly or into the LHA (13,14,15,16,17,18,19).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Orexins are expressed solely in a neuronal population that is restricted to the perifornical LHA and zona incerta (20,21,22,23,24).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This region has reciprocal connections with numerous hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic structures involved in feeding behavior, including the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the NTS (20,24).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	36	We and others previously showed that hypothalamic pre-pro-orexin mRNA levels were increased by prolonged fasting and by insulin-induced hypoglycemia when food was not available (13,25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We suggested that orexin neurons are stimulated by falling blood glucose levels but inhibited by food ingestion and that they might participate in the on-off regulation of short-term feeding behavior (25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	38	 It is now clear that orexin neurons are those previously identified as containing "prolactin-like immunoreactivity," which are known to be activated by hypoglycemia (26).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	39	Here, we explored further the relationship between hypoglycemia, food intake, and orexin neuronal activation and the possible mediatory role of the NTS.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We again induced acute (5-h) hypoglycemia with insulin in groups of rats that were either allowed to eat freely or were fasted throughout.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We first used the early response gene marker Fos to map neuronal activation in the LHA, PVN, ARC, and NTS together with immunohistochemical identification of orexin neurons.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In a parallel experiment, we used specific radioimmunoassays to measure changes in whole hypothalamic orexin-A and -B concentrations under the same experimental conditions.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Two groups (n = 6 for each) were given an intermediate-duration insulin (50 U/kg Insulatard) intraperitoneally at 0900 to induce hypoglycemia, as in our previous study (25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	50	 One hypoglycemic group was allowed to feed freely, whereas the other was food deprived.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The third group (euglycemic controls) received the same volume of saline intraperitoneally and was allowed to eat freely (n = 6).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The study was terminated 5 h after injection, when food intake was measured in the rats allowed to eat.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The rats were killed, and tissue was prepared for immunohistochemistry as below.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The rats were deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of Hypnorm/Hypnovel (3 mg/kg), and blood was collected and centrifuged.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Free-floating sections were rinsed several times and stored in immunobuffer (0.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	63	 A preliminary study using chromogenic double-labeling detection of Fos and orexin immunoreactivities (i.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	64	, avidin-biotin complex plus diaminobenzidine for Fos, and Vector blue alkaline phosphatase detection for orexin) did not in all cases allow us to determine whether Fos-positive (Fos+) nuclear profiles lay within orexin-containing cells, especially where cell bodies were strongly orexin-positive.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To overcome this difficulty, we developed a fluorescent double-labeling protocol similar to that used by others to study colocalization of receptors and Fos+ neurons (27).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This technique demonstrated patterns of Fos and orexin immunoreactivities that were identical to those we obtained using chromogenic detection and are similar to previous reports (28,29).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The fluorescence method in combination with confocal analysis proved to be more powerful than histochemical detection methods because it revealed greater subcellular and three-dimensional (3-D) detail.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In particular, we could interrogate the confocal 3-D volume in cases where the association of Fos and orexin was ambiguous (see "Image analysis.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	69	Fluorescence double-labeling was performed on every fifth frontal section through the hypothalamic region that contained orexin neurons and on every tenth frontal section through the medulla at the level of the NTS.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	71	The sections were incubated overnight with a polyclonal sheep anti-Fos antibody (1:3,000; Genosys, Cambridge U.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	72	), then for 2 h with biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), followed by Alexa 488-conjugated NeutrAvidin (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Sections were next incubated overnight in a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a partial sequence (amino acids 14-33) of orexin-A (1:1,000; raised in-house at SmithKline Beecham, as reported before [29]), followed by Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Before each incubation, the sections were washed thoroughly three times for 10 min in immunobuffer.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The specificity of the anti-orexin serum was tested by preincubating the primary antiserum with excess synthetic orexin-A (50  microg/ml) for 2 h before use or by omitting the primary antiserum from the incubation steps.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In both cases, selective staining of cell profiles was abolished (29).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	80	 To test for specificity of the Fos antiserum, the primary antiserum was omitted from the incubation procedure, and this resulted in no selective immunostaining.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	81	Fluorescence double-labeling was visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS-SP; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	87	 For the LHA, Fos+ nuclei were counted and categorized as whether or not they lay within an orexin-containing neuronal cell body; in cases where coincidence was ambiguous, a 3-D volume image was constructed and rotated to clarify the relationship.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Counts were expressed as the number of nuclei per 500 x 500- microm square field, bounded medially by the fornix and extending laterally toward the internal capsule and dorsally toward the zona incerta.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	89	 For the PVN, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN), and ARC, sections were similarly imaged and Fos+ nuclei counted in identified anatomical areas contained within a 1,000 x 1,000- microm square field.

0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	153	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The LHA is one of several brain regions that cooperates in the control of energy homeostasis; it was previously regarded as a feeding center because lesions here can cause a sustained decrease in food intake and profound weight loss (1).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The LHA contains distinct neuronal populations that express specific appetite-stimulating neurotransmitters, including the orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) (32), and is also a site of projection of other neurons that release orexigenic neurotransmitters notably the NPY neurons of the ARC (33).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The LHA appears to be crucial in mediating the intense hyperphagia induced when blood glucose levels fall into the hypoglycemic range, because LHA lesions abolish this selectively without impairing the hyperphagic response to other conditions such as fasting (2).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	156	Previous studies by our group and others (11,25,34) indicate that prepro-orexin expression in LHA neurons is stimulated by profound hypoglycemia, suggesting that increased release of the appetite-stimulating orexin-A could contribute to hypoglycemia-induced hyperphagia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Interestingly, prepro-orexin expression does not increase if hypoglycemic rats either have free access to food (25) or are given a glucose infusion to maintain euglycemia (34).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Prepro-orexin expression also increased in rats fasted for 48 h, but not in others that were food-restricted for several days to produce weight loss comparable to 48 h of starvation or in several other conditions of increased hunger, including insulin-deficient diabetes and provision of a highly palatable diet (25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Here, we demonstrated that activation of orexin neurons was significantly increased 5 h after insulin injection in profoundly hypoglycemic rats that were not allowed to eat, whereas no such increases were found in hypoglycemic rats that were allowed free access to food.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These findings parallel our previous studies of prepro-orexin expression and support our suggestion that orexin neurons are stimulated by falling glucose and inhibited by feeding-related signals (25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Prandial signals in the hypoglycemic rats that ate could include the presence of food in the gut (e.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	162	, gastric stretch receptors) or increases in glucose or other nutrients in the hepatic portal circulation.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	163	However, it is not clear whether orexin neurons respond directly to changes in local glucose availability, as is the case for certain neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus and NTS (10,35), or whether modulating signals are relayed indirectly to the LHA (6).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	164	 One well-established indirect pathway is the projection ascending from the NTS, which receives input from visceral glucoreceptors and other vagal afferents (36).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The NTS contains neurons that are stimulated by falling glucose in the systemic or portal circulations and inhibited by rising systemic or portal glucose and by gastric distension (10,37); these neurons therefore have the potential to integrate various feeding-related signals.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	166	We found significantly increased numbers of activated orexin and nonorexin LHA neurons only in fasted hypoglycemic rats.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Neuronal activation in the LHA was accompanied by the appearance of Fos+ neurons in the NTS and adjacent DMNX; these responses were entirely absent in both the euglycemic controls and in the fed hypoglycemic rats.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The DMNX, intimately linked with the NTS, controls gut motility and the secretory responses that are particularly important in feeding behaviors (38).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The strikingly similar pattern in the NTS and LHA leads us to believe that the signals that triggered orexin neurons may be relayed via the NTS, which has a major projection to the LHA (8).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	170	Interestingly, orexin neurons accounted numerically for only about one-quarter of the additional number of LHA neurons activated in fasted hypoglycemic rats (Table 2).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The neurochemical identities of the other Fos+ neurons are not clear.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The activation of neurons in the ARC and PVN, both sites involved in regulation of feeding, suggests that some neurons from these areas may contribute to hypoglycemia-induced hyperphagia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Prolonged (24-h) fasting is known to activate neurons in these areas (39,40); however, the brief 5-h fast during the light phase (when the normoglycemic rats ate  < 1 g) was unlikely to have affected Fos expression per se in the hypoglycemic food-deprived group.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	174	 An obvious candidate is NPY, the most potent appetite-stimulating peptide known, which is produced in the ARC and released in sites including the PVN and LHA (32).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, hypothalamic NPY gene expression and NPY levels were not affected by hypoglycemia in rats allowed to eat (41,42), although NPY has not been reported in fasted hypoglycemic rats.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	176	 MCH, produced by a separate population of LHA neurons (32), stimulates feeding experimentally and may regulate energy homeostasis because MCH-deficient mice are hypophagic and lean (43).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	177	 MCH expression is increased by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but MCH neurons do not show Fos immunoreactivity during hypoglycemia (44).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	178	 There are extensive synaptic connections between NPY, proopiomelanocortin, MCH, and orexin neurons (22,45), and functional interactions among these may drive hyperphagia during hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	179	We found 14% of orexin neurons to be Fos+, a lower proportion than that reported by others (11).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This finding may reflect a difference in the time course of hypoglycemia or the methodology used to demonstrate and localize Fos immunoreactivity.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Using this dose of intermediate-acting insulin (which was selected for its consistent ability to stimulate feeding), plasma glucose dropped rapidly and remained low from 2 h after insulin administration; hypoglycemia was more profound in rats that were fasted throughout than in rats that were freely fed (25).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	182	 As with other immunohistochemical methods, our double-fluorescence technique may not be sensitive enough to detect all activated orexin neurons, although false-positive results are less likely using this approach.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The Fos method is widely used to identify and map neuronal activation across relatively large brain areas, but we acknowledge that it may miss neuronal activation via pathways other than Fos, as may be the case with MCH (11).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	184	We previously reported that prepro-orexin mRNA levels were increased twofold during 6 h of hypoglycemia with fasting the same conditions that activated orexin and other neurons in the LHA and neurons in the NTS/DMNX.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In this study, we found that whole hypothalamic concentrations of orexin-B were markedly raised by 10-fold above those for controls in the hypoglycemic fasted group; levels were unchanged in fed hypoglycemic rats, and orexin-A showed no changes in either hypoglycemic group.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The increase in orexin-B levels specifically accompanied the other indexes of orexin neuronal activation, but the magnitude of the rise and its dissociation from the unchanged orexin-A levels is difficult to explain or to relate to the physiological and behavioral effects of hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Increased prepro-orexin expression should equally increase the production of orexin-A and -B because both are derived from the common precursor.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Because orexin-A levels were not increased, it is possible that orexin-A release is enhanced in parallel with gene expression; increased synaptic availability of orexin-A would be predicted to stimulate feeding (13) and could contribute to the hyperphagia of hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The increase in orexin-B concentrations could be explained by a selective decrease in release, causing this peptide to accumulate within orexin neurons and terminals.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Orexin-B has little, if any, effect on feeding (16) and instead may act preferentially on the OX-2 receptor, which is concerned with arousal: a mutation in OX-2 causes narcolepsy in dogs (46), whereas orexin knockout in mice causes disturbed arousal-sleep patterns (47).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We therefore speculate that orexin-B release may be blocked in severe hypoglycemia, leading to its accumulation in the hypothalamus, and that this may contribute to the somnolence and ultimately coma induced by hypoglycemia.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	192	 This discrepancy between orexin-A and -B may indicate that orexin neurons are functionally heterogeneous and that one subpopulation may be involved in mediating feeding (via orexin-A release), whereas another (releasing orexin-B) may regulate sleep and arousal.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This explanation must remain speculative until orexin-A and -B release are measured separately in vivo in key hypothalamus regions and also in the locus coeruleus, which receives a dense orexinergic projection and controls the sleep-wake cycle (48).
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	194	In conclusion, we found striking activation of orexin and other LHA neurons in hypoglycemic rats that were not allowed to eat, but not if food was freely available.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Increased activation of orexin neurons was accompanied by the emergence of Fos+ neurons in the NTS and DMNX, indicating that the projection from the NTS to the LHA may be an important regulator of orexin neurons and their responses to changes in glucose availability and prandial signals.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These findings support our suggestions that orexin neurons are some of the glucose-sensitive neurons in the LHA and that they are regulated by visceral signals relayed via the NTS.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	197	 As such, they may be involved in triggering hunger and eating in response to hypoglycemia and perhaps in terminating feeding episodes.
0.20402655.11147774.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Orexins may be involved in various aspects of the hypothalamic responses to hypoglycemia, and their precise roles deserve further clarification.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Central administration of AgRP produces a robust increase in food intake, and this effect can be blocked by administration of nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Such results implicate opioid receptors as critical to mediating the effects of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	9	 To determine which opioid receptor subtype is critical, we first determined the highest i3vt (administered into the third ventricle) dose of two specific opioid antagonists, nor-Binaltorphine or ss-funaltrexamine, that did not influence food intake on their own.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Then, rats were pretreated with either of these two antagonists before i3vt AgRP and access to a high-fat diet.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For neither the - nor the  micro-specific antagonist was there any effect to block the effects of AgRP on food intake.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, administration of both the - and  micro-receptor antagonists does significantly reduce the effect of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The current results implicate opioid receptors as critical downstream mediators of the potent effects of AgRP to increase food intake but indicate that either  micro- or -receptor activation is sufficient for AgRP s effect.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	14	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE LINKS the central nervous system (CNS) melanocortin (MC) system to the control of food intake and body weight (1, 2).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The MCs are a family of peptides that include -, ss-, and -MSH and ACTH.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	16	 -MSH is an agonist at both the MC3 and 4 receptors, and central administration of -MSH or synthetic analogs, such as MTII, reduce food intake and body weight (3, 4).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A unique feature of the MC system is that, in addition to the well-documented role for endogenous agonists, there is also an important role for endogenous antagonists for the various MC receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The first antagonist described in the MC system was agouti signaling protein (ASP).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	19	 ASP acts in the periphery to alter MC1 receptor signaling to regulate peripheral skin and hair color (5).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Overexpression of ASP results in a yellow coat color via the MC1 receptor (6).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Overexpression of ASP also results in increased food intake and obesity via interaction with MC3 and 4 receptors in the CNS (4).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	22	Given that ASP is not normally found in the CNS, a role for ASP in regulating MC receptor signaling in the brain is unlikely.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, a homolog of ASP termed agouti-related protein (AgRP) is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in a population of neurons adjacent, but not overlapping, with neurons that produce -MSH (7, 8, 9).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	24	 AgRP acts as an antagonist at the MC3 and MC4 receptors (7, 10).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Hence, AgRP opposes the actions of -MSH.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Consistent with this, AgRP and the -MSH precursor, proopiomelanocortin, are regulated in opposite directions by energy balance and leptin.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Food deprivation decreases proopiomelanocortin gene expression, whereas it increases AgRP gene expression in the arcuate nucleus (11, 12, 13).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Overexpression of AgRP results in an obese phenotype similar to that of mice that overexpress ASP (10).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	29	When a biologically active fragment of AgRP is administered into the third ventricle (i3vt) of rats, the increase of food intake lasts for up to 6 d (14, 15).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although the short-term effects of AgRP seem to depend on antagonism at the identified MC receptors, the long-term effects do not (14).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, like neuropeptide Y (NPY), the orexigenic effect of AgRP can be blocked by the nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (16, 17).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, the potent effects of AgRP to increase food intake depend critically on activation of opioid receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Opioid receptors come in three identified subtypes:  micro, , and (18); and of these, both  micro and have been strongly implicated in the control of food intake (19).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus, the aim of these experiments was to assess the role of these specific opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP to increase food intake.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This paradigm was used because it produces very reliable 2-h intakes and because both AgRP and the ligands of the opioid receptors potently influence intake of a preferred HF diet more than other diets (24).

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We have previously reported that a subthreshold dose of the general opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, injected simultaneously with AgRP, could attenuate the acute hyperphagic effect without altering the unique long-term effects of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	150	 These results implicate opioid receptor activation in mediating the ability of AgRP to acutely increase food intake (17).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The current data extend those results in an interesting and not-anticipated way.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Unlike the results with naloxone, the highest subthreshold doses of either the  micro- or the -selective antagonist alone did not reduce the ability of AgRP to increase intake.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	153	 However, when  micro- and -antagonists were combined at doses that had no effect on food intake when administered without AgRP, they significantly attenuated the ability of AgRP to increase intake of the HF diet.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Like naloxone, this effect is associated only with the acute effects of AgRP, and combined  micro- and - receptor antagonism could not block the long-term effects of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	155	These data are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the acute effect of AgRP to increase food intake depends on activation of opioid receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	156	 However, these data also indicate that either  micro- or -opioid receptor activation is sufficient to mediate the effects of AgRP, such that only when both receptor subtypes are blocked does AgRP no longer activate critical aspects of CNS circuitry necessary to increase food intake acutely.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This result is potentially analogous to NPY, where suprathreshold doses of either - and  micro- (but not -) receptor antagonists reduce the orexigenic effect of NPY (25).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, in those experiments, it was not determined whether combined - and  micro-receptor blockade would further inhibit NPY-induced feeding.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	159	NPY and AgRP are largely colocalized within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (8, 9, 26), and mRNA for both is elevated after fasting and also in ob/ob and db/db mice (27).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Moreover, the acute effects of both NPY and AgRP are associated with recruitment of many of the same brain regions (28).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Consequently, the current data extend the similarity between NPY and AgRP to include recruiting the same opioid receptor subtypes.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	162	Several lines of evidence implicate the opioid system in the control of food intake (29).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Microinjection experiments have identified numerous sites, at every level of the neuroaxis, in which opioid agonist and antagonists affect food intake (for review, see Ref.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In particular, whereas opioid agonists and antagonists increase and decrease food intake, respectively, they also influence food choice.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Both - and  micro- selective antagonists have been found to decrease intake of an HF diet to a greater extent than they decrease intake of a high-carbohydrate diet (31).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Controversy exists, however, as to whether the effect of opioids is to alter the animal s choice of macronutrients or simply to drive the organism to consume more of an already preferred food (32).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Regardless of the interpretation, this is consistent with an important role for these opioid receptor subtypes in mediating the effects of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Similar to what occurs after manipulation of opioid receptor signaling, administration of AgRP selectively increases intake of a preferred HF diet (17).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Additionally, stimulation of  micro-receptors in the nucleus accumbens preferentially enhances HF feeding (33).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Such strong parallels between AgRP and opioid receptor ligands on food intake and food selection strengthen the hypothesis that these two systems interact in an important way to influence food intake and food choice.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	171	The opioid system encompasses a number of distributed receptor populations as well as a number of endogenous ligands for those receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In these experiments, the opioid receptor antagonists were delivered into the third ventricle and, hence, close to the hypothalamus.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, given the lipophyllic nature of these compounds and the rostral- to-caudal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system, it is likely that these antagonists could interact with opioid receptors in a variety of neuroanatomical sites (34).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Although these experiments, therefore, cannot determine the exact location of the critical  micro- and -opioid receptors, some clues can be derived from the areas that show increases in fos-like-immunoreactivity after third-ventricular administration of AgRP.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Two hours after AgRP administration, fos is increased in the accumbens shell, lateral septum, and paraventricular and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus.

0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	177	 All of these regions show evidence for  micro- or -receptor binding and/or expression, but only the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral hypothalamus show high levels of binding for both receptors (33, 36, 37).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Future research will need to address whether the activation of either  micro- or -receptor subtypes sufficient to produce AgRP s effects is in the same neuroanatomical sites or occurs as a result of activation in disparate sites.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	179	A separate (but related) question is which endogenous opioid ligand or ligands that are blocked by the specific receptor antagonists have increased release after AgRP administration.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The search for specific functions of opioid ligands has been hampered by the fact that they all interact with multiple subtypes of opioid receptors (20, 38) and the recent demonstration that opioid receptor subtypes can make heterodimers (39).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Nevertheless, both ss-endorphin and dynorphin have high affinity for both  micro- and -opioid receptors (40, 41, 42), and ss-endorphin is made in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (43), in cells that have been hypothesized to express the MC3 receptor (44, 45) and in the nucleus of the solitary tract in a region of high MC4 receptor expression.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus, it is possible that AgRP given into the third ventricle could exert direct effects on one or both of these ss-endorphin populations.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Food intake stimulated by ss- endorphin can be significantly and dose-dependently attenuated by pretreatment with either the  micro- or the -selective antagonists (46, 47).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (47), because the antagonists only worked at high equimolar doses, relative to ss-FNA, it is conceivable that they could be exerting their effects through multiple (rather than specific) opioid receptors.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Because none of the antagonist doses used in the Silva study completely eliminated the ss-endorphin-induced feeding, they proposed that, analogous to our findings with AgRP, blockade of multiple opioid receptors might be necessary to produce this effect.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Dynorphin is made both in the paraventricular nucleus and lateral area of the hypothalamus, and both regions express high levels of the MC4 receptor (48).
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Both our group and Berthoud and colleagues (35) have shown that the AgRP-induced fos in the lateral hypothalamus is colocalized with orexin-A immunoreactivity.
0.0967214.12399421.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Because dynorphin is heavily colocalized with orexin-A in the lateral hypothalamus (49), this provides direct evidence that AgRP can activate dynorphin-containing neurons.

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	168	The results of this study showed for the first time that a discrete population of orexin-ir neurons in the lateral hypothalamus projects to the ventrolateral medulla and phrenic nuclei.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These findings extend previous reports demonstrating that long descending orexin-containing axonal projections innervate the spinal cord (13, 24).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, our results suggest that direct synaptic contact between pre-Botzinger neurons and orexin-ir neurons are infrequent, despite the presence of numerous orexin-containing fibers in this region.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	171	Conceivably, the apparent projection of a subset of lateral hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons to pre-Botzinger neurons and to phrenic nuclei could be partly due to nonspecific labeling produced by some diffusion of retrograde tracer into the regions that contain nonrespiratory-related cells, and/or the uptake of tracer by descending fibers of orexin neurons that innervate the intermediate cell column or the thoracolumbar portion of the spinal cord (24).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In addition, CTB may also be taken up by fibers of passage.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, CTB continues to be regarded as a useful retrograde tracer in even the most recent neuroanatomic studies (11).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Furthermore, our results are in accord with other reports of transsynaptic transport of pseudorabies virus from the diaphragm to the lateral hypothalamus (18, 21, 27).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	175	Considerable numbers of orexin containing fibers were present within the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This finding is in accordance with recent data that orexin-containing neurons innervate vagal preganglionic cells within the nucleus ambiguus (12).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, we found little retrograde transport of CTB infused into this area to hypothalamic orexin-ir neurons, and CTB-labeled cells were mostly located medial to orexin-ir neurons.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Because CTB is taken up by synaptic vesicles, the possibility exists that synapses between pre-Botzinger complex neurons and orexinergic fibers of passage may be sparse.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	179	 It may be that orexin released from passing fibers nonsynaptically activates receptors or that orexin circulating within cerebrospinal fluid may activate neurons that contain orexin receptors (volume transmission), in analogy with the effects of endogenously released catecholamines in this region (2, 23).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Medullary neurons ventral to the compact portion of the nucleus ambiguus, which in our study also were immunoreactive for orexin A receptors, may belong to the external (loose) portion of the nucleus ambiguus.

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	189	 An increase in peak integrated moving average activity of the diaphragm without changes in respiratory timing indicates that these neurons are involved in the regulation of tidal volume activity of inspiratory pumping muscles, independent of frequency discharge.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	190	 However, these results do not exclude a critical role of inspiratory rhythm-generating cells of the pre-Botzinger complex for the control of respiratory timing (17).

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Furthermore, the activity of upper airway dilating muscles such as the genioglossus muscle could be affected via direct projections of orexin-containing neurons to hypoglossal motoneurons and activation of orexin-1 receptors expressed by hypoglossal motor cells that innervate that muscle (48).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In addition, dense orexinergic projections innervate the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord where the majority of sympathetic preganglionic neuronal cell bodies reside (13, 46).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	195	 This indicates that lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons may act directly on different brain stem and spinal cord cell groups, providing parallel control to cardiovascular and respiratory related output neurons during behavioral state control, defensive responses, and energy homeostasis (22, 42).

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Orexin given by these routes could activate multiple central nervous system and spinal orexin-sensitive sites, including excitatory brain stem neurons and spinal cord sympathetic preganglionic neurons (3, 10).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	199	 We observed no effects of medullary infusions of orexin on heart rate, possibly because our rats were vagotomized (12).

0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This assumption is consistent with recent findings indicating that orexin plays an important role in the maintenance of wakefulness (for reviews, see Refs.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	210	A decreased influence of orexin in brain regions that regulate sleep and breathing could cause simultaneous decreases in both arousal and respiratory drive.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Recently, it was reported that patients with sleep apnea had decreased blood levels of orexin, relative to controls (34).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The mechanisms that could produce a decreased production of orexin are unknown but may be related to the apparent link between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It is well known that obesity is the most prominent risk factor for sleep apnea (30, 56).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia also appear to provoke sleep apnea (47).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	215	 It seems likely that some metabolic alterations provoked by obesity, possibly elevations in circulating nutrient molecules, could partly explain the association between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	216	In genetic and diet-induced obesity in rodents, blood concentrations of a number of circulating molecules are elevated.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	217	 An increased effect of glucose, free-fatty acids, or leptin on hypothalamic function could provoke an altered activity of orexin-containing neurons (1, 4, 8, 20, 35, 36, 39, 51, 52, 54, 55).
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Thus orexin-containing neurons may be a key component in the connection between obesity and sleep apnea.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Further study will be required to investigate this hypothesis.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	220	In summary, hypothalamic orexin-containing neurons are part of a brain stem-spinal cord respiratory-related network.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Orexin, acting via orexin R1 expressed by pre-Botzinger neurons and the phrenic nuclei, increases respiratory drive.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	222	 This indicates that the orexin-orexin R1 pathway may play an important role in linking central nervous system nuclei involved in regulation of sleep-wakefulness states with the central nervous system control of respiration.
0.20187694.15557013.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Alterations in this regulatory system could lead to autonomic dysfunctions and sleep-related respiratory disorders.

0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers is a genetic disease occurring with a high prevalence worldwide and is unique to this breed.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Copper homeostasis appears to be well regulated in mammals.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Two copper carrier proteins have been identified in man and rodents which, when dysfunctional, cause either copper deficiency (Menkes disease) or copper accumulation in various tissues (Wilson disease).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, these proteins are not primarily involved in the biliary excretion of copper.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Bedlington terriers have a high prevalence of copper toxicosis and it is well documented that their biliary excretion of copper is impaired.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This disease is of direct relevance for the understanding of copper metabolism in mammals.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Previously, we mapped the copper toxicosis gene to dog chromosome region 10q26.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Based on DNA samples obtained from privately owned dogs, we were able to confine the localization of the copper toxicosis gene to a region of  < 500 kb by linkage disequilibrium mapping.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	14	 While screening genes and expressed sequence tags in this region for mutations we found that exon 2 of the MURR1 gene is deleted in both alleles of all affected Bedlington terriers and in single alleles in obligate carriers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although the function of the MURR1 gene is still unknown, the discovery of a mutated MURR1 gene in Bedlington terriers with copper toxicosis provides a new lead to disentangling the complexities of copper metabolism in mammals.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Naturally occurring canine genetic diseases have been useful models for the study of the pathophysiology, genetics and treatment of homologous diseases in humans (1).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In general, genetic diseases in dogs resemble human diseases more faithfully than their rodent counterparts.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This is not surprising given the closer evolutionary relationship and higher degree of DNA sequence identity between humans and dogs than between humans and rodents.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Dogs receive a high degree of medical scrutiny, nearly comparable to that applied in human medicine, and the same diagnostic procedures are used for humans and dogs.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The positional cloning of canine homologs of human disease genes has largely depended on the establishment and maintenance of breeding colonies (2 to 6).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, these captured diseases represent only a small portion of the available canine disease models that might be utilized to advance our knowledge of mammalian genetic diseases.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Purebred dogs, bred by dedicated dog breeders, offer a unique source of pedigrees to elucidate the molecular basis of simple and complex genetic diseases and traits.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The unusual and useful feature of dog breeds that makes them particularly amenable to genetic analysis is that each breed represents an isolated inbred population (7 to 9).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	24	Copper is one of the essential heavy metals in man s life, although it is highly toxic in excess of a certain threshold (10).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Therefore, a well regulated copper metabolism is required to ensure cellular copper homeostasis.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Yeast has been an indispensable model for understanding genes involved in eukaryotic copper metabolism and homeostasis.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Two copper carrier proteins have been identified in man and rodents which, when dysfunctional, cause either copper deficiency (Menkes disease, MIM 277900) or copper accumulation in various tissues (Wilson disease, MIM 309400).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Copper toxicosis (CT) in Bedlington terriers, first described by Hardy (11), is an autosomal recessive disorder (12,13).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It is characterized by inefficient excretion of copper via the bile (11), resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver, and leading to chronic hepatitis and, finally, cirrhosis (14).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	30	 An anonymous microsatellite marker, C04107 (15), was shown to be genetically very closely linked to the CT locus in Bedlington terriers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) has been observed between allele 2 of marker C04107 and the CT locus.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Although this marker has been available since 1995, the molecular basis of the disorder has not yet been reported.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	33	In 1999 we reported the localization of the CT locus to canine chromosome region CFA10q26 (16) a region homologous to human chromosome region HSA2p13 to 21.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This localization was able to rule out any candidate gene known at that time (16 to 18).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since the CT mutation has been present in the Bedlington terrier breed for at least 20 to 30 generations, we were recently able to refine the CT region by homozygosity mapping to a region of 42.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	36	3 cR3000 that corresponds to a region of 9 Mb (19).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	37	The purpose of this study was to isolate the CT gene by positional cloning.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We employed homozygosity and LD mapping to refine the CT candidate gene region even further, to a region of  < 500 kb.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	39	 A physical map of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) was constructed covering this region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Comparative mapping and sample sequencing was used to construct a transcription map of the region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Several genes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and putative transcripts were identified.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Mutation analysis revealed a genomic deletion in the MURR1 gene leading to a predicted truncated protein of 94 amino acids, which is conserved in mammals with a so far unknown function.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	43	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Homozygosity mapping In our previous study, by using homozygosity mapping, we showed that the CT locus was mapped between markers FH2523 and C10.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	44	602, recombinants were observed, indicating that the CT candidate region could be refined even further.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, at that time only one marker was present within this interval, namely C04107.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	46	 All affected Bedlington terriers included in our study were homozygous for allele 2 of marker C04107.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Therefore, the partial BAC contig covering the 4.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	48	6 cM CT region (described below) was used to isolate new polymorphic microsatellite markers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In addition, a new marker, DTR10.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	50	5, was reported in the literature (20).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These 11 new markers were subjected to our panel of Bedlington terriers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Haplotypes of the Belgian Bedlington terrier pedigree members were created using individual genotypes from the 14 polymorphic markers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In addition, genotypes were determined in 10 single Belgian Bedlington terriers, unrelated to the large Belgian pedigree, and in three English Bedlington terriers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Although the lack of additional family members for these dogs prohibited the construction of phase-known haplotypes, the majority of the haplotypes could be reconstructed easily because the animals shared homozygosity for the majority of the marker alleles of consecutive markers (Table 1).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In addition, haplotypes of some of the obligate carriers and unaffected dogs are shown for comparison (Table 1).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	56	 A complete list of haplotypes of all the 22 affected dogs, 14 obligate carriers and seven unaffected dogs can be found at http://humgen.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Haplotypes of a selected number of affected, obligate carriers and unaffected Bedlington terriers   The region that is homozygous in all affected Bedlington terriers only comprises markers CF10B17 and C04107 (Table 1); it is 300 kb and flanked by markers CF10B18 and CF10B19.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Although marker CF10B19 repeatedly showed a 2,3 genotype in Bedlington terrier UTB10, we cannot exclude that allele 3 is here the result of a mutation event instead of a recombination event.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Hence, we included CF10B19 as part of the CT candidate region and considered the region flanked by the markers CF10B18 and CF10B23 as the CT candidate region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This candidate region was completely covered by five BAC clones (Fig.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	61	 1), which cover a region of 500 kb.

0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	66	  Construction of a BAC contig covering the CT region Previously, the CT region had been confined to a 42.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	67	3 cR3000 interval, between the FH2523 and C10.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Based on a partial BAC contig that was constructed at that time, it was estimated that one cR3000 is equivalent to 210 kb, implying that the CT candidate region was 9 Mb.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This 9 Mb region was further saturated using EST clones and genes from the corresponding homologous region in the human genome (described below).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Canine BAC clones were isolated for many of these human genes and ESTs in order to have multiple starting points for the construction of a BAC contig covering the CT region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	71	 ESTs KIAA0903 (AB020710), KIAA0570 (AB011142), DKFZp586J101 (HSM800548), clone 24963 (AF131737) and the genes PEX13 (AB022192) and MHD1 (XM_049272) were used to help in constructing the BAC contig.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	72	 This resulted in three independent BAC contigs with minimum tiling paths of eight, 10 and 14 clones, estimated to cover some 3 Mb of DNA.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Fortunately, the sequence flanking the canine marker DTR10.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	74	5 was conserved in man and showed homology to one of the YAC clones covering the human 2p13 to p16 region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	75	 (Detailed information on the canine BAC and comparative human YAC contig can be found at http://humgen.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	76	The C04107 marker was initially isolated in BAC clone N21 to 27 (16).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Starting from this BAC clone a walk was initiated into both directions.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Marker FH2523, determining the most proximal boundary of the CT candidate region, was cloned in BAC J20 to 135, which was within four BAC clones from C04107.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The C04107 BAC contig consists of a minimum tiling path of nine BAC clones (Fig.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Since this contig contains both markers CF10B18 and CF10B23 it covers the entire CT candidate region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	81	 For the remainder of the results we will refer to this contig as the CT-contig.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	82	Comparative mapping and construction of a transcription map of the CT region It was anticipated that the completion of the human genome sequence would aid in constructing a transcription map of the candidate CT region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	83	 However, examining the NCBI (http://www.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	84	org/) databases revealed that the sequence information from the human 2p13 to p16 region was under-represented in the public databases (May 2001).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Nevertheless, more than 40 ESTs, genes or predicted transcripts were identified from the region between genes VRK2 (XM_002687) and MDH1 (XM_049272).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, every new update of the sequence showed large changes in comparison to the previous one with respect to the genes present.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Because of these large fluctuations, we decided to focus our attention primarily on those transcripts that could be mapped back onto our CT-contig by either PCR or Southern blot analysis.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	88	 A total of seven ESTs/genes from the human genome sequence could be localized onto the CT-contig, namely CRM1 (XM_002691), ys77h10.

0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	157	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We describe here the first example of exploiting one of the more than 300 isolated canine populations worldwide to discover a new gene (1).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	158	 When the gene we have identified is mutated, the Bedlington terrier is affected by CT; therefore, it is likely that the gene is involved in copper homeostasis in mammals.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	159	 CT in Bedlington terriers has long interested researchers because of its phenotypic similarities to human copper-related diseases, such as Wilson disease and Indian and non-Indian childhood cirrhosis.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The cloning of the Wilson disease gene, ATP7B, and the presence of a genetic marker linked to the CT locus in Bedlington terriers, allowed us to exclude the ATP7B gene as a candidate gene for CT based on map location (16).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Soon after, additional genes known to be involved in copper metabolism were also excluded as candidates for CT (16 to 18).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	162	Although the CT locus was linked to marker C04107, recombination events between the CT locus and marker C04107 (23,24) suggested that C04107 was still at a certain distance from the CT gene.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	163	 We have not identified a recombinant event in our cohort of CT-affected dogs, but we have nevertheless based our strategy on these observations.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We initially set out to refine the CT candidate region further by LD mapping in affected dogs, which would result in identical regions of homozygosity encompassing the CT locus.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although Ostrander and Kruglyak (9) advocated this approach, they also suggested that extensive inbreeding could result in rather large regions of LD, thereby hampering the fine mapping of a disease locus.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, since the CT mutation has existed in the Bedlington terrier breed for 20 to 30 generations, the regions of LD around the disease mutation that are shared between the Belgian and British Bedlington terriers should be fairly small.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Nevertheless, we were surprised to find that in our cohort of only 22 affected dogs most of which come from one Belgian pedigree the CT region could be refined to a region as small as 500 kb.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	168	The region that was shared in homozygous form by all the affected dogs was isolated in BAC clones.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The  conservative  CT-contig consisted of nine overlapping BAC clones; the region was further refined to 500 kb, flanked by the markers CF10B18 and CF10B23.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The 500 kb region is covered by five BAC clones.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A transcription map was generated from this region using a combination of human genome sequence data and sample sequencing of canine BAC clones.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The human sequence revealed six different transcripts; the combined approach revealed 16 putative transcripts in this region.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Since the identity of most of the transcripts from this region has not yet been determined, we focused our attention on the known genes.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	174	 One of these genes, MURR1, revealed a deletion of exon 2, resulting in an in-frame deletion and the production of a predicted truncated protein of 94 amino acid residues instead of 188 amino acid residues.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Southern blot analysis and PCR analysis using intronic primers clearly demonstrated the presence of a genomic deletion that spans at least 10 kb and encompasses exon 2.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	176	The presence of a deletion of exon 2 of the MURR1 gene in all affected Bedlington terriers in a homozygous state suggests that MURR1 is the disease-causing gene in CT in Bedlington terriers.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Interestingly, however, the C04107 marker is located within intron 1 of MURR1.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	178	 This would make C04107 an excellent predictive marker for CT especially, given the extensive LD between allele 2 of this marker and the CT locus.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Nevertheless, this localization of C04107 within the MURR1 gene also raises the intriguing question of how to explain the recombinants described previously.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	180	 It cannot be excluded that recombination between C04107 and the site of the deletion associated with CT can lead to an uncoupling between allele 2 of C04107 and the CT mutation.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, it would be interesting to test the recombinant dogs for the presence of the CT mutation.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Alternatively, different mutations may be present in the MURR1 gene and associated with different C04107 alleles, although it is very unlikely that several mutations would occur in a purebred dog.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, an incorrect diagnosis of the disease may also provide a logical explanation for the observed discrepancy.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In our cohort of Bedlington terriers, the CT affection status is determined by hepatic copper concentrations of 1000  microg/g dry weight of liver.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	185	 (24) considered dogs to be affected with CT when hepatic copper concentrations exceeded 400  microg/g dry weight of liver.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Normal liver copper concentrations in dogs vary widely and even in healthy dogs may exceed 400  microg/g dry weight of liver (25).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	187	 An extensive survey on a much larger panel of Bedlington terriers would resolve this issue.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	188	The large genomic deletion causing a truncated MURR1 protein of 94 amino acids suggests a loss-of-function mutation which would lead to the complete loss of protein function.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The function of the MURR1 protein remains to be elucidated since this protein is completely unknown and shows no homology with any other protein or identifiable motifs.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The MURR1 gene seems to be restricted to vertebrates and perhaps only to mammals because no detectable homologs are present in S.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In addition, the results of the structural and site predictions are too limited to indicate the putative function of the protein.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	192	We know that in affected Bedlington terriers copper is stored in the lysosomes due to an inefficient excretion of copper via the bile (26).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Recently, our knowledge about copper uptake into the cell and cellular copper transport into different proteins has increased substantially (10).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, knowledge about the cellular processes acting downstream of the Wilson disease protein ATP7B and involving copper excretion into the bile is limited.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It is known that ATP7B redistributes to vesicular structures and to apical vacuoles reminiscent of bile canaliculi at high copper levels (27).
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the accumulation of copper in the lysosomes is associated with a defect in the lysosomal vesicles transport to the bile canalicular membrane for excretion into the bile.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	197	 An 84% copper level reduction in the bile of affected Bedlington terriers is seen (H.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	198	Roelofsen, personal communication), confirming these speculations.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Although the exact role of MURR1 still needs to be elucidated, the ubiquitous expression pattern of the gene is consistent with a general function of the protein, such as vesicle transport.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The fact that most copper is retained in the liver (28), where copper is excreted out of the body, explains why other tissues of affected Bedlington terriers do not show any copper accumulation.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In addition, the high level of expression of MURR1 in the liver adds to the importance of MURR1 in copper excretion by the liver.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	202	The function of MURR1 in copper homeostasis in mammalian cells should be investigated in the future.
0.14836259.11809725.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Moreover, MURR1 becomes a good candidate gene for the human copper storage disorders that still need to be elucidated, including Indian childhood cirrhosis (29) and non-Indian childhood cirrhosis (30), as well as the copper toxicosis disorders seen in other dog breeds and in sheep (25,31).

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	4	Although it is clear that the orexin/hypocretin peptides have a significant, physiologically relevant role in sleep/wakefulness, a broader picture has emerged indicating metabolic actions that may depend upon both neural and endocrine mechanisms for their manifestation.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The ability of exogenous peptide to activate sympathetic tone, increase locomotor activity, and alter feeding behavior, together with the observed alterations in those functions in knockout animals, strongly suggests important neural actions of the endogenous orexins/hypocretins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Likewise, the action of exogenously administered peptides to alter endocrine function, in particular corticotropin release, has now been mirrored by potential endocrinopathies in knockout animals.

0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	10	A REMARKABLE CONVERGENCE of independent efforts occurred early in 1998, when the La Jolla and Dallas groups simultaneously reported the predicted (6) or elucidated (29) structures of two peptides that would become named the hypocretins (6) or, alternatively, the orexins (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These peptides, known to be processed from the same prohormone, were recognized to be produced in brain in a remarkably circumscribed location, the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area, a region known to be important in feeding behavior (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Axonal projections to multiple brain sites (4-6, 21, 25, 29, 38) predicted a diversity of biological actions, and it was clear from the beginning that the peptides exerted membrane effects similar to recognized neurotransmitters (6, 8, 42) and might have a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of feeding behavior (13, 29, 31).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For simplicity, these peptides will be referred to as the orexins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Orexin A (hypocretin-1) is a 33-amino acid peptide with two internal disulfide linkages, a pyroglutamyl residue in the NH2 terminus and an amidated COOH terminus.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Orexin B (hypocretin-2) is 28 amino acids in length, lacks internal disulfide bonds, but similarly has an amidated COOH terminus.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In their initial description of the orexins, Yanigisawa's group (Sakurai et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	17	 29) also identified the two orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although both are G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R appears to couple via the Gq/11 subclass of heteromeric receptors, and OX2R may couple through either the Gq/11 or the Gi/o subclasses (29, 42).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	19	 It is clear that OX1R prefers orexin A as a ligand, whereas OX2R binds orexin A or orexin B with similar affinities (29).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Finally, it should be recognized that, in addition to a broad projection field originating from the orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic/perifornical area, unique distributions of OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist (17, 19, 29, 41), establishing the potential for the development of pharmacological agents that interact uniquely at a single subclass of orexin receptor and therefore act as selective agonists or antagonists for specific biological actions of the endogenous peptides.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	21	    BIOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF THE OREXINS/HYPOCRETINS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION BIOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF THE.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	22	Although it is agreed that exogenously applied orexin can stimulate feeding and that orexin production is determined by the metabolic state of the animal (see review by Mieda and Yanagisawa, Ref.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	23	 20), most investigators recognize the effects of the orexins to be less potent than those of neuropeptide Y (NPY; see review by Smart et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, it must be recognized that multiple peptide systems interact to control the feeding response, and the hierarchy within those systems is not clearly established.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Pretreatment with NPY antagonists significantly decreased the feeding response to exogenously administered orexin (7, 44), suggesting that NPY neurons are located downstream in the "wiring" diagram; however, evidence does exist for a potential opposite to be true, i.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	26	, orexin neurons located farther downstream to NPY in a series circuit controlling feeding (22).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	27	 There is strong evidence for the innervation of NPY neurons by orexin terminals in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (5, 11), and central administration of a dose of orexin that stimulated feeding significantly increased NPY mRNA in that nuclear group as well (16).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Convincing evidence for a physiologically relevant role for the endogenous orexins in the CNS control of feeding comes from passive immunoneutralization studies, in which compromise of the bioactivity of endogenous orexin (22, 43) with neutralizing antibodies reduced feeding in response to an overnight fast.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	29	 At least one group, with access to the compound, observed decreased feeding in response to exogenously applied orexin or fast-induced feeding after administration of the relatively selective nonpeptide OX1R antagonist SB-334867 (27).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Orexin knockout mice (preprohormone gene deletion) ate less than wild-type littermates (2), again suggesting a physiologically relevant role for endogenous orexin in the regulation of appetite.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, these mice grew normally; thus some other determinant of growth or body weight must compensate for the decreased feeding.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	32	 There are two excellent possibilities: motor activity and metabolic state.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	33	Early on, it was recognized that orexins stimulated motor activity and apparently increased arousal state (8, 30).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The peptides also stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity (3, 30, 34, 36), and it was thought that the increase in feeding might actually have been secondary to the increased arousal state or metabolic demand (18).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It is clear that locomotor activity and time spent in the awake state increased in the animals administered orexin (8).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, in addition to stimulating feeding, these peptides stimulated energy expenditure (45).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Things became much clearer when Yanagisawa and colleagues (Chemelli et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	38	 2) once again demonstrated their technical expertise by developing an orexin gene knockout mouse.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This model proved the importance of the endogenous orexin system to sleep/wakefulness but at the same time cast doubt on the physiological relevance of the observed effects of the peptides on feeding behavior and metabolism.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These mice displayed a behavioral phenotype quite similar to human and canine models of narcolepsy (2, 15, 25), with distinct periods of behavioral arrest and the intrusion of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep into the normal waking state.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	41	 If the primary function of the orexins were to control feeding and metabolic rate, as the pharmacological studies had suggested, then these animals would have been expected to display phenotypic changes reflective of the loss of those activities.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, the mice were reported to be otherwise phenotypically normal, and their general metabolic state, as mirrored by serum electrolytes and glucose levels, was similar to that of the wild-type littermates at 14-15 wk of age.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In addition, the mice were fertile; thus the pharmacological effects previously reported on reproductive hormone (8, 26, 28, 39) and growth hormone (8) secretion did not appear to have a physiological expression in these animals at the times studied.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	44	    DEVELOPMENT OF THE OREXIN NEURON "DROPOUT MODEL" REVEALS THE POTENTIAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE OF ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC ACTION OF THE OREXINS/HYPOCRETINS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION BIOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF THE.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	45	Although the embryonic orexin gene knockout mice provided the key evidence that the pharmacological effects of orexin on sleep/wakefulness had potential physiological relevance and drew the attention of most investigators away from the endocrine and metabolic effects of the peptides, that model did not entirely recapitulate the pathology of human narcolepsy (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	46	 On the contrary, it had been recognized that human narcolepsy was in almost all cases not a frank lack of orexin gene expression throughout life, but instead a gradual loss of orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus with aging (24, 40).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Thus to faithfully recreate the mouse equivalent of the human model, Yanagisawa and colleagues (Hara et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	48	 9), in yet another brilliant series of experiments, created mice harboring the toxic ataxin-3 gene attached to the orexin promotor.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The ataxin-3 gene encodes a protein with extended polyglutamine repeats that caused apoptosis when expressed in transfected cells in vitro (46).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Already by 2 wk of age, the expression of the transgene could be detected in orexin-producing neurons, and by 4-8 wk of age, the majority of the orexin-producing neurons had been eliminated.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Similarly, by 8 wk of age in the ataxin-3-transgenic mice, no preproorexin mRNA could be detected, whereas the expression of two other peptides known to be involved in the control of feeding, NPY and melanin-concentrating hormone, appeared normal (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	52	By 6 wk of age, the orexin/ataxin-3 mice (9) were observed to display periods of behavioral arrest similar to those previously reported by these investigators in the orexin-knockout animals (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Fragmentation of sleep/wakefulness characteristic of the orexin-knockout animals was also observed in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This included increased frequency of entry into and duration of REM sleep.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Thus these mice, because of the delayed onset of compromise of orexin-producing neurons, more faithfully mirrored the situation in human narcolepsy, which is characterized by a slowly progressive disease due to the "dropping out" of orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (40).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	56	The appearance of the alterations in sleep/wakefulness in these mice was predictable; however, additional observations made by this group of investigators were not, and these surprises provide important insight into the potential endocrine and metabolic actions of the endogenous orexins.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	57	 One might have expected that, as these orexin/ataxin-3 mice aged, they would lose weight compared with wild-type controls due to the loss of the orexigenic action of the peptides.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Instead, even with a predicted decrease in food intake, they became obese (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The obese phenotype might have been due to the fact that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice displayed decreased spontaneous motor activity during the dark phase compared with controls, and thus their energy expenditure might possibly have been less, leading to obesity.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This would suggest that the ability of exogenous peptide to stimulate arousal and sympathetic nervous system and locomotor activity (3, 8, 30, 36) in the earlier pharmacological studies had physiological correlates.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	61	A most intriguing finding reported by Hara et al.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	62	 (9) was that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice developed, along with obesity, what appeared to be late-onset diabetes (type 2 diabetes).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Earlier work in the preproorexin gene knockout animals had not suggested any alterations in glucose homeostasis, and there are no reports of direct effects of orexin on insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets or -cells themselves.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	64	 There is one report that intravenous administration of orexin elevates circulating insulin and glucose levels in rats, and that orexin A stimulates insulin release in vitro from isolated, perfused pancreas preparations (23), but then only at doses higher than those present in the gland or the circulation.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The observed phenotype of obesity and diabetes in the orexin/ataxin-3 mice resembles the situation in some human narcoleptic patients (10, 35).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	66	 It also mirrors the situation in cortisol excess, in which the obesity is the result of a combination of fat redistribution, due to altered insulin sensitivity, and increased appetite.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	67	 It is our hypothesis that the orexin/ataxin-3 mice represent exactly the same pathology.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	68	Central administration of orexin in conscious rats resulted in a behavioral response similar to the stress response (8, 30).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This included increased grooming and motor activity (e.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	70	 These injections also resulted in increased sympathetic nervous system tone, reflected by increased heart rate and blood pressure (3, 30, 36).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	71	 It is not known whether the orexin/ataxin-3 mice display a "reset" or depressed autonomic system, and it will be important to examine that possibility.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Similarly, central administration of orexin stimulated corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone release (8, 12, 14, 34) in vivo, an action that was blocked by pretreatment of the animals with a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist (12, 34).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	73	 CRF is a recognized anorexigenic/anxiogenic peptide (8), and the loss of orexin neurons might predict not only a decrease in CRF release into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal vessels in response to stress but also the loss of a potential stimulatory action of orexin on CRF neurons important in the "shut-off" of feeding cues.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, in the absence of orexin, less CRF would be released under basal and stimulated conditions, and the animal, in addition to feeding for longer periods, would become corticosterone deficient.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Instead, quite the opposite was observed.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The animals ate less and appeared to experience corticosterone excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The decreased feeding observed clearly might be due to the loss of the orexigenic drive provided by the endogenous peptide, but what might explain the apparent corticosterone excess?.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	78	We have thought that the ability of centrally administered orexin to stimulate ACTH and corticosterone release in vivo (8, 12, 14, 34) was a reflection of a generalized stress effect of the exogenous peptide (30, 36) and not an indication of the role of endogenous orexin in the day-to-day control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Instead, we have identified direct anterior pituitary effects of the orexins/hypocretins (32) that potentially explain the metabolic phenotype of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Orexin-immunopositive nerve terminals exist in the external lamina of the median eminence (4), the site of diffusion of neuroendocrine factors into the hypophysial-portal vessels connecting the hypothalamus with the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In addition, both of the OX1R and OX2R subtypes exist in the anterior lobe, and the OX1R has been localized to corticotrophs in the human gland (1).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	82	 We have demonstrated the significant inhibitory effect of the orexins on CRF-stimulated ACTH release from cultured, anterior pituitary cells (32).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The effect appeared to be mediated by the OX1R subtype and a PKC-dependent mechanism, suggesting activation of a Gq-initiated signaling pathway (32).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	84	 More recently, we have demonstrated that orexin stimulated transient elevations in intracellular inositol trisphosphate levels (33), and Ferguson and Samson (A.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Samson, unpublished observations) have observed calcium transients in fura 2-labeled, CRF-responsive pituitary cells in vitro (A.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Samson, unpublished observations).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This would suggest that binding of orexin to the OX1R on corticotrophs results in activation of phospholipase C, with subsequent formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Because we have blocked the inhibitory action of orexin on CRF-induced ACTH release with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, we hypothesize that the formation of DAG results in the activation of a potassium channel, resulting in hyperpolarization of the corticotroph and a "right shift" in the CRF concentration-response curve.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This hypothesis is supported by our demonstration that pretreatment of the cells with a concentration of the potassium channel inhibitor glyburide, which by itself did not alter basal or CRF-stimulated hormone release, resulted in a complete reversal of the inhibitory effects of orexin (33).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	90	Thus we hypothesize that the more significant, physiologically relevant effect of orexin on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis is exerted at the pituitary and not the hypothalamic level.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The loss of a physiologically relevant, inhibitory effect of peptide over time as the orexin neurons degenerate would lead to increased sensitivity of the corticotrophs to CRF, with the resultant resetting of corticosteroid release and apparent corticosteroid excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This then might explain the appearance of diabetes to be in reality a situation of decreased insulin sensitivity caused by the corticosterone excess.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Certainly the obese appearance of these mice would support such a hypothesis.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	94	    CONCLUSIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION BIOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF THE.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	95	The absence of readily available, selective OX1R and OX2R antagonists and the inherent problems encountered with passive immunoneutralization approaches have resulted in slow progress toward the goal of establishing the physiological relevance of the described pharmacological actions of the orexins on endocrine systems and metabolism.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	96	 However, observations from the study of the preproorexin gene knockout mice suggested that several of the observed endocrine actions of pharmacologically administered orexin were, in all likelihood, without physiological correlate.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Those mice were fertile and apparently grew normally, with the exception that they had decreased activity and food intakes, in addition to the alterations in sleep/wakefulness.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Thus previously described effects of exogenous peptide on reproductive hormone and growth hormone secretion were not reflected in these knockout mice (2).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Metabolic alterations were recognized, however.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	100	 When animals expressing the orexin/ataxin-3 gene product were followed into adulthood, a clearer picture of the physiological relevance of the pharmacological effects of exogenously administered orexin began to appear.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These mice are narcoleptic and display decreased motor activity (9).
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In addition, they are obese and diabetic.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The model will certainly provide additional insight into the control of sleep/wakefulness, but even more importantly, it may provide information on the genesis of some forms of insulin-resistant diabetes, in particular those associated with excess corticosteroid production, e.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This may also stimulate clinical researchers to examine the possibility that a subset of human narcoleptic individuals are cushingoid.
0.358711.12485808.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Finally, these mice will provide a model in which to examine the unique, concordant actions of the peptides on feeding and energy utilization, which in the case of orexin, unlike those of other orexigenic peptides (9, 18), are positive for both food intake and energy expenditure.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Human centronuclear and myotubular myopathies belong to a genetically heterogeneous nosological group with clinical variability ranging from fatal disorder to mild weakness.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The severe X-linked form is attributed to more than 200 different mutations in the myotubularin encoding gene (MTM1).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, there are no reports regarding the molecular etiology or linkage studies on the autosomal forms of the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Labrador retrievers affected by spontaneous centronuclear myopathy (cnm) have clinical and histological features of the human disorder and represent the first model of recessive autosomal centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We previously mapped the cnm locus to the centromeric region of canine chromosome 2.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	10	 No gene of the MTM1 family maps to the human homologous chromosomal region.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Described herein is a disease-associated insertion within PTPLA exon 2, found in both alleles of all affected Labradors and in a single allele in obligate carriers.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The inserted tRNA-derived short interspersed repeat element (SINE) has a striking effect on the maturation of PTPLA mRNA, whereby it can be spliced out, partially exonized or involved in multiple exon-skipping.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	13	 As a result, the amount of wild-type transcripts falls to 1% in affected muscles.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This example therefore recapitulates cumulative SINE-associated transcriptional defects that have been previously described as exclusive consequences of independent mutations.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although the function of PTPLA in metazoa remains unknown, the characterization of a hypomorphic mutation in Labradors with centronuclear myopathy provides new clues about the molecular complexity of skeletal myofiber homeostasis.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These results also suggest that impaired PTPLA signaling might be implicated in human myopathies.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	18	 160150) is defined by heterogeneous forms of inherited muscular disorders that share common clinical and histological features.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Hallmarks of the disease include generalized muscle weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia externa, areflexia, muscular atrophy affecting predominantly type 1 myofibers, nuclei centralization and pale central zones with variably staining granules (1 to 3).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Genetic heterogeneity is correlated with the onset and severity of the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A significant proportion of infants affected by the severe X-linked form (called myotubular myopathy or XLMTM, OMIM no.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	25	 255200) run a milder course, the recessive form being intermediate between the X-linked and the dominant forms (2,6).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The XLMTM locus was initially mapped to Xq28 (7) and mutations in the Myotubularin (MTM1) gene were associated with the disease (8).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	27	 To date, a spectrum of 200 disease-associated mutations in MTM1 account for the very severe to mild phenotype observed in XLMTM patients (9).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	28	 MTM1 encodes myotubularin, which contains the consensus sequence for the tyrosine phosphatase catalytic site (8).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, this protein seems to essentially act in muscles as a phosphoinositide phosphatase, which specifically dephosphorylates the lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) (10 to 12) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns3,5P2) (13,14).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Myotubularin is the first identified member of a large protein family that comprises 13 other known members in human, named myotubularin-related 1 to 13 (MTMR1 to MTMR13).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Mutations in MTMR2 and MTMR13 have been associated with Charcot to Marie to Tooth demyelinating diseases (15 to 17) and reinforce a central role of phosphoinositides in neuromuscular homeostasis (reviewed in 18).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The MTM1 protein family encompasses both active and inactive members and recent reports have suggested functional cooperation between these two groups (18 to 23).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Besides the characterized etiology for XLMTM, no significant molecular data for the autosomal forms have been reported so far.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	34	Spontaneous cases of Labrador retrievers suffering from a congenital form of hereditary myopathy (hereditary myopathy of the Labrador retriever, HMLR) were first described in the USA in 1976 (24) and later on by other groups across the world (25 to 29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The myopathy is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disease (28 to 30).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Clinical features in male and female pups include hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, abnormal postures, stiff hopping gait, exercise intolerance and increased collapse when exposed to cold (see movie published as Supplementary Material at HMG Online).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	37	 On examination, there is evidence of skeletal muscle atrophy, particularly involving muscles of the head and tendinous areflexia.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Metabolic and shape remodeling of the muscles is observed with type 2 fibers deficiency and predominance of atrophic or hypertrophic type 1 fibers (24,25,28,29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In all reported cases, histopathological evaluation of muscle biopsies has demonstrated a characteristic centralization of myonuclei, often located in areas devoid of myofibrils with mitochondrial aggregation.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Centronuclear myopathy (cnm) was therefore proposed as an alternative name for the HMLR (29) and is, to our knowledge, the only spontaneous animal model for human autosomal centronuclear myopathies.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	41	We previously described our experimental pedigree of Labrador retrievers segregating centronuclear myopathy.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Furthermore, this transcription mainly led to abnormal transcripts with either premature stop codons or codons encoding a truncated protein.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Finally, transcription of the PTPLAalf allele also led to normal wt transcripts, although at a very low level ( < 1%).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	198	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Labrador retriever centronuclear myopathy perfectly mimics clinical and histological features of the human autosomal dominant and recessive forms of centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	199	 To date, neither genetic linkage nor molecular data are available for these two forms of the human disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To the best of our knowledge, canine centronuclear myopathy in Labrador retrievers is the only spontaneous animal model for the disease described so far.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We have previously mapped the canine cnm locus to a 18.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	202	1 cM interval within the centromeric region of CFA2.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Here, we report the identification of a canine gene, PTPLA, that likely plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of centronuclear myopathy seen in Labrador retrievers.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	204	 PTPLA has been shown to be expressed early in myogenic precursors during mouse embryogenesis (32) and afterwards in adult skeletal muscles of mouse (32) and human (33).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	205	In our experiments, PTPLA was expressed in canine skeletal muscles at all tested stages from birth to adulthood (data not shown).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	206	 This temporal expression pattern is compatible with the clinical and histological evolution of the disease in affected dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Furthermore, we observed a homozygous tRNA-like SINE insertion within PTPLA exon 2 of affected dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In the human genome, Alu elements are the most abundant SINEs and numerous Alu insertions into genes have been associated with hereditary disorders (36).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Not all of these cases have been demonstrated to be directly causative for the disease, but the lack of other detectable mutation and the rarity of such Alu insertions strongly suggest that they are a likely candidate.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In the case of the Labrador retriever centronuclear myopathy, two lines of reasoning suggest that the SINE exonic insertion is responsible for the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	211	 First, the SINE insertion identified in our pedigree of Labrador retriever perfectly segregates with the disease.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	212	 We have sampled 47 healthy dogs from 15 pure and mixed breeds and failed to detect this insertion.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In particular, the SINE insertion was not found in nine healthy French Labrador retrievers unrelated to our experimental pedigree.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The presence of the retroposed SINE within PTPLA is therefore highly correlated with the segregation of centronuclear myopathy in French Labrador retrievers.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Second, and most compellingly, we show that the repeat element insertion severely affects the splicing of the corresponding SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We provide strong evidence that the tRNA-like SINE is by itself responsible for cumulative transcriptional abnormalities based on the four following features: (i) the SINE can be properly spliced, although at a low level ( < 1%); (ii) partial exonization of the SINE; (iii) exon-skipping involving several exons and (iv) the total amount of PTPLA transcripts was markedly reduced.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Taken together, these observations show that the exonic SINE insertion within the PTPLA gene in cnm to / to  dogs acts as a hypomorphic mutation.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Existing data and ongoing experiments should help us to confirm that the SINE insertion within PTPLA is a causative event leading to canine centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	219	 First, our experimental pedigree has been established from two affected Labradors that are unrelated for 11 generations (29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	220	 We have found that both dogs are homozygotes for the same insertion within PTPLA exon 2.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Genotyping additional affected Labradors coming to the Alfort clinics will allow us to reinforce the association between the SINE insertion and cnm.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We also believe that close clinical and histopathological relationships exist between the centronuclear myopathy found in French Labrador retrievers and the HMLR identified in dogs from other countries (29).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although not precisely determined yet, the number of generations from common ancestors of affected Labradors from the USA and France is higher than between affected French dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Amplifying the SINE insertion in affected Labrador retrievers from the USA or from any other country will reinforce that the SINE insertion is the causative-disease mutation with founder effect.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Finally, characterization of mutations in PTPLA with similar phenotype either in transgenic mice or in human patients affected by autosomal recessive cnm would provide strong evidence that PTPLA plays a central role in the etiology of centronuclear myopathy.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	226	In human, the related X-linked myotubular myopathy has been attributed to truncating or missense mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin (8,9,44).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Classical and tissue-specific gene-targeting inactivation of Mtm1 in the mouse confirmed that the absence of muscular expression of Mtm1 does not affect myogenesis but induces lethal degeneration of skeletal muscles by 4 weeks of age (45).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Myotubularin is a phosphatase with dual activity that specifically dephosphorylates subpools of phosphatidylinositols (PIs) (10,11,13,14).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	229	 PIs are implicated in a number of physiological processes including cell proliferation, death, motility, cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular vesicle trafficking (46).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Ptpla was first annotated in mouse and then in human on the basis of a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase-like catalytic site, with a proline replacing arginine in the consensus (HCX26X2R) sequence (32,33).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	231	 PTPLA protein shares no sequence homology with the MTM1 protein family (data not shown) but, quite surprisingly, canine cnm-associated histopathological features closely resemble those observed in human and murine XLMTM.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Hence, PTPLA protein may be involved in the same PI-dependent functional signaling pathway as MTM1, at least in skeletal muscle.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This hypothesis should be addressed by testing the putative PTPLA phosphatase activity and/or investigating functional interactions between PTPLA and MTM1 proteins by analyzing, for example, the subcellular localization of MTM1 in the muscles of affected Labrador or the subcellular localization of PTPLA in the muscles of Mtm1 to / to  mice.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	234	In the work presented here, we show that the SINE insertion detected within PTPLA exon 2 is associated with various transcriptional features.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	235	 First, the SINE insertion is flanked by a direct duplication of the insertion site, which is characteristic of the retroposition mechanism of SINEs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	236	 As this duplicated sequence contains an AGGT tetranucleotide, the SINE acquired an uncommon intron-like status [5'-splicing donor site (GT) and 3'-splicing acceptor site (AG)] allowing its proper excision.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Although it generates complete and normal mature PTPLA transcripts, this mechanism seems to be poorly efficient as only 1% of wt PTPLA transcripts were detected in muscles of affected cnm to / to  Labradors compared with healthy cnm+/ to  dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Precise elimination of the SINE observed in vivo was reproduced ex vivo.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In addition to this exceptionally fine removal of parasitic sequence, the repeat element insertion has other deleterious consequences on the transcription of the SINE-containing PTPLAalf allele.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Indeed, we provide evidence that the splicing machinery recognizes cryptic splice sites within both the SINE and exon 2 sequences, which yields a mature elongated transcript containing a partially exonized SINE sequence.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Concomitantly, exon-skipping involving either exon 2 alone or in combination with other exons results in several PTPLA truncated transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Again, this PTPLAalf-associated aberrant exon-skipping could be undoubtedly attributed to the SINE sequence by itself as it was reproduced in ex vivo splicing experiments.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Alu insertions have been associated with other diseases (36 to 39,42,47).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	244	 These insertions were either associated with exonization of repeat element sequences or with specific exon-skipping.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Strikingly, the work presented here highlights that these two mutational mechanisms, previously reported as independent defects, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The systematic dichotomy observed between exonization and exon-skipping mechanisms may depend on splicing regulatory elements, either contained by the inserted Alu sequence or located in the genomic vicinity.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Alternatively, technical limitations might have prevented the identification of concomittant subtle transcriptional aberrations in previously reported studies.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Owing to the transcriptional defects associated with the SINE insertion in PTPLA, it is tempting to speculate that this repeat element contains splicing regulatory motifs that are strong enough to drive both exonization and exon-skipping.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Furthermore, SINE-associated exon-skipping previously reported only refer to skipping of a single exon.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	250	 For example, Alu insertion in exon 22 of human BCRA2 gene induces alternative skipping of this exon, which may play a role in the development of breast cancer (48).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Surprisingly, in Labradors affected by centronuclear myopathy, not only the SINE-targeted exon 2 but also exons 3, 4 and 5 are abnormally skipped in some muscular transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Introns 2 and 3 of canine PTPLA are 183 and 76 bp in length, respectively.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	253	 We may thus assume that the SINE hampers the spliceosome machinery to recognize normal consensus splicing sites by modifying spatial conformation of the transcripts and/or specific interaction of RNA with regulatory proteins.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Abnormal skipping of exons 3 and 4 would thus result from their closeness with the SINE.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Finally, all but one PTPLA abnormal transcripts bear a disruption of reading frame.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Princeps studies in yeast and human have paved the way for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance mechanism that eliminates transcripts containing premature termination codons (49,50).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The reduced total amount (35%) of PTPLA transcripts detected in muscles from cnm to / to  dogs using real-time RT to PCR analyses could therefore result from NMD leading to the degradation of PTPLA abnormal transcripts.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	258	Deleterious effects of repeat elements have already been reported in dogs.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	259	 For example, an intronic SINE insertion within the Hypocretin-receptor-2 in Doberman pinschers induces exon-skipping, leading to narcolepsy (51).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	260	 To date, relatively few canine diseases have been characterized at the genomic level.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	261	 With the examples of narcolepsy, hemophilia and centronuclear myopathy, diseases associated with insertion of repeat elements seem well represented.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The low average divergence of SINEC_Cf repeats in dogs and the high percentage of bimorphic loci with respect to the presence or absence of SINE insertion (6.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	263	5% between dogs of different breed) indicate that expansion of SINEs is a recent and still active process (52; Ewen Kirkness, personal communication).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The high incidence of disease-associated insertions in dogs may then be explained by the recent expansion of repeat sequences, which represent 31% of the canine genome (52).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	265	 By comparison, finding 406 gross insertion and duplication mutations in the Human Genetic Mutation Database that contains 44 090 characterized human mutations suggests that Alu insertions, which occur at a lower rate, hardly contribute to 0.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Besides their deleterious consequences on gene expression, insertions of SINEs in dogs and their observed bimorphism may contribute to interbreed or intrabreed modulation in gene expression accompanying physiological phenotypic diversity (52).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The functional effects of PTPLA mutation reported in the present paper disclose a rare example of a single SINE insertion with several modifications of RNA processing, which provides a molecular basis for the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of gene control by mobile elements (reviewed in 53).
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	268	In conclusion, the work presented here shows that the exonic SINE insertion within the PTPLA gene in cnm to / to  dogs acts as a hypomorphic mutation and recapitulates most of the SINE-dependent mutational molecular mechanisms.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	269	 These results also illustrate the relevance of the canine model in genetic studies.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Indeed, major advances in the development of canine genomic and genetic resources have been reported recently or will be soon available: (i) an integrated 4249 marker FISH/RH map (31); (ii) the publication of the 1.
0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	271	5x Poodle genome (52); (iii) the partial annotation of a 7.

0.16537316.15829503.html.plaintext.txt	273	 These resources will provide long-awaited means for mapping genes underlying the striking diversity among breeds in morphology and behavior as well as canine disease genes.

0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The hypothalamus is a key feeding center within the central nervous system (CNS), and many hypothalamic neuropeptides, such as NPY and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), play a pivotal role in the regulation of food intake (1).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Due to the intricate network of neuropeptide signaling pathways involved, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure are not completely understood.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	15	NPY is the most potent endogenous stimulator of feeding known, with the intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of nanomole quantities eliciting eating in satiated rats (2).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, chronic administration of NPY causes hyperphagia and an increase in body weight, resulting in obesity (3).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	17	 NPY mRNA is markedly increased in the hypothalamus of genetically obese animals (4).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, the factors regulating this potent feeding stimulator may have important implications in the therapeutic management of obesity.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	19	NPY-containing fibers are widely distributed throughout the CNS, and within the hypothalamus NPY is particularly abundant in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (5), an area important in the control of eating behavior that receives a dense NPY-containing projection from the arcuate nucleus (6).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Studies in vivo have demonstrated that NPY release in the PVN is strongly associated with increased appetite (7), and central administration of NPY increases c-fos expression in this region (8).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	21	NPY exerts effects through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), of which five subtypes have been cloned (9).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	22	 NPY Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors are expressed in hypothalamic areas implicated in the feeding actions of NPY (10).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Early studies showed the Y1-agonist [Leu31,Pro34]NPY stimulates food intake (11), whereas a Y1-selective antagonist reduces food intake evoked by both NPY and food deprivation (12).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The more recently characterized Y5 receptor is also implicated in feeding behavior, as the Y5-selective agonist PYY-(3 to 36), stimulates feeding in rats (13).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	25	 More modest effects on food intake were observed in response to stimulation of the Y2-receptor by the Y2 selective agonist NPY-(13 to 36) (14).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	26	The NPY knockout mouse, however, has been shown to have a normal body weight and a normal hyperphagic response to fasting (15), suggesting that other neuropeptides are able to compensate for this loss.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	27	 As previously noted there are many hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in feeding.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Of particular interest to the current study is the orexigenic neuropeptide MCH, which was first noted for its ability to induce melanosome aggregation in teleost fish, thus antagonizing the melanin-dispersing action of MSH (16).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	29	 MCH was isolated from the rat hypothalamus (17) and identified as a cyclic 19-amino acid neuropeptide in both human and rat (18).

0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The LHA is another nucleus within the hypothalamus that is important in the regulation of feeding, and lesions to this area result in profound hypophagia (22).

0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	36	Several observations pointed to a role for MCH in stimulating feeding, including antagonistic effects on the actions of MSH, a potent anorexigenic peptide (24), and elevated levels of MCH mRNA in the hypothalamus of genetically obese ob/ob mice (25).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Low doses of MCH administered icv stimulate feeding (25, 26).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Furthermore, MCH mRNA was increased by fasting in both normal and obese animals (25).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Recently, mice carrying a targeted deletion of the MCH gene were reported to have reduced body weight and hypoadiposity due to hypophagia and an inappropriately increased metabolic rate (27).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Hence, MCH appears to play a pivotal role in the stimulation of appetite.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	41	Controversy surrounding the nature of the receptor responsible for the actions of MCH was recently resolved with the demonstration that the somatostatin-like receptor-1 (SLC-1), an orphan GPCR, is a specific MCH receptor (28).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Consistent with the wide distribution of MCH-ir terminals in the CNS, SLC-1 mRNA and protein were located in the rat cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampal formation, amygdala, hypothalamus, and thalamus (29).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Binding studies show a similar distribution of MCH-binding sites in the human brain, with the highest concentration in the hypothalamus (30).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	44	Both NPY- and MCH-containing fibers project to areas of the hypothalamus that regulate appetite.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Although the orexigenic peptides NPY and MCH operate in regionally discrete pathways, recent anatomical studies provide evidence for a link between them.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Reciprocal projections exist between the arcuate nucleus and the LHA (31), and NPY-ir fibers were shown to directly innervate MCH fibers in the LHA (32).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The observation that the feeding effects of the LHA peptide orexin were influenced by an antagonist to NPY (33) further suggests that important interactions may arise between different orexigenic peptides in these regions.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	48	 However, the extent to which NPY and MCH interact to regulate feeding remains unclear.

0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	164	Activation of the Y1-receptor by MCH To test the hypothesis that MCH can stimulate feeding by directly activating the Y1-receptor, the effect of MCH was examined in a well characterized Y1-receptor system, the rat mesenteric artery.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Mesenteric artery tone was examined using a Mulvaney myograph as previously described (36).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In four experiments, constrictor responses to [Leu31,Pro34]NPY were evaluated over a concentration range of 10-10 to 10-6 M.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Robust constrictor responses to [Leu31,Pro34]NPY were observed, resulting in an EC50 value of 8.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	168	1, and BIBO 3304 inhibited this constrictor activity in a dose-dependent manner.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	169	 However, no evidence of constrictor activity in response to MCH from 3 x 10-9 to 3 x 10-5 M was found in vessels from the same animals.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Moreover, in the presence of 10-5 M MCH, [Leu31,Pro34]NPY was still able to elicit a normal constrictor response.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	171	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The results of this study confirm the previously reported orexigenic actions of both NPY and MCH (2, 25, 26).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although both peptides stimulated food intake, the lower feeding response to a near-maximal dose of MCH (26) demonstrates that NPY is the more potent appetite stimulant.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This study aimed to investigate a possible interaction between these two peptides on feeding.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Immunohistochemical studies show reciprocal connections between NPY- and MCH-containing fibers of the arcuate nucleus and the LHA, and these fibers both project to areas of the hypothalamus implicated in feeding (31, 32).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Recent reports confirm that MCH activates a receptor distinct from those through which NPY is known to mediate its feeding effects (28).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	176	 We investigated a possible interaction between these two orexigenic peptides by assessing the effects of Y1-receptor blockade on the stimulation of food intake induced by MCH.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	177	The present study has shown, for the first time, that food intake induced by MCH is significantly inhibited by BIBO 3304.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	178	 BIBO 3304 is a recently available synthetic nonpeptide molecule that competes with high affinity (IC50, 0.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	179	2 nM) for the rat Y1-receptor and displays micromolar affinity for the Y2-, Y4-, and Y5-receptors (37).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	180	 These results suggest that the feeding response elicited by MCH is mediated in part through activation of the Y1-receptor.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This could be achieved via an indirect mechanism by which MCH causes NPY release and thus stimulates food intake, or perhaps through a direct activation of the Y1-receptor by MCH itself (see Fig.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	182	 As reported previously after PVN administration (38), in this study icv BIBO 3304 significantly inhibited the feeding induced by central administration of NPY.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	183	 We also demonstrated that the administration of BIBO 3304 alone did not affect daytime feeding relative to vehicle.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Therefore, it is unlikely that the reduction in MCH-induced food intake was due to nonspecific side-effects of BIBO 3304.

0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Top, MCH can increase feeding by causing release of NPY, the effect of which can be blocked by Y1 antagonists.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Middle, MCH may stimulate feeding by acting as a Y1 agonist.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Note, however, that our observations from the mesenteric artery do not support this possibility.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Alternatively, MCH may activate SLC-1 receptors on Y1-receptor-expressing neurons, altering neuronal responsivity (not shown).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Bottom, Y1 antagonists might block the MCH receptor, SLC-1.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	192	  Consistent with the inhibition of MCH-induced feeding by BIBO 3304, the structurally distinct Y1-selective peptide antagonist GR231118 was also able to inhibit food intake induced by MCH.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Reports show that GR231118 binds with high affinity (Ki = 0.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	194	16 nM) to the rat Y1-receptor (39) and autoradiographic studies demonstrate that [125I]GR231118 binding is fully inhibited by BIBO 3304 in most areas of the rat brain (40).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The present study confirms that at the dose administered, GR231118 significantly inhibits NPY-induced food intake.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Apart from the observed inhibition of NPY-induced feeding by Y1-antagonists (12, 38, 39, 41), the earlier observation that the Y1-selective analog [Leu31,Pro34]NPY stimulated feeding pointed to a role for the Y1 receptor in mediating NPY-induced food intake (11, 41, 42).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Although it has been argued more recently that [Leu31,Pro34]NPY also activates the Y5 receptor to stimulate feeding (13), the extent of inhibition of feeding we observed in the presence of two different Y1 receptor antagonists confirms the importance of this receptor in mediating the feeding effects of NPY.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Other studies have shown that food intake induced by icv administration of NPY is remarkably reduced in the Y1 knockout, but preserved in the Y5 knockout, mouse (43).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Although GR231118 is also an agonist at the human NPY Y4-receptor (35), there are comparatively low levels of Y4-receptor expression in areas known to stimulate food intake in the rat (10); thus, it is unlikely that any Y4 effects contributed to the responses we observed.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Moreover, previous work by our group and others has shown that the administration of GR231118 does not stimulate food intake (12, 41).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Taken together, the actions of GR231118 in this feeding paradigm appear to be a Y1-mediated effect.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	202	The extent of inhibition of MCH-induced food intake by both BIBO 3304 and GR231118 was similar, with 73% and 86% inhibition at 2 h, respectively.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The slight difference in the degree of inhibition by the two antagonists may arise from variation between the two groups of animals used.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Although the administration of a higher dose of BIBO 3304 (40 nmol) was investigated, the presence of adverse reactions precluded further investigation.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The time course of the inhibitory effects of BIBO 3304 and GR231118 on MCH was similar, with a more marked effect over the first 2 h.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	206	This study also investigated the effects of coadministration of NPY and MCH on food intake.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	207	 If these agonists stimulate feeding through independent mechanisms operating in parallel, one might have expected an additive effect of the food intake achieved in response to each agonist alone.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	208	 However, coadministration of NPY and MCH did not increase food intake above that achieved by NPY alone.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These results may not be surprising if the dose of NPY approached that maximally effective in stimulating food intake.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The doses of NPY and MCH chosen gave very reproducible effects, and we know from parallel studies using NPY and a different mediator (Hansen, M.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Morris, unpublished observations) that it is possible to elicit 9 to 10 g food intake under identical conditions.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Therefore, we believe that if these mediators were acting in an entirely independent manner, a larger response would have been observed.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Further work is needed to test this, particularly the effect of BIBO 3304 on feeding responses to lower doses of NPY and MCH coadministration.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	214	 In support of an interaction, our results demonstrating that 20 nmol BIBO 3304 was less able to inhibit food intake in response to the combination of agonists than to NPY alone suggest that antagonism of the Y1-receptor is less effective in the presence of MCH.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This may arise due to competition by MCH at the Y1-receptor.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Alternatively, MCH may stimulate NPY release, leading to an increased amount of NPY at the Y1-receptor.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	217	 This possibility could be tested using techniques to measure in vivo NPY release.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Finally, the relatively weaker antagonism of agonist-induced feeding by BIBO 3304 in the presence of both MCH and NPY may reflect the summation of non-Y1-receptor-mediated effects of both agonists (via Y5-receptor/SLC-1 receptor).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	219	The fact that two selective Y1-receptor antagonists are able to block feeding induced by MCH also suggests that MCH may act in part directly at the Y1-receptor.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Another possibility is that MCH may act via SLC-1 receptors on Y1-receptor-expressing neurons, altering neuronal responsivity.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	221	 To our knowledge, the ability of MCH to bind the Y1-receptor has not been previously examined; however, the observed lack of constrictor activity of MCH in a well characterized Y1-receptor model in mesenteric blood vessels suggests that this is unlikely to be the case.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We found no response to MCH in mesenteric arteries that contracted to [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, nor did MCH affect the ability of [Leu31,Pro34]NPY to cause contraction, suggesting that MCH does not compete at the Y1-receptor, at least in this preparation.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	223	 If MCH does activate the Y1-receptor, it might be expected that the feeding response to MCH in the Y1 knockout would be attenuated.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The Y5-receptor may make some contribution to the feeding action of MCH, but this question was not examined in the present study.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The possibility that SLC-1 might be another NPY receptor appears unlikely, as the peptides screened for identification of the cognate ligand for SLC-1 were obtained from whole rat brain extracts, and only MCH and a truncated version of MCH yielded high agonist activity (44).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	226	 An SLC-1 receptor antagonist would further help to characterize the mechanism of action of MCH.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	227	MCH displays nanomolar affinity for its receptor, SLC-1 (28).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	228	 As MCH-induced food intake is inhibited by two Y1-receptor antagonists, the possibility that MCH acts via its receptor to cause NPY release and thereby stimulate food intake seems quite feasible.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The anatomical distribution of fibers further supports this hypothesis.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	230	 MCH-ir fibers, SLC-1 mRNA, and immunoreactivity are found in hypothalamic areas that are implicated in NPY-induced feeding, including the PVN (29, 31).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	231	 MCH-ir terminals are also found in the arcuate nucleus (31), a site of a major arcuo-PVN NPY-ergic projection.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The site of any putative MCH-induced NPY release cannot be determined from the results of this study using exogenous icv administration of these orexigenic peptides.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	233	From the results of the present study, we cannot exclude the possibility that GR231118 and BIBO 3304 are both antagonists at the SLC-1 receptor (Fig.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	234	 5), although the similar degree of inhibition of NPY and MCH effects observed by these well characterized molecules support a Y1 receptor mechanism.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Interestingly, recent reports detail the existence of a second GPCR for MCH, MCH-R2 (45, 46), in areas implicated in the regulation of body weight (46).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	236	The role of MCH in the regulation of food intake and its influence on other feeding mediators is particularly intriguing, as cell-specific lesions to the LHA produce hypophagia (23, 47).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	237	 MCH cell bodies are localized in the LHA, and in separate, but spatially overlapping, cell bodies within the LHA are the orexins, newly recognized peptides that also stimulate food intake upon icv administration (48).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The feeding effects of orexin were recently shown to involve NPY receptors, suggesting an interaction between these two mediators (33).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Targeted deletion of the MCH gene results in decreased food intake and body weight (27), closely resembling the phenotype of rats with LHA lesions, whereas targeted deletion of the orexin gene induces narcolepsy (49).
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The recent observation that transgenic mice that overexpress MCH are hyperphagic and display an obese phenotype (50) confirms the fundamental role MCH plays in the regulation of food intake.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	241	This study demonstrates that two structurally distinct, Y1-selective antagonists are able to significantly inhibit the feeding response evoked by MCH.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	242	 With the overlapping distribution of MCH- and NPY-containing fibers and receptors, this new evidence supports the hypothesis that the responses of these two important orexigenic peptides are integrated.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Although it is generally considered that arcuate NPY cells may make contact with LHA MCH-ir neurons (23), leading to MCH release, one interpretation of our finding is that MCH may elicit hyperphagia in part by stimulating NPY release subsequent to activation of the SLC-1 receptor.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	244	 It is also possible that MCH is able to stimulate food intake by directly acting at the Y1-receptor, although our in vitro findings do not support this possibility.
0.17783286.11751609.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Although further work is needed to delineate the mechanism by which MCH may interact with NPY to stimulate food intake, the present study provides evidence that the feeding response elicited by MCH is mediated through activation of the NPY Y1-receptor, probably by regulating NPY release.

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A stimulated food intake in a dose-dependent manner in young rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, no effects were observed at any dose in old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The protein level of OX1R in the hypothalamus was significantly lower in old rats than in young rats, although the protein level of OX2R was comparable between groups.

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The decline of food intake that often happens in healthy elderly persons predisposes them to pathological weight loss and protein-energy malnutrition, thereby raising morbidity or mortality.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The reasons for the decline in food intake are multifactorial.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Although the sensitivity to CCK, a classic neuropeptide that shows a satiety effect, is enhanced in old animals (21), the mechanism underlying this effect has not been elucidated (12).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	20	Orexins, which are appetite-stimulating peptides, were discovered in 1998 (18).

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	24	Orexins are expressed almost exclusively in the lateral hypothalamic area (18), a region classically implicated in the control of mammalian feeding behavior (19).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	25	 When administered centrally to rats, these peptides stimulate food consumption dose dependently (18).

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings suggested that the orexin neuropeptide system plays a significant role in feeding behavior, and orexins are therefore categorized as orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) factors.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, we have reported (13) that orexin-A stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion via the vagal efferent nerves and that orexin-A may be an important candidate as a mediator of the cephalic phase of the secretory response to feeding.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	29	In the present study, to determine the mechanism of the age-associated decrease in appetite and food intake, we compared food intake between young and old male rats as an indication of the stimulatory effect of intracerebroventricular administration of orexins.

0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	152	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   The present study showed that intracerebroventricular injection of orexin-A (3 nmol) stimulated food intake in a dose-dependent manner in young rats as previously reported (4, 18, 20, 22).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	153	 However, no effect was observed in old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	154	 To distinguish whether old rats have no response to orexin-A or have a blunted orexin-A response, the effect of a 10-fold higher dose (30 nmol) of orexin-A was determined in old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Again, no stimulation was observed.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Therefore, it is concluded that old rats have a true insensitivity to the feeding effect of orexin-A.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	157	To examine the mechanism underlying the effect of orexin-A, we measured the protein levels of its receptor in the hypothalamus and compared those levels between young and old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The protein level of OX1R was significantly lower in the old rats than in the young.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The band intensity of old rats was 45% less than that of young rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This result indicates that the decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for the lack of an orexin-A stimulatory effect on food intake in old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, we cannot answer the question of why an 50% reduction in the protein level of OX1R would yield a 100% reduction in behavioral response.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Because several neural pathways are involved in the orexigenic action of orexins (16), the aging change of these pathways might be implicated.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	163	Another hypothesis is that the age-related decrease in food intake by orexin-A is a secondary phenomenon due to the decline in the ability of orexin to increase arousal.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This problem has been discussed in previous reports (16, 22, 24), although we did not record the awakening time in the present study.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	165	 (16) reported that changes in food intake are independent of changes in sleep/wake cycles.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Moreover, a selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 reduced orexin-A-induced food intake (4).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Previously, abnormality of OX2R is shown to be a cause of canine narcolepsy (7).
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Because OX2R expression did not decrease with age in our study, the decrease in food intake in old rats does not seem to depend on the level of arousal.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	169	A previous study (6) reported that the central administration of orexins stimulated water intake significantly.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, we observed that the two higher doses of orexin-A did not significantly increase water intake even in young rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The differences between the study by Kunii et al.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	172	 (6) and our present study were the different doses of orexin-A applied and the experimental conditions.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	173	 (6) determined the effects of 3- to 30-nmol orexins, whereas we used 0.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	174	25 to 3 nmol; also, they measured water intake without feeding, whereas we measured water and food consumptions simultaneously.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	175	A recent study (17) reported that preproorexin gene expression and contents of orexins in the rat brain decreased in the course of aging.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There is also a report (25) that a site-specific decrease in immunostaining for orexin was observed in the locus coeruleus of old cats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These reports indicate deterioration of the orexin system in old animals.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	178	 We did not measure the orexin-A content in the brain, so whether or not that content decreased with age remains unknown.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, because orexin-A can bind to both OX1R and OX2R and the specificity of OX1R for orexin-A is high (18), the age-associated change in OX1R could be biologically more important than that in orexin-A.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Our observation leads us to propose that the age-associated decline in OX1R may be related to the age-associated decline in appetite and food intake.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	181	On the other hand, orexin-B showed no significant effect in either young or old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The present observation is compatible with the previous studies (2, 8) in that central orexin-B is a less effective stimulant of food intake than orexin-A.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The protein level of OX2R was not significantly different between young and old rats.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (23) measured mRNA levels of OX1R and OX2R in eight brain regions of 3-, 12-, 18-, and 24-mo-old C57BL/6 mice.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	185	 They observed a declining trend of the OX2R mRNA level in the hypothalamus, although there is no age-related change in OX1R mRNA expression.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These differences might be due to the species difference, although the precise mechanism is unknown.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	187	In conclusion, the function of the orexin system in stimulating feeding behavior was reduced in old rats compared with young ones.
0.16720255.15271651.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The decrease in the OX1R protein level in the hypothalamus could be responsible for orexin-A's lack of stimulatory effect on food intake in old rats.

0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In addition, we identified a functional interaction between ghrelin and orexins.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Icv administration of ghrelin stimulates both GH secretion and food intake (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9); ghrelin-induced feeding is thought to occur independently of GH, as icv administered ghrelin also increased food intake in spontaneous GH-deficient rats (6, 7).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Ghrelin stimulates feeding through NPY and AgRP (6, 7), orexigenic peptides colocalized in neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (34).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Ghrelin receptor mRNA is expressed in NPY/AgRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus (35).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Centrally administered ghrelin induced Fos expression in approximately 40% of NPY/AgRP neurons (7) and increased NPY and AgRP mRNA levels (5, 6, 7, 24).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	173	Ghrelin receptor mRNA is also present in the LH of rats (21), a region implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Animals with LH lesions exhibit decreased food intake (36, 37), whereas electrical stimulation of the LH during a satiated state promotes feeding (37, 38).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Orexin and MCH are orexigenic neuropeptides synthesized specifically in the LH (22, 25, 26, 27, 32, 39, 40).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Ghrelin fibers project to the LH to synapse on orexin-immunoreactive neurons.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Icv administration of ghrelin induced Fos expression in orexin-expressing neurons but not in MCH-expressing neurons; this result is consistent with a recent finding that icv administration of GHRP-6, a synthetic GH-releasing hexapeptide that binds to the ghrelin receptor (41), induced Fos in a similar neuronal pattern (9).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These findings indicate that ghrelin may stimulate feeding through both the orexin system and the NPY and AgRP systems.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	179	Several peptidergic and monoaminergic systems that participate in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus link through neuronal circuits.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	180	 NPY fibers directly project to orexin neurons (42, 43); icv injection of anti-orexin antiserum before NPY injection significantly attenuated NPY-induced feeding (44), indicating that NPY interacts with orexin both anatomically and functionally.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	181	 As ghrelin induces feeding through activation of the NPY system, we sought to investigate the activation of orexin-producing neurons by ghrelin via the NPY system.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	182	 We therefore examined ghrelin-induced Fos expression in orexin-producing neurons following pretreatment with anti-NPY IgG.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Ghrelin remained competent to induce Fos expression in orexin-producing neurons following pretreatment with anti-NPY IgG, suggesting that ghrelin activates orexin-producing neurons in a manner independent of NPY.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	184	Orexin regulates not only feeding and energy homeostasis but also sleep-wakefulness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic functions (25, 29, 40, 45, 46).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Ghrelin induced Fos expression in approximately 23% of orexin-immunoreactive neurons.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	186	 As 33% of orexin-immunoreactive neurons are glucosensitive (47) and a subset of these neurons express the receptor for leptin (42), a satiation signal produced in the adipocytes, a part of orexin-expressing neurons may play a crucial role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	187	To investigate the functional relationship of ghrelin with either the orexins or MCH, we examined the effect of anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs or anti-MCH IgG pretreatment on ghrelin-induced feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Food intake induced by ghrelin was attenuated by anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs, but not anti-MCH IgG pretreatment.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In addition, ghrelin-induced food intake in mice deficient in orexin was significantly lower than that seen in wild-type littermates.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	190	 These data suggest that centrally administered ghrelin increases food intake through the action of the orexin system.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	191	 To date, six functional NPY receptors (Y1 to Y6) have been identified (48, 49).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	192	 NPY stimulates feeding predominantly through Y1 NPY receptor (33, 50).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Icv injection of an Y1 NPY receptor antagonist significantly reduced ghrelin-induced food intake.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Moreover, coadministration of ghrelin and Y1 NPY receptor antagonist following anti-orexin-A and -B IgGs pretreatment abolished ghrelin-induced feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Therefore, ghrelin likely interacts with both the NPY and orexin systems to induce feeding.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	196	Feeding behavior involves the complicated integration of a large number of learning, memory, cognitive, emotional, somatosensorimotor, and autonomic events.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Icv administration of ghrelin strongly induces Fos in the hypothalamus, brain stem, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and piriform cortex (7).
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Centrally administered ghrelin may regulate feeding and energy homeostasis not only through direct activation of orexin and NPY pathways but also through influences on learning and memory, a state of mood, and formation of emotion.
0.21321544.12639935.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Further investigation of ghrelin interactions with other neuronal systems will provide novel insights into the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	202	 To test this hypothesis and understand the basis of brain CCK actions in food intake, we assessed whether the injection of CCK into the DMH affected hypothalamic NPY gene expression.

0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We previously demonstrated that OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR have a deficit in their ability to limit the size of spontaneous meals and a disruption in the regulation of NPY mRNA expression in the DMH.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	217	 We have suggested that both of these alterations may contribute to the hyperphagia and obesity of OLETF rats (19).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The current results demonstrate that CCK-AR to / to  mice also have altered meal patterns.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, in contrast to the OLETF rat, overall food intake is not affected in CCK-AR to / to  mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Thus, although both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR demonstrate a deficit in peripheral CCK satiety actions leading to increased meal size, their overall control of food intake and energy balance appears to differ.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Assessment of the distribution of CCK-AR in the mouse brain revealed no CCK-AR binding activity and no CCK-AR mRNA expression in the DMH in normal mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Previous work has consistently shown that the rat DMH contains CCK-AR (28, 34, 35).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Furthermore, in contrast to the findings of elevated NPY gene expression in the DMH in young preobese and adult pair-fed OLETF rats (21), NPY mRNA expression was not detected in the DMH in either CCK-AR to / to  or CCK-AR+/+ mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Moreover, CCK-AR to / to  mice have normal levels of NPY mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus, where NPY mRNA expression is reduced in ad libitum-fed OLETF rats and is normalized by pair-feeding (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Finally, a potential role for altered DMH NPY expression in hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats is suggested by the demonstrations that NPY and CCK-AR are colocalized in DMH neurons in intact rats and that CCK plays a role in controlling DMH NPY gene expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Together, these results suggest that the differential distribution of brain CCK-AR determines different phenotypes expressed in rats and mice lacking CCK-AR.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	227	The actions of peripheral CCK in the control of meal size are well characterized.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Peripheral CCK produces dose-related suppression of meal size and results in the earlier appearance of a behavioral satiety sequence (11).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These actions of the exogenous peptide appear to mimic a physiological role of endogenous CCK, because administration of CCK antagonists results in an increase in food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The feeding inhibitory actions of both exogenously administered and endogenously released CCK depend upon actions at the CCK-AR.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	231	 CCK-mediated inhibition of food intake is blocked by CCK-AR antagonists, but is unaffected by CCK-BR antagonists (7).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The current finding of increased meal size in CCK-AR to / to  mice demonstrates an action of endogenous CCK in the control of meal size in mice that is consistent with prior data on antagonists and our previous findings in the OLETF rat that also lacks CCK-AR (10, 11, 20).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, these data provide additional molecular biological support for a physiological role for endogenous CCK in the short-term control of food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The magnitude of the change in meal size in CCK-AR to / to  mice was quite a bit smaller than the 80% increase found in OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This difference may reflect a relative difference in the contribution of CCK to meal termination between rats and mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	236	The current data demonstrate that CCK-AR to / to  mice have altered diurnal feeding patterns.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR, increased food intake was characterized by increased meal size in both the dark and light periods.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In response to their increased meal size, meal number was decreased in the dark period, but this decrease was not compensatory (20).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	239	 However, analyses of feeding patterns in CCK-AR to / to  mice revealed increased food intake in the dark period, characterized by an increase in meal size, and food intake tended to be decreased in the light period, characterized by a reduction in meal frequency, leading to the absence of significant changes in total food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	240	 These data suggest that CCK acting through CCK-AR plays a differential role in circadian activities between rats and mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	241	Even though both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR have peripheral CCK satiety deficits, resulting in increased meal size, total daily food intake and body weight were normal in the CCK-AR to / to  mice, whereas OLETF rats lacking CCK-AR have been shown to be hyperphagic and to become obese.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Although this may reflect a differential ability to compensate for smaller rather than larger increases in meal size, the present data also suggest that this difference in phenotype may be the outcome of a different distribution of brain CCK-AR between rats and mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The potential importance of this differential distribution derives from the findings that in intact rats, NPY and CCK-AR are colocalized in DMH neurons, and CCK plays a role in modulating DMH NPY; exogenous administration of CCK into the DMH down-regulates DMH NPY mRNA expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	244	 These results are consistent our previous findings demonstrating that NPY gene expression is up-regulated in the DMH in OLETF rats that lack CCK-AR (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Although pair-feeding OLETF rats prevented their increased body weight and normalized their altered arcuate NPY and POMC gene expression, pair-feeding resulted in significantly elevated NPY gene expression in the DMH.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This elevation of NPY mRNA expression in the DMH was also documented in young preobese OLETF rats (21).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Therefore, CCK acting through CCK-ARs in the DMH appears to suppress DMH NPY gene expression in the rat.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Such a suppression inhibits energy intake, in that DMH CCK injection reduces food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The hyperphagic and obese OLETF rat has a deficit in this CCK-NPY signaling pathway resulting from the lack of CCK-AR production.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	250	 CCK acting through CCK-AR does not appear to play a role in controlling DMH NPY in the mouse.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	251	We failed to detect any NPY mRNA expression in the DMH in either CCK-AR to / to  or CCK-AR+/+ mice by in situ hybridization determination.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	252	 DMH NPY mRNA expression in ad libitum-fed rats is normally low and is only elevated in a few experimental situations, such as lactation (36) or in response to chronic food restriction (25).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In the rat there are clear differences in the controls of DMH and arcuate nucleus NPY-expressing neurons.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In the arcuate nucleus, NPY-containing neurons express Ob-RB, the long form of leptin receptors, and NPY expression is under leptin control (37).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Elevated leptin levels reduce NPY mRNA expression, whereas food deprivation increases arcuate NPY gene expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In contrast, DMH NPY-containing neurons do not express leptin receptors, and DMH NPY mRNA expression does not increase in response to acute food deprivation (25).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Moreover, within the DMH, the region of altered NPY expression in response to a variety of treatments appears to differ.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The current data demonstrating that the reduction of DMH NPY expression by CCK is localized to the compact subregion are consistent with our previous findings (21, 25).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Whereas in lactating rats, Smith (36) had reported that although there was a very slight increase in NPY mRNA expression in the compact area, DMH NPY mRNA expression was mainly induced in the diffuse portion of the DMH.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	260	 However, it is not yet clear whether NPY mRNA expression in different subregions of the DMH is differentially regulated.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Controls of DMH NPY expression in the mouse have not been extensively investigated.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Evidence that there are NPY-expressing neurons in the mouse comes from data demonstrating the induction of DMH NPY expression in several obesity models of disrupted melanocortin signaling: lethal agouti yellow (Ay), melanocortin 4 receptor knockout (MC4R to / to ) mice (38), and diet-induced obese mice (39).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Such data suggest interactions between melanocortin signaling and metabolic status in the control of DMH NPY functions in the mouse.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	264	The finding of decreased arcuate as well as DMH NPY mRNA expression in response to DMH CCK injection was surprising.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Consistent with previous studies in the rat (28, 34), we failed to identify any CCK-AR binding activity in the arcuate nucleus of the mouse.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This absence of arcuate CCK receptors implies a DMH/arcuate interaction in the controls of arcuate NPY.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Although the main hypothalamic output of the DMH is thought to be the PVN, projections from the DMH to the arcuate nucleus have been identified (40).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	268	 These projections may be the basis for the arcuate NPY reduction in response to DMH CCK injection.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	269	A role for the DMH in feeding control has long been suggested.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Bellinger and colleagues (41) demonstrated that small DMH electrolytic or excitotoxic lesions (DMHL) result in hypophagia, hypodipsia, reduced body weight, and reduced linear growth in the rat.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Pair-feeding experiments, in which one group of sham-operated rats was pair-fed by a computerized feeding system that presented food pellets in the same amount and pattern as their "yoked" DMHL rats, demonstrated that the altered body weight in DMHL rats was primarily a result of altered food intake (42).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Despite findings such as these, the particular contribution of the DMH and how it interacts with other hypothalamic nuclei involved in energy balance has not been well understood.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Our findings in the rat suggest that the basis of the DMHL-induced hypophagia may be the elimination of an NPY-ergic output, an output normally under the control of CCK acting through CCK-AR.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Although the distribution and mediation of CCK-AR in human brain are unclear, data from other primates have demonstrated that the DMH contains CCK-AR binding site in the monkey (43), and central injection of the CCK-AR, but not the B receptor, agonist inhibits food intake in the baboon (44).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Such findings as these suggest that the DMH CCK-AR may play a role in food intake control in humans.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	276	 A polymorphism of the CCK-AR gene in patients with obesity and diabetes has been reported in various studies (45, 46, 47, 48), providing support for such a role.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	277	We have interpreted the current data to support the view that the different phenotypes of OLETF rats and CCK to / to  mice derive from a differential role for central CCK-AR in energy balance in rats and mice.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	278	 OLETF rats are not a targeted deletion of CCK-AR, but arose a spontaneous mutation.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	279	 It is quite possible that there are other genetic alterations in the OLETF rat that alone or in combination with the alterations in CCK-AR signaling account for the hyperphagia, obesity, or diabetes (49).
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, such additional genetic defects are yet to be identified.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	281	In summary, the present results suggest that although both rats and mice lacking CCK-AR demonstrate a deficit in meal size control, the differential distribution of CCK-AR in rat and mouse brains may determine the divergent effects of CCK-AR gene disruption.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In the rat brain, CCK acting through CCK-AR appears to play a role in regulating DMH NPY gene expression.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	283	 DMH CCK inhibits NPY mRNA expression and food intake.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In the absence of CCK-AR, OLETF rats have a deficit in the control of DMH NPY gene expression, resulting in increased DMH NPY gene expression, increased food intake, and, eventually, obesity.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In contrast, we found no evidence for the presence of CCK-AR in the DMH of the mouse.
0.100268394.15123537.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Thus, CCK-AR does not contribute to the control of DMH NPY gene expression, and in the absence of this central deficit, mice lacking CCK-AR are able to compensate for the absence of CCK satiety signaling and do not become hyperphagic and obese.

0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	2	The hypothesis was that reducing depression could also reduce fatigue in cancer patients, based on the widespread observation that the two often coexist.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The drug was paroxetine (Paxil ), and there was a feasible biologic model showing how serotonin might play a role in cancer-related fatigue.

0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Morrow, who reported the finding at the May meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in San Francisco, concluded that "it appears unlikely that serotonin is involved as a common mechanism for both fatigue and depression.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	12	" The question, he said, "is probably not worth further study.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	13	The surprising and disappointing outcome of the Paxil trial leaves clinicians about where they were before with little to offer patients for this common and debilitating aspect of cancer treatment.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Other drugs are in the pipeline, however, and more trials are planned as oncologists increasingly recognize the impact of fatigue on patients.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	15	Fatigue affects the majority of cancer patients in treatment, according to various estimates.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For example, one recent survey of more than 300 chemotherapy patients by Greg Curt, M.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	17	, at the National Cancer Institute found that 76% of cancer patients reported fatigue during chemotherapy, and 30% reported that they experienced that fatigue daily.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Among patients who worked, 75% had to change their employment status because of fatigue.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	19	Despite its widespread occurrence, fatigue is seldom addressed in clinical practice.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	20	 And for those who do try to address the problem, the field of potential treatments is still very limited.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	21	 "It s where we were with nausea and emesis 15 years ago," said Morrow.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	22	Of the current candidates for managing fatigue, the most studied is methylphenidate (Ritalin ), the same psychostimulant used widely for attention deficit disorder.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A phase III trial by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group is now comparing methylphenidate to a placebo in patients taking interferon.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Originally designed to test the drug in patients with melanoma who were taking high-dose interferon, this trial has recently been modified to include any cancer patient taking interferon at any dose, said principal investigator Paul Hutson, Pharm.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	25	, University of Wisconsin, Madison.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	26	So far, accrual to the trial has been "slower than we hoped," Hutson said.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	27	 One reason may be that Ritalin is a controlled substance, and in a few states oncologists must obtain permission from state officials to use it in the trial.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	28	Another large, randomized methylphenidate trial, still under review, will test the psychostimulant in chemotherapy not interferon patients, said Morrow, who will also lead this second CCOP trial.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This study will compare the drug to a placebo in more than 700 patients and could open by early fall, Morrow said.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	30	The other frequently mentioned approach for managing fatigue is the use of low-dose steroids, such as dexamethasone and prednisone.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	31	, chairman of the Department of Pain Medicine and Palliative Care at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, said that there is a large clinical experience with these drugs in cancer fatigue and that, among oncologists who do address fatigue, their use "could be called conventional medical practice.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	32	However, they have never been evaluated in a clinical trial in which fatigue was the primary end point.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Portenoy said that the necessity of investing in a randomized controlled trial of steroids is now recognized and that investigators are exploring the possibility.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	34	, chair of ECOG s quality of life committee, said that at its June meeting, the cooperative group would consider a trial with dexamethasone (Decadron ), among other candidates, for managing fatigue.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	35	 He added that the group plans to begin enrolling patients in at least one trial that has fatigue reduction as its end point by the end of the year.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	36	While methylphenidate and low-dose steroids are the two drugs most frequently mentioned, others could be on the way.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A new psychostimulant called modafinil (Provigil ) has been approved for narcolepsy and, anecdotally, seems to have an effect on cancer fatigue.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	38	 "It s getting a lot of favorable reviews," Portenoy said.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	39	, the company that makes the drug, has no plans to evaluate its effect on fatigue in a trial, according to a spokesperson.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, ECOG will consider a trial with modafinil at its June meeting, Cella said.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	41	Erythropoietin is also being considered outside of its standard use in patients with anemia.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	42	 At Beth Israel and several other institutions, a trial in patients who have had brain irradiation is about to begin, Portenoy said, to see whether erythropoietin can alleviate the fatigue associated with this treatment.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	43	The hypothesis is based on animal studies showing that erythropoietin reduces injury from ischemia, concussion, and other types of brain injury.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In support of this idea, a study reported in the September issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences demonstrated that rat brain capillaries have receptors for erythropoietin, enabling the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	45	Erythropoietin to treat fatigue in patients with slightly lowered hemoglobin levels, i.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	46	, lower than 12 g/dL but not lower than 10 g/dL, is also a possibility for a trial.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	47	 It is one of the concepts that ECOG will consider, Cella said.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	48	Another very new approach to fatigue, based on preliminary data, is the use of antihistamines.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In a poster session at the ASCO annual meeting, Eddie Reed, M.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	50	, West Virginia University, Morgantown, reported that the tricyclic antihistamine loratidine (Claritin ) appeared to reduce fatigue among ovarian cancer patients being treated with irofulven.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The finding suggests, he said, that some treatment regimens may induce fatigue through cytokine release mediated by the H-1 histamine receptor.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Reed said that a trial with loratidine, in which fatigue would be an end point, is under consideration.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	53	Nonpharmacologic approaches to cancer fatigue are also under study.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Exercise has been shown to help in small studies among selected patients.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Other investigators are interested in nutrition and alternative therapies, but little evidence of their effectiveness has been published to date.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Cella said that in addition to pharmacologic treatments, the ECOG meeting will consider exercise and lifestyle interventions.
0.095306225.11416103.html.plaintext.txt	57	All symptoms pain, nausea, fatigue, and others have psychological as well as physiologic components, Morrow said, and one of the frontiers in fatigue research is the examination of how behavioral and biological factors may interact.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, subchronic administration does not appear to affect the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid ensemble in animals.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We explored (in 7 patients and 7 controls) whether hypocretin deficiency impacts circulating TSH levels and circadian timing of TSH release in narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Plasma TSH concentration profiles (blood samples taken at 10-min intervals during 24 h) and TSH levels in response to TRH injection were analyzed by Cluster, robust regression, approximate entropy (ApEn), and deconvolution.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Circulating TSH levels were lower in patients, which was primarily attributable to lower pulse amplitude and nadir concentrations.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Pattern-synchrony between 24-h leptin and TSH concentrations was demonstrated by significant cross-correlation and cross-ApEn analyses with no differences between controls and patients.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In summary, circulating TSH concentrations are low in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men, which could be attributable to their low plasma leptin levels and/or their abnormal sleep-wake cycle.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	21	NARCOLEPSY IS A NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), hypnagogic hallucinations, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis (41), which affects 20 to 60 of every 100,000 subjects in the US and Europe (32).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Disruption of hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission underlies the disease in animals and humans (28, 39).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Hypocretins (hypocretin-1 and -2, also called orexin A and B) are produced by a small group of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which project widely throughout the central nervous system (CNS) (8, 56).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is among the various brain sites that receive hypocretin input signals (7).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This nucleus harbors neurons that synthesize thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis (24).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	26	 During starvation, thyroid hormone secretion is suppressed (2, 52), whereas preprohypocretin mRNA is upregulated in the lateral hypothalamus (4).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This led us to hypothesize that hypocretin neural circuits can modulate the activity of hypothalamic TRH neurons and thereby impact the HPT axis.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	28	Studies of the putative effects of hypocretin peptides on the HPT axis in animals have been incomplete, and results are conflicting.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A single intravenous or intracerebroventricular injection of hypocretin-1 in rats acutely decreased plasma TSH concentrations and hypothalamic TRH release (34).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In contrast, several other papers report that hypocretin-1 has no measurable effect on the pituitary thyroid axis (16, 20, 53, 54), whereas circulating TSH was shown to increase in response to central administration of hypocretin-2 (20).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, although the topography of hypocretin- and thyrotrope neural circuits suggests that TRH neuronal activity is governed by hypocretin input, the nature of the signal (i.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	32	, excitatory or inhibitory) remains unclear (where hypocretin-1 and -2 may have differential effects as a result of their distinct chemical structure).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	33	We have previously reported that circulating leptin levels are low in (male) narcoleptic patients (22).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Because leptin has stimulatory effects on the HPT axis, it is conceivable that (relative) hypoleptinemia downregulates HPT axis activity in narcolepsy.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition, the typical disruption of the sleep-wake cycle associated with narcolepsy may also impact TSH release, as sleep inhibits TSH secretion in healthy subjects (42).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	36	To gain insight into the regulation of the HPT axis in hypocretin-deficient humans, we analyzed 24-h plasma TSH and thyroid hormone concentrations in relation to leptin and sleep in seven narcoleptic men and seven healthy controls.

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The univariate approximate entropy (ApEn) statistic was developed to quantify the degree of irregularity, or disorderliness, of a time series (44, 62).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Technically, ApEn quantifies the summed logarithmic likelihood that templates (of length m) of patterns in the data that are similar (within r) remain similar (within the same tolerance r) on next incremental comparison and has been formally defined elsewhere (45).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The ApEn calculation provides a single nonnegative number, which is an ensemble estimate of relative process randomness, wherein larger ApEn values denote greater irregularity.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Cross-ApEn (X-ApEn) quantifies joint pattern synchrony between two separate but parallel time series after standardization (z-score transformation) (47, 51).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In the present analysis, we calculated X-ApEn between leptin and TSH and between sleep and TSH, assuming r = 20% of the SD of the individual time series and m = 1, and hence use the designation X-ApEn (1, 20%).

0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The average TSH concentration was significantly lower in narcoleptic men, which was specifically attributable to a reduction of TSH pulse amplitude, whereas the number of TSH pulses was similar in patients and controls.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The circadian fluctuation of plasma TSH concentrations was comparable in narcoleptics and controls.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Circulating leptin and TSH secretion appeared to correlate positively, whereas sleep was inversely associated with TSH release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Despite the significantly lower plasma TSH concentration in narcoleptics, T4 and T3 concentrations were similar in patients and controls.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	181	TSH synthesis and secretion are primarily regulated by TRH feedforward input and feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	182	 A host of other hormones and neurotransmitters, including somatostatin, catecholamines, various cytokines, and leptin modulate this neuroendocrine ensemble (13, 58).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In addition, sleep has an inhibitory effect on TSH secretion (1, 42).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	184	 TRH is synthesized in the thyrotropic area of the PVN and in the anterior pituitary, where it acts to promote TSH secretion through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, respectively (58).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Although hypocretin neuronal cell bodies heavily project to the PVN (43), it is currently unknown whether hypocretin axons actually synapse with TRH neurons.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It is therefore uncertain whether hypocretins can directly modulate TRH synthesis and release and thus affect TSH secretion.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Also, experiments investigating the impact of (exogenous) hypocretin peptides on TSH release in rodents have yielded inconclusive results.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of hypocretin-1 either reduced plasma TSH levels or showed no effect on TSH and/or TRH release (16, 34, 53, 54).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Thus it seems unlikely that hypocretin deficiency per se inhibits TRH secretion to reduce TSH levels in narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	190	We (22) previously showed that circulating leptin levels are 50% lower in narcoleptic patients than in controls matched for age and body fat mass.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Here, we show that circulating leptin levels and TSH secretion rates are correlated positively in narcoleptic men.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Other studies have revealed that leptin is intimately involved in the regulation of the HPT axis.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Specifically, a reduction of circulating leptin mediates the inhibition of HPT axis activity during starvation (13).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Leptin acts primarily to integrate the activities of neuronal circuits that orchestrate energy balance (40).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In this context, leptin activates -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), whereas it inhibits neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	196	 TRH neurons receive functional inputs from all of these neurotransmitters (10 to 12, 25, 26, 57): NPY/AgRP inhibit TRH release (21), whereas -MSH/CART promote TRH secretion (11, 21).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In addition, leptin can directly stimulate prepro-TRH mRNA synthesis and processing and promote TRH release via activation of leptin receptors on TRH neurons (37).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Moreover, the fact that leptin and leptin receptors are expressed in rodent anterior pituitary cells suggests that leptin may also impact TSH secretion directly (19).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Diurnal pulsatile leptin and TSH levels exhibit strong pattern synchrony in healthy humans, whereas TSH release gets disorganized and its circadian rhythm phase shifted in leptin deficient human subjects (31).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In the present study, we also demonstrate strong pattern synchrony between leptin and TSH both in patients and in controls.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These data clearly suggest that leptin is involved in the regulation of TSH release in rodents and humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus the fact that TSH release rates were positively correlated with circulating leptin levels in the present study supports, but certainly does not prove, the contention that hypoleptinemia blunts TSH secretion in narcoleptic patients.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	203	Diminished dopaminergic tone may also blunt TSH secretion in narcoleptic subjects through diminution of TRH release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Studies using the canine model of narcolepsy suggest that hypoactivity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic circuits are among the major pathophysiological mechanisms in narcolepsy (38).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Recent in vivo brain imaging studies in humans support this notion (9), and the disease is currently treated symptomatically with drugs that enhance monoaminergic (i.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	206	, dopamine, norepinephrine) neurotransmissions (38).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In vitro and in vivo studies clearly show that hypocretin peptides stimulate dopaminergic neurons in various brain sites (16, 36), which also suggests that hypocretin deficiency may silence dopaminergic circuits.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Dopamine promotes TRH release via hypothalamic dopamine D2 receptors (27).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Therefore, hypocretin deficiency may blunt TRH (and thereby TSH) release through diminution of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the hypothalamus.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	210	 However, the role of dopamine in the regulation of TSH secretion is complex, in view of the fact the this monoamine inhibits TSH release at the level of the pituitary (6, 14).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This observation implies that reduced dopaminergic tone would lead to an increase of circulating TSH in narcoleptic subjects.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In this context, it seems important to mention that prolactin secretion, which is also controlled by dopamine at the pituitary level, is not altered in narcoleptic patients (S.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Thus the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of low plasma TSH levels in narcoleptic humans remains uncertain.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	214	Other clinical features of narcolepsy also suggest that TRH deficiency [through hypoleptinemia or other (unknown) causes] may be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	215	 EDS and cataplexy are reflections of depressed activity of the CNS.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Accordingly, the current options for treatment of narcolepsy include CNS stimulants for EDS and antidepressants for cataplexy (41).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	217	 TRH receptors are distributed widely in the CNS (15), and TRH has diverse neuromodulating actions (15, 48).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Among many other features, it has CNS-stimulant and -antidepressant effects (18, 29).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Interestingly, chronic administration of a TRH analog increases wakefulness and ameliorates cataplexy in narcoleptic dogs (50), which may imply that diminished TRH tone is involved in the pathogenesis of these narcoleptic symptoms.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, the fact that circulating prolactin levels are normal in narcoleptic humans (unpublished observation) argues against (but does not exclude) a primary TRH deficiency in these patients, as TRH is involved in the regulation of prolactin release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	221	Sleep has an inhibitory effect on TSH release, as demonstrated in the human under a normal light-dark cycle and during sleep and light-dark cycle manipulations (1, 17).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms are not known.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In the present study, sleep and plasma TSH levels were inversely associated, and sleep periods were invariably followed by a reduction of TSH concentration in both patients and controls, suggesting that hypocretins are not involved in the coupling of sleep and TSH release.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The present data also suggest that the fact that patients slept longer than controls may have contributed to the reduction of their TSH levels.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	225	Hypersensitivity of the thyroid gland to TSH stimulation may also contribute to the alterations of the pituitary thyroid ensemble described here.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Despite the fact that TSH levels were reduced in narcoleptic subjects, plasma T4 and T3 concentrations were similar to those in healthy controls and completely within the normal range.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This may imply that the thyroid is more sensitive to TSH stimulation in narcoleptics (unfortunately, our study does not yield further data to support this notion).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Thyroid hypersensitivity to TSH may be brought about by the reduction of sympathetic tone in these patients (55), as TSH-induced T4 release is inhibited by 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation (30, 35).
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	229	 This putative resetting of the pituitary-thyroid axis could fully explain our observations.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In any case, the fact that thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range in narcoleptics indicates that these patients are euthyroid.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, it remains to be established whether the ensemble acts appropriately under conditions of greater metabolic demands, such as growth, cold adaptation, or pregnancy.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	232	Our data clearly show that the ApEn statistic can appropriately detect disorderliness of sleep patterns in narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus it is conceivable that the application of ApEn analysis to sleep patterns and the effect of drug therapy in other sleep disorders and to physiological studies of sleep and related neuroendocrine phenomena might contribute to further understanding of the complicated networks involved.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	234	In conclusion, the present study shows that circulating TSH concentrations are reduced in the face of normal plasma thyroid hormone concentrations in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.44176623.15625087.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Hypoleptinemia and disorderly sleep episodes of longer duration may be involved in the pathophysiology of this neuroendocrine feature of narcolepsy.

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	4	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Several lines of evidence substantiate the important role of the central nervous system melanocortin 3- and 4-receptor (MC3/4-R) system in the control of food intake and energy balance.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), an endogenous antagonist of these receptors, produces a robust and unique pattern of increased food intake that lasts up to 7 days after a single injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Little is known about brain regions that may mediate this powerful effect of AgRP on food intake.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To this end we compared c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI) in several brain sites of rats injected intracerebroventricularly with 1 nmol AgRP-(83 to 132) 2 and 24 h before death and compared c-FLI patterns to those induced by another potent orexigenic peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although both NPY and AgRP induced c-FLI in hypothalamic areas, AgRP also produced increased c-FLI in the accumbens shell and lateral septum.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although NPY elicited no changes in c-FLI 24 h after administration, AgRP induced c-FLI in the accumbens shell, nucleus of the solitary tract, central amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results indicate that an NPY-like hypothalamic circuit mediates the short-term effects of AgRP, but that the unique sustained effect of AgRP on food intake involves a complex circuit of key extrahypothalamic reward and feeding regulatory nuclei.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	11	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   MUCH EVIDENCE establishes the central melanocortin (MC) system as an important regulator of food intake and energy balance (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The endogenous melanocortin, MSH, binds to MC3 and MC4 receptors (MC3/4-R) where its agonist actions limit food intake.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Central injection of MSH (6, 7) or synthetic agonists (1, 8, 9, 10) reduces feeding.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	14	 MSH appears critical in this regard, because blockade of endogenous MSH using a synthetic MC3/4-R antagonist, SHU9119, reverses the natural hypophagia in animals overfed to gain weight (2), and SHU9119 potently stimulates feeding in sated animals (1, 9).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	15	Interestingly, there is an endogenous antagonist for MC3/4-R, termed Agouti-related peptide (AgRP).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	16	 AgRP is synthesized exclusively in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, projecting to other hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic sites (11, 12, 13).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Central administration of the fragment AgRP-(83 to 132) (14) increases food intake (15).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	18	 States of energy deficiency increase AgRP expression (16, 17), and transgenic mice overexpressing AgRP are hyperphagic and obese (18).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	19	We recently found that AgRP-(83 to 132) induces a long-lasting increase in food intake up to 168 h after a single third ventricular injection of 100 pmol in rats.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	20	 AgRP s short-term hyperphagia involves competitive MC3/4-R antagonism, whereas the persistent effects engage alternate, as yet unknown, mechanisms (19, 20).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Our goal in this study was to begin to elucidate the central nervous system (CNS) circuits that subserve AgRP s potent and remarkably sustained increase in food intake.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We measured changes in neuronal activation induced by AgRP using immunohistochemistry for the protein associated with the immediate-early gene, c-fos (21).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We compared the areas activated by AgRP 2 h after administration with the areas activated a full 24 h after administration.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Additionally, we compared the pattern of AgRP-induced neuronal activation to that elicited by another potent stimulator of food intake, neuropeptide Y (NPY).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Given that NPY is extensively colocalized with AgRP (16, 22), our hypothesis was that these two peptides might engage similar circuits in the short term.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, given that NPY does not stimulate intake for long periods like AgRP, we hypothesized that the circuits engaged by NPY and AgRP would be different after 24 h.

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The possibility that feeding could influence AgRP-induced c-Fos-like immunoreactivity (c-FLI) patterns was minimized by removing all food for a period of 6 h before the time of death for animals killed at both the 2 and 24 h periods.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Although we cannot completely rule out a possible influence of AgRP-induced food intake on c-FLI patterns in rats killed 24 h after injection (who had 18-h access to food before it was removed for 6 h), a feeding effect is unlikely because feeding-induced Fos patterns observed by others (24) differed from those observed here after AgRP.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The selected doses of NPY and AgRP lie within ranges that elicit a similar magnitude of increased food intake over 2 h when injected intraventricularly in rats (15, 19, 25).

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Forebrains were frozen and sectioned at 40- microm thickness in a coronal plane, and hindbrains were sectioned in a horizontal plane to visualize sites of interest.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	46	 For each of the 12 sites examined, one section was selected representing each plane, and care was taken to closely match that plane across rats.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The sections were chosen by an experimenter blind to group treatments.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The same procedure was followed for sections taken 24 h after injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	49	 With the exception of two rats contributing sections from forebrain regions in the 24-h NPY condition, sections were taken from a total of three rats in the 2-h saline, four rats in the 24-h saline, three rats in the 2-h NPY, four rats in the 24-h NPY, four rats in the 2-h AgRP, and five rats in the 24-h AgRP condition.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Immunohistochemical procedures were conducted and quantified as previously described (8).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Bilateral sections were quantified for each brain site of interest, except in the accumbens shell that was counted unilaterally.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Neuroanatomical boundaries (23) are given in Table 1.

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	54	  Comparisons between time points were not conducted because the two time points differed in their proximity to the injection procedure.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Rather, we compared each time point to its own saline-injected control to determine changes in c-FLI associated with the treatment.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Therefore, data were analyzed by one-way ANOVAs to specifically examine differences between treatment groups (saline vs.

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	60	 1A, saline-induced c-FLI was most notable in hypothalamic regions.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Increased NPY-induced c-FLI relative to saline occurred in the caudal accumbens shell, lateral septum, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), dorsal region of the dorsomedial nucleus (DMN), the nucleus solitary tract (NTS) and commissural NTS with c-FLI at 300%, 590%, 460%, 240%, 1500%, and 360% of saline-induced levels, respectively (Fig.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	62	 However, only in the PVN was NPY-induced c-FLI statistically different from saline-induced levels.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	63	 AgRP elicited a similar c-FLI pattern to NPY (Table 2), except that AgRP elicited higher c-FLI in the rostral accumbens shell and DMN (300% and 180% greater than NPY-induced c-FLI, respectively) and lower c-FLI than NPY in the commissural NTS and NTS proper.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The only statistically significant differences between NPY and AgRP-provoked c-FLI occurred in the commissural NTS (Fig.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Comparisons between NPY- and AgRP- induced c-FLI could not be made in the amygdala and lateral hypothalamus due to an artifact in the slicing process that disrupted the morphological integrity of these sections and prevented accurate orientation of these sites to match those taken from other brains.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Previous studies led us to predict that NPY, like AgRP, would evoke increased c-FLI expression in these areas (26, 27).

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In fact, c-FLI in the rostral and caudal accumbens shell, lateral septum, central amygdala, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and NTS were greater at this delayed time point than shortly after AgRP injection (Table 2).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	82	 1B, c-FLI in the rostral and caudal accumbens shell remained elevated at 24 h (1550% and 2400% of control value, respectively), albeit to a lesser degree than observed at the 2 h point.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	83	 c-FLI in the NTS was considerably elevated (426% of control value) compared with c-FLI expression there at 2 h, and whereas no significant c-FLI changes were observed in the central amygdala and lateral hypothalamus at 2 h after AgRP, after 24 h these areas displayed 14- and 128-fold increased c-FLI over that with saline treatment, respectively.

0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	89	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   AgRP is distinct in being a naturally occurring antagonist in the brain, binding to MC3/4-R presumably to inhibit the melanocortin ligand, MSH (4, 18).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Also unique is AgRP s ability to stimulate food intake in rats for a prolonged interval, up to 7 days after a single central picomolar dose (19).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We observed that whereas the acute increase in intake seen after AgRP involves intrinsic action at the MC3/4-R, the sustained hyperphagia relies on alternate and unique mechanisms (19).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	92	The present study was conducted to begin elucidating the CNS mechanisms engaged by AgRP to mediate its effect on food intake.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	93	 c-FLI was used to identify neuroanatomical sites activated both acutely and after 24 h after AgRP.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Two hours after AgRP injection, a time point reflecting the acute induction of food intake, the largest c-FLI response occurred in the hypothalamic PVN and the DMN and in the accumbens shell and lateral septum outside the hypothalamus.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In the PVN and DMN, sites dense with MC3/4-R (28), c-FLI is probably due to competitive binding at MC3/4-R.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	96	 PVN injection of MTII, a MC3/4-R agonist, suppresses intake in fasted rats, an effect reversible by SHU9119, a MC3/4-R antagonist (29).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	97	 AgRP acts in an inhibitory manner, decreasing MSH- induced cAMP activation (4, 11, 15), and MC3/4-R agonists potentiate -aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition of postsynaptic PVN neurons (29).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Because c-FLI is induced at the transcriptional level with extracellular stimulation and not inhibition (21), c-FLI observed in the PVN may reflect AgRP inhibition of GABA to release PVN neurons from their inhibitory signals.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	99	To further understand AgRP s actions, we compared its c-FLI pattern to that induced by NPY.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Both peptides induce potent hyperphagia in animals (5, 30, 31), and both are extensively coexpressed and colocalized in the arcuate nucleus (16, 22).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	101	 AgRP and NPY activated common neuroanatomical targets 2 h after infusion, including the ACSh, lateral septum, PVN, anterior hypothalamic area, DMN, and NTS.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The largest c-FLI response occurred in the PVN after both AgRP and NPY.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	103	The PVN is critical in regulating energy intake and metabolism, and NPY mediates many of these actions (31, 32).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The colocalization and density of NPY and melanocortin receptors in the PVN (28) suggest that AgRP, like NPY and perhaps in concert with NPY, has a prominent role in the control of energy homeostasis.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The DMN also had high levels of c-FLI after AgRP and NPY injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Morphologically linked to the PVN, the DMN is also important in energy regulation (33).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	107	 DMN-lesioned rats are hypophagic (33), and a high level of NPY expression specifically in the DMN is associated with obesity in MC4-R-deficient mice (34).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Given that both NPY and AgRP impact activity in the DMN, the current results implicate the DMN as one area where NPY and AgRP may interact in coordinating the response to negative energy balance.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Like AgRP, NPY is also an inhibitory peptide; its stimulation of receptors promotes inhibition of adenylate cyclase (35).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Hence, the expression of c-FLI observed after NPY injection in these nuclei probably reflects NPY inhibition of catabolic signals produced by peptides known to interact with NPY, such as leptin and MSH (1, 17, 29).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	111	Outside of the hypothalamus, AgRP evoked c-FLI in the accumbens shell and lateral septum.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Similar c-FLI increases have been observed in the lateral septum after lateral ventricular injection of NDP-MSH, a MC3/4-R agonist (36).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The nucleus accumbens contains MC4-R, but no AgRP-containing fibers, whereas the lateral septum is moderately innervated by AgRP fibers (22).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The accumbens shell is innervated by viscero-endocrine circuits and integrates reward signals from the lateral hypothalamus with food intake (37).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The accumbens is largely innervated by GABA neurons and enkephalin terminals are abundant in the shell (38).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Inhibition of accumbens shell neurons by GABA agonists elicits a powerful lateral hypothalamus stimulation-like feeding response (37).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The lateral hypothalamus also had nonsignificant, but 8-fold, increases in c-FLI after AgRP relative to that after saline treatment.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	118	 It is tempting to speculate that AgRP may activate an opioid or other reward regulatory circuit as it elicits feeding, possibly via interaction with MC3/4-R that may inhibit accumbens GABA neurons, as proposed for AgRP s action in the PVN (29).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Consistent with this observation that NPY-induced hyperphagia is suppressed by an opioid antagonist (39), we recently found that the same opioid antagonist suppresses the hyperphagia induced after the injection of AgRP (40).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Activation of an accumbens opioid system, however, is only one potential mediator of AgRP hyperphagia.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In the hindbrain, NPY, but not AgRP, increased c-FLI in the NTS.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Others have reported increased c-FLI in medial areas of the NTS after fourth ventricular injection of NPY and in the absence of food (41), and neuronal activation in the NTS is generally associated with feeding (27, 41).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	123	Although a powerful tool, c-FLI data are limited, in that they cannot describe the neurochemical phenotype of neurons being activated or the critical connections to other nuclei to affect feeding.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Fos data are also limited, in that they cannot identify neurons that have been inhibited by the treatment.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Furthermore, the absence of c-FLI expression in nuclei does not mean these are not activated, as some brain cells do not express c-FLI when stimulated.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Therefore, future dual labeling studies are warranted to identify the neurochemical phenotype of activated neurons with, for example, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine as possible candidates in accumbens shell neurons (37, 38).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Another limitation of the current study is that ventricular injection is expected to distribute NPY and AgRP in a pattern that is not identical to that of the endogenous secretion of these peptides.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Hence, these data indicate which circuits can be recruited by these peptides rather than determine exactly which ones are engaged during endogenous secretion.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Complementary studies using peptide injection into discrete sites will help determine the neuroanatomical origin of the observed effect on c-FLI expression or possibly elucidate divergent patterns.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	130	 As AgRP produces hyperphagia for as long as 7 days after injection (20), it will also be of future interest to observe whether c-FLI patterns produced by AgRP beyond 24 h after injection are recapitulated or are different from the patterns observed at 24 h after injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	131	The other intriguing aspect of AgRP s effect on behavior is its ability to stimulate increased intake for up to 7 days with a single picomolar injection (19), a behavior not observed after NPY.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Based on our previous data suggesting that mechanisms other than competitive binding at the MC3/4-R mediate AgRP s long-term effects (19), and on the discovery that AgRP elicits hyperphagia in MC4-R-deficient mice (42), we hypothesized that AgRP would recruit additional neuroanatomical substrates 24 h after injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	133	 At no site examined was c-FLI increased 24 h after NPY injection.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, the extended CNS actions of AgRP were evident from increased c-FLI in 10 of the 12 sites studied compared with that after saline treatment.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Accumbens shell activation was even greater than that observed at 2 h, whereas activity in the PVN, anterior hypothalamus, and dorsomedial nucleus decreased or returned to control levels.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Nonsignificant c-FLI elevations in the central amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and NTS at 2 h became significant after 24 h.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	137	 It is unlikely that AgRP-stimulated feeding before the 6-h fast induced these patterns, as others have found opposite patterns of c-Fos expression in the dorsomedial nucleus and NTS in response to ingestion (24).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	138	A functional link between the accumbens shell and the lateral hypothalamus in the control of feeding is well established (37, 43).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Both the accumbens and lateral hypothalamus are innervated by and functionally interconnected with the amygdala (44).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The central amygdala has a key role in integrating food intake with learned, hedonic, and emotional inputs (45, 46).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Projections from the central amygdala to the NTS (44, 47) have been implicated in the control of food intake (48, 49).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In summary, the strong c-FLI expression evoked by AgRP in the ACSh, lateral hypothalamus, central amygdala, and NTS 24 h after injection suggests that these nuclei form a functional circuit through which AgRP may mediate long-lasting changes in food intake.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	143	These long-lasting orexigenic effects may involve modulation of the release or expression of other orexigenic peptides localized within these nuclei, such as hypocretin and melanin-concentrating hormone.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	144	 AgRP may stimulate hypocretin release, which is contained in the lateral hypothalamus, is surrounded by AgRP-containing cell bodies (22), and elicits a extrahypothalamic c-FLI pattern very similar to that induced by AgRP when injected in the lateral hypothalamus (49).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	145	 AgRP may have similar effects on melanin-concentrating hormone, which is also contained in the lateral hypothalamus and is expressed in some of the extrahypothalamic sites that were c-Fos reactive to AgRP (50).
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	146	 AgRP may also induce transcriptional changes leading to altered synaptic efficacy in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic proteins involved in the regulation of energy balance.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	147	Depletion of an organism s caloric stores results in strong behavioral changes to find and ingest calories.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Consistent with this survival function, AgRP elicits the most long-lasting effect to increase food intake of any acute pharmacological manipulation of the CNS.
0.103533715.11181518.html.plaintext.txt	149	 AgRP apparently accomplishes this by recruitment of anatomical sites inside and outside of the hypothalamus, sites that integrate and relay gustatory, sensory, and reward properties of food.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Leptin was studied for its linkage to metabolic signs of sleep loss and its correspondence to altered neuroendocrine regulation in other disease states.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Last, plasma corticosterone was measured to investigate the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Sleep deprivation was produced by the disk-over-water method, a well-established means of selective deprivation of sleep and noninterference with normal waking behaviors.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Hormone concentrations were determined in sham comparisons and at intervals during baseline and experimental periods lasting at least 15 days in partially and totally sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The results indicate that high-amplitude pulses of GH were nearly abolished and that concentrations of GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin all were suppressed by sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Corticosterone concentration was relatively unaffected.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Features of these results, such as low GH and low IGF-I, indicate failed negative feedback and point to hypothalamic mechanisms as containing the foci responsible for peripheral signs.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Some of the clinical states associated with abnormal sleep include pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular disease, thrombotic disease, epilepsy, arthritis, mood disorders, chronic pain, and shortened life span (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The physical consequences of sleep deprivation have not been localized.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Evidence from studies in laboratory animals suggest that multitropic factors in immune and hormonal systems contribute to the absence of localization.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	21	The three principal consequences of prolonged sleep deprivation in the rat are a progressively deepening negative energy balance (8, 18, 23), reduced thyroid hormone concentrations (8, 19, 20), and abnormal control of microorganisms (22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Sleep-deprived rats become strikingly and progressively hyperphagic but do not gain weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The negative energy balance is not due to malabsorption of calories (8) or diabetes (18) but may be a metabolic response to infectious processes.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Abnormal control of microorganisms was discovered by the detection of live, pathogenic bacteria in normally sterile body tissues (16, 22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This deficiency in the host defense system is the earliest clinically and biologically significant sign so far discovered, occurring within five experimental days when the outward appearance of the animal is healthy and metabolic changes are not as marked as they later become.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The third principal feature, hypothyroxinemia, is manifested by a progressive decline in both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), with T4 eventually reaching levels below assay detection in some cases (20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	27	 After an average of 3 wk, these and other signs result in advanced morbidity (scrawny and feeble appearance, decreased food intake from peak consumption) and hypothermia (8, 18), primary bacteremia with poor or absent inflammatory responses (16), and subsequent lethality (53).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	28	Recent findings on the alterations in thyroid hormones in sleep-deprived rats point to the brain as the essential site of sleep deprivation effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A progressive decline in plasma T4 in sleep-deprived rats is not accompanied by an increase in plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), whereas low plasma T4 is normally a potent stimulant for pituitary TSH secretion (71).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Challenge tests of TSH release from the pituitary by exogenous administration of the hypothalamic peptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) revealed normal stimulated release of TSH and an appropriate increase in circulating T4 and T3 (20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Examination of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus revealed an eventual tripling of TRH transcript levels in most experimental animals, suggesting a compensatory response to low T4, presumably through increased negative feedback to the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Even so, TSH failed to respond to increased TRH biosynthesis (19).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These data suggest that TRH stimulation of TSH is inhibited and that one locus of sleep deprivation's effects is TRH translation or release by the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	34	Relatively little is known regarding other neuroendocrine consequences of sustained sleep deprivation and whether there is broad pituitary or hypothalamic involvement.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	35	 One of the objectives of the present series of experiments was to determine whether chronic sleep deprivation also affects the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Alteration in their pleiotropic functions could provide future avenues of discovery for how sleep deprivation specifically results in health consequences.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Linkage of GH and PRL secretion to non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep has been repeatedly demonstrated in humans.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Plasma peak GH concentration generally coincides with sleep onset and is delayed if sleep is delayed.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Smaller GH peaks generally coincide with subsequent slow-wave sleep phases (52, 56, 64, 73).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	40	 PRL concentrations are elevated during sleep, even if sleep is delayed (74).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Short-term sleep deprivation of 24 to 36 h blunts the amplitude of major GH secretory periods during that time (10, 11), whereas sleep after sleep deprivation is associated with a return of normal amplitudes (11, 59, 73).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Similarly, GH pulses in rats are abolished during short-term sleep deprivation of 3 h (34).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Whether abolishment would persist beyond 3 h and whether this is an acute reaction are unknown.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The proximal hypothalamic mechanisms regulating GH secretion by the pituitary are growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (somatotropin release-inhibiting factor; SRIF), which operate in a reciprocal manner.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Previous studies have shown that short-term sleep deprivation of 6 to 8 h can reduce the content of GHRH in the hypothalamus (26) and result in increased GHRH mRNA in the PVN and increased SRIF mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (69).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Whether these changes are important to hypophysioportal stimulation of GH secretion is unknown, whereas hypotheses exist for their role in the regulation of sleep behavior (26).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Furthermore, GHRH binding and receptor mRNA levels are decreased by 50% in the hypothalamus of rats sleep deprived for 8 h, whereas pituitary levels remain unchanged.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	48	 These latter findings have been interpreted as indicating downregulation of receptors in response to GHRH release (27).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In addition to its role in lactation, PRL is a major anabolic hormone and cytokine (5).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Short-term sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation in humans are associated with lower nocturnal PRL levels than when sleep occurs (74, 77).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	51	 PRL is considered to be sleep promoting in laboratory animals (50, 80) and is reduced by 24 and 72 h, but not by 48 h, of sleep deprivation combined (i.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	52	, confounded) with constant forced locomotion (33).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Deficiency of PRL results in grossly reduced immunocompetency in laboratory animals (49), to which sleep-deprived rats share a resemblance.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	54	It is also unknown at present whether sustained sleep deprivation affects the secretion of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, which acts on the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Leptin has endocrine actions and pleiotropic effects that include a major role in the regulation of energy balance (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Several lines of evidence suggest a link between this hormone and different pathophysiological changes resulting from sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	57	 For example, decreased leptin concentrations occur with decreased fat reserve and impairments of immunity (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	58	 25), which are consequences of sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	59	 On the other hand, increases in leptin secretion are associated with increased sympathetic activation (58), elevated metabolic rate (45), and decreased body weight (12), which are also produced by prolonged sleep deprivation (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Leptin also increases in response to exposure to bacterial cell components (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	61	 30), which would be an expected event resulting from bacterial translocation and efforts to control posttranslocation survival in sleep-deprived animals (22).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In humans, substantially reduced leptin concentrations have been found in narcoleptic patients, who have abnormal sleep architecture (36, 60), and mildly reduced leptin concentrations have been found in normal subjects under conditions of acute sleep reduction (62).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	63	The objective of the present studies was to determine whether chronic sleep deprivation changes the regulation of GH, PRL, and leptin, and, if so, the nature of the alterations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The effects of sleep deprivation were determined on concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), because it is the principal physiological mediator of many GH actions, and on concentrations of corticosterone, which in high levels is associated with endocrine abnormalities in other disease states (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To this end, we employed a well-established procedure for producing sleep deprivation (9) and examined its effects on hormonal secretory patterns at intervals during the first two-thirds of the typical survival period for rats, at times before advanced morbidity.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The present results indicate abnormally low concentrations of GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin, but appropriately increased PRL release when stimulated.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These results provide evidence of altered hormonal regulation at the level of the hypothalamus and implicate suppression of anabolic hormones among the important health consequences of sleep deprivation.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Briefly, two animals are housed under identical experimental conditions on either side of a large, round platform (46 cm diameter) divided by a Plexiglas wall.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	94	 One rat is designated for sleep deprivation, and the other rat is designated as a yoked animal to be subjected to the same experimental variables, yet allowed opportunities to sleep.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Beneath and around the platform is shallow water that serves as a soft boundary.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The rats almost always avoid the water and stay on the platform where they can eat, sleep, and explore normally.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Recording of EEG variables under the rats' freely moving conditions is accomplished by connecting the long recording cable attached to the head electrode assembly to a 360 degrees  commutator and then to a counterbalanced boom assembly.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The method produces a consistent amount of sleep reduction in our studies (16, 18, 21, 23).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Under baseline conditions, sleep occurs during an average of 53% of the time.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The sleep comprises 48% NREM sleep (comparable to human stages 1 to 4) and 6% paradoxical sleep (PS; also known as rapid eye movement sleep).

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Detection of sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, by programmed microprocessing of amplitude changes in cortical EEG, cortical theta, and electromyographic variables, results in 6 s of forced locomotion for both rats, which is sufficient to produce arousal.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This is repeated upon each subsequent sleep onset in the sleep-deprived rat, resulting in wakefulness sustained over 90% of total time.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	107	The yoked rat may sleep when the platform is stationery because the sleep-deprived rat is engaged in behaviors other than trying to sleep.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Yoked animals are awake 58% of the time and obtain NREM and PS sleep during 38 and 3% of total time, respectively.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Each yoked animal is frequently awakened when asleep because sleep normally occupies 50% of the time, and the yoked rat is paired to a sleep-deprived rat that may fall asleep, thus triggering platform rotation.

0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	285	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   The major findings of the present studies are that prolonged sleep deprivation in rats produced profound decreases in circulating GH, IGF-I, PRL, and leptin.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The suppressions occurred within the early phase of chronic sleep deprivation, a time when the overt appearance of the animals was relatively healthy.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Reduced secretion of these hormones was sustained throughout the experimental period and occurred in conjunction with weight loss and dramatically increased food consumption, the latter of which has been reported previously (18, 23).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Considered together with the prior demonstration from this laboratory that sleep deprivation produces hypothyroxinemia of central origin (20), the present results indicate that sleep deprivation results in, and sustains, a wide range of neuroendocrine disruptions.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The nature of these disruptions points to altered central regulation at the level of the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	290	GH secretion was assessed by measurement of major GH secretory periods in a subgroup of sleep-deprived and yoked comparisons studied under intensive blood sampling protocols and under freely moving conditions.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Sleep-deprived animals showed diminished circulating GH and a prevailing absence of major secretory GH bursts that had been observed during their baseline periods.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	292	 IGF-I, considered the main effector molecule of GH secretion in many tissues, was also consistently suppressed in sleep-deprived rats by 31 to 42% throughout each 4-day interval of observation, concomitant with robust food intake.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Measurement of circulating IGF-I levels in well-nourished subjects is believed to reflect 24-h secretion of GH from the pituitary gland (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Yoked animals under partial sleep deprivation conditions showed a strong tendency for an overall decrease from baseline GH concentration but showed evidence of relatively well-preserved major GH secretory periods of high-amplitude pulses that were relatively unchanged in duration or frequency.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Taken together, these results provide evidence of diminished GH availability and effector activity in the periphery of totally sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	296	PRL and GH share 40% homology, and GH can substitute for PRL deficiency to some extent (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Sleep-deprived animals also showed a large reduction of 52% in basal circulating PRL during the first few days of sleep deprivation and maintenance of suppressed concentrations during the experimental period.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	298	 By comparison, yoked animals under partial sleep deprivation were variously affected; individual instances sometimes were of increased PRL concentration.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Challenge tests of pituitary secretion of PRL by TRH administration yielded an initial PRL response that was proportional to normal in both sleep-deprived and yoked rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	300	 However, the total amount of poststimulation PRL secreted over 40 min was significantly less in sleep-deprived rats than during the baseline period, reflecting diminished basal concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Yoked animals under conditions of partial sleep deprivation tended to show the same direction of change in post-TRH PRL concentrations as did the totally sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	302	Both experimental groups of sleep-deprived rats and partially sleep-deprived yoked rats showed significant reductions in circulating leptin concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	303	 This finding has effectively ruled out hyperleptinemia as a plausible mediator of sleep deprivation signs, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, increased energy expenditure, loss of weight, and suppression of IGF-I.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Rather, plasma levels of leptin appeared to reflect energy stores that became inadequate, eventually manifested by the animal's increased food consumption and failure to gain weight.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Leptin is now considered a critical peripheral hormonal signal of the status of body energy stores to the brain and functions within a long-term homeostatic system balancing food intake and energy expenditure, requiring time to gear up the adaptive responses to a negative energy balance (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	306	Low leptin and increased corticosterone concentrations are reciprocal responses to a negative energy balance during starvation (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	307	 24) or experimentally induced insulin-deficient diabetes (4).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In these states, increased glucocorticoids are known to alter functions carried out by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and to suppress immunity (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The present results suggest that this same reciprocal relationship and its associated circumstances do not extend de facto to the sleep-deprived state.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	310	 In rats rendered diabetic (4) and in rats fasted for  > 4 to 72 h (46, 75, 76), increases in corticosterone typically are three- to fivefold or more.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	311	 In rats in studies of behavioral stress, increases in corticosterone can be ninefold (29, 51), and PRL is increased (67).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	312	 By comparison, in the present study, sleep-deprived rats showed only a mild tendency for increased corticosteroid concentrations by 50%, and not more than was recorded at various times for the other two groups.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	313	 This result replicates previous findings (8, 20) and corroborates the mild or unchanged values found in the results of human studies of selective sleep deprivation (37, 38, 70).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Although changes in corticosteroid receptors, sensitivity, and catabolism cannot yet be ruled out, corticosterone concentration in sleep-deprived rats appears consistent with what may be expected to mobilize fuel to support metabolic and cellular requirements.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	315	 As such, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis thus does not appear overactivated, implying that corticosterone has no more than a modulatory role in either the suppression of anabolic hormones or the suppression of immunity in sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	316	Further studies will be necessary to characterize the mechanisms underlying suppression of GH, PRL, IGF-I, and leptin elucidated by the present studies, and inappropriately low TSH, as shown previously (19, 20).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	317	 However, several lines of evidence suggest the hypothalamus is the primary locus affected by sleep deprivation, with possible secondary pituitary involvement.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	318	 For example, under normal conditions, a decrease in IGF-I is associated with an increase in GH release via a long negative feedback loop to the brain (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The specific feedback mechanisms of IGF-I to GH mechanisms in the hypothalamus are not well elucidated but are believed to involve increased inhibitory tone by SRIF or reduced GHRH (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	320	 68), which normally operate in a reciprocal manner to regulate GH secretion.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	321	 For reduced IGF-I negative feedback to the hypothalamus to fail to increase GH would suggest increased SRIF tone and/or decreased GHRH.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Evidence consistent with this framework is a finding by Gardi et al.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	323	 (26) that short-term sleep deprivation in rats reduces amounts of GHRH and tends to increase amounts of SRIF in the hypothalamus, and findings by Toppila et al.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	324	 (69) that show increases in SRIF mRNA in the arcuate nucleus during short-term sleep deprivation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	325	PRL is different from other pituitary hormones in that it has no target organs to supply feedback hormones.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	326	 The primary influence on PRL secretion is inhibition by the hypothalamus.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	327	 In the present study, the absolute concentration of PRL was diminished in the sleep-deprived rats, yet exogenous stimulation by the hypothalamic peptide TRH led to a PRL response that was of comparable relative amplitude to baseline and to comparison conditions, suggesting that PRL synthesis and storage is not the primary reason for low circulating PRL.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	328	 This finding is consistent with previous studies that showed an appropriate pituitary response of TSH release after TRH administration (20) and points to insufficient stimulation of the pituitary during sleep deprivation in a manner that would have resulted in maintenance of normal peripheral PRL concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	329	It is possible that the decrease in circulating leptin, consequent to sleep deprivation-induced negative energy balance, contributes to the reductions in GH and PRL secretion and the inappropriately low TSH concentrations associated with hypothyroxinemia.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Leptin exerts negative feedback directly on the hypothalamus (reviewed in Refs.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Low circulating leptin under conditions of a negative energy balance or induced by experimental means is a potent signal for increased mRNA expression, secretion of neuropeptide Y, and agouti-related peptide in the hypothalamus, and reduced signaling of -melanocyte-stimulating hormone and its precursor proopiomelanocortin (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	332	 These changes are relevant to determining mediation of increased food intake and the causal direction between altered regulation of neuroendocrine peptides and development of a negative energy balance.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Diminished leptin is associated with abolition of GH secretory peaks, and administration of leptin is associated with restoration of those peaks (66) by affecting GHRH and SRIF (78).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Similarly, decreased leptin resulting from food deprivation is associated with decreased circulating thyroid hormones and PRL, and administration of leptin under these conditions reverses both of these hormonal changes (1, 28, 41, 79).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	335	 However, the present results suggest that leptin may not be the necessary and sufficient factor for reduction of these hormones, since partially sleep-deprived rats showed equivalent reductions in leptin secretion but less interference with pituitary hormone secretion.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	336	 A growing body of evidence indicates central integration of leptin signaling and central control over leptin concentrations.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	337	The hormonal changes in sleep-deprived rats may be viewed either as dysfunctional or as adaptive responses.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	338	 On the one hand, there is abundant evidence that diseases with a central locus, such as hypothalamic dysfunction, can produce peripheral effects and changes in neuroendocrine regulation (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	339	 On the other hand, low leptin and suppression of anabolic hormones may be viewed as adaptive responses to a negative energy balance, as evidenced by the progressive food intake and body weight changes in sleep-deprived rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Suggestions that the central effects of sleep deprivation should be considered dysfunctional rather than adaptive come from examples that contrast sleep-deprived and starved rats.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Quite opposite to starved rats, declines of T4 and T3 in sleep-deprived rats are consistent with metabolic activation and not with downregulation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The ratio of T3 to T4 is dramatically increased (8), indicating a strong preference for the most metabolically active form of thyroid hormone without an increase in reverse T3 in a metabolically inactive pathway.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Also, in contrast to starvation, sleep deprivation is associated with a 100-fold increase in the T4-to-T3 conversion enzyme 5'-deiodinase type II in brown adipose tissue (3), which is consistent with experimental hypothyroidism (13, 61), further suggesting that central changes in regulation of anabolic hormones produce a state in which peripheral mechanisms show activities consistent with compensation.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	344	The clinical implications of suppression of these hormones are based on their many pleiotropic actions.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Deficiency in PRL, induced by hypophysectomy that reduces circulating PRL to 50% of control values, is associated with normocytic anemia, grossly reduced immunocompetence, decreased body weight, and several other abnormalities (49) shared by sleep-deprived animals.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	346	 GH has widespread effects on the growth and metabolism of most tissues, including by increasing DNA, RNA, protein synthesis, and mitosis (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Suppression of leptin would be expected to extend beyond the effects on energy balance to include numerous effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	348	 For example, leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice show many endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including decreased body temperature and immune defects (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Decreases in IGF-I would be expected to diminish some or many of its effector functions that include autocrine and paracrine growth factor mediation of mitosis, differentiation, chemotaxis, and apoptosis in many tissues (reviewed in Ref.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Administration of IGF-I during burn injury improves body weight and gut mucosal weight, stimulates mucosal DNA and protein content, and reduces the incidence of bacterial translocation (32).
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	351	 The endocrine and immune systems are intricately linked, and the hormonal changes may be contributing to decreased resistance to infectious disease in this animal model.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Deficiencies in GH, IGF-I, PRL, thyroid hormones, and leptin induced by sleep deprivation affect health and provide one explanation for the absence of localization of specific sleep deprivation effects.
0.1154272.14871886.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Low basal PRL and lack of reciprocal relationships between IGF-I and GH, and between leptin and corticosterone, point to the hypothalamus as a locus for sleep deprivation effects, where key factors interact before presentation of integrated signals to the pituitary.

0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A continuous low level basal AGRP-LI release was observed from hypothalami of rats fed ad libitum before the rats were killed.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Basal AGRP-LI release was 3-fold greater in rats fasted 48 h.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In fasted animals leptin dose-dependently suppressed basal AGRP-LI release.

0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These studies demonstrate that in the rat there are different levels of basal hypothalamic AGRP-LI release in fed and fasted states and that in the fasted rat this release can be profoundly suppressed by leptin.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These studies also suggest that AGRP is present in the systemic circulation of rats.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	18	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   AGOUTI-RELATED protein (AGRP) is an orexigenic neuropeptide produced by neuropeptide Y (NPY)-containing neurons in the medial portion of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that functions in the central control of feeding behavior (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Its mechanism of action appears to be the competitive antagonism of -MSH, a potent satiety-inducing agent produced by POMC-producing neurons located more laterally in the arcuate nucleus (2, 3, 4, 6, 7).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Pharmacological studies using the cloned melanocortin receptors (MCRs), have demonstrated that AGRP is a very potent antagonist of -MSH action at the MC3R and MC4R and that it also has some potency at the MC5R (6).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	21	Both the MC3R and MC4R are expressed within hypothalamic feeding centers.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Therefore, both of these MCR subtypes must be considered potential targets for AGRP action in central processes regulating food intake.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, while genetic and pharmacological models have firmly established the role of the MC4R in feeding behavior, the participation of the MC3R in these events can only been inferred from the distribution of its messenger RNA (mRNA) (5, 8, 9, 10, 11).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	24	Release of AGRP in the hypothalamus has not previously been examined due to the lack of a reliable RIA.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Therefore, factors affecting the acute release of AGRP have only been surmised from studies that have examined changes in the level of its mRNA under various conditions.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Factors presently known to alter AGRP mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus include fasting and leptin.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	27	 AGRP mRNA levels are increased in normal mice that are fasted and genetically obese mice that lack leptin (ob/ob) or its receptor (db/db) (1, 3, 7).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Administration of exogenous leptin to normal mice and ob/ob mice has also been shown to reduce AGRP mRNA levels (12).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	29	Because AGRP and NPY are produced by the same neuron (4), agents known to affect NPY synthesis and release might conceivably also influence the synthesis and release of AGRP.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Leptin has been shown to decrease NPY mRNA levels (13, 14).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, the acute effects of leptin on NPY release have been conflicting.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Leptin was reported to decrease NPY release from perfused hypothalami of lean Zucker rats (15).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In contrast, in vivo studies with Long-Evans rats failed to demonstrate an acute effect of leptin on NPY release from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the hypothalamic region believed to be the major site of release of NPY produced in the arcuate nucleus (16).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In other in vivo studies, the serotonin antagonist methysergide has been shown to increase NPY secretion and the 5-HT1B/2C receptor agonist m-CPP has been shown to reduce NPY protein levels in the PVN of the rat (17, 18).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Therefore, leptin and serotonin might be expected to have an acute effect on hypothalamic AGRP release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	36	In both the rat and human arcuate nucleus AGRP-NPY- and -MSH-containing neurons send projections to the lateral hypothalamus (19, 20).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This hypothalamic region contains neurons that produce the orexigenic agents melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin A and B.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This anatomical arrangement is consistent with the widely held concept that the arcuate nucleus provides important neurochemical input to the lateral hypothalamus.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, fibers from the lateral hypothalamic area have also been reported to project to the medial hypothalamus (21, 22).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This raises the possibility that the orexigenic agents produced in the lateral hypothalamus could reciprocally influence the release of NPY and AGRP from AGRP-NPY-containing neurons.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	41	To date the majority of investigations have focused on AGRP s orexigenic role in the hypothalamus.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to note that expression of AGRP mRNA has been reported in a number of other sites.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In humans and rodents, the adrenal glands (cortex and medulla), appear to be the site of the highest level of AGRP mRNA expression after the hypothalamus (1, 3).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	44	 AGRP mRNA has also been documented in the subthalamic nucleus, lung, and testis of humans and in rodents it has been reported in lung, kidney, testis, ovary, and muscle tissues (1, 3).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The function of AGRP in those extra-hypothalamic sites is presently unknown.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Although the distribution of MCRs in the peripheral tissues of humans and rodents has not been extensively studied, expression of several MCR subtypes sensitive to the action of AGRP has been reported in peripheral tissues.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Available data indicates that in humans and rodents MC3R and MC5R mRNA is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and/or pancreas (23, 24).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In rodents expression of MC5R mRNA has been reported in the adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, and lacrimal glands (23, 24, 25).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	49	Within the context of this information we sought to establish a RIA that could be used to further explore the central and peripheral actions of AGRP.

0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	216	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   In these studies, development of a specific AGRP RIA enabled us to examine several previously unexplored aspects of AGRP physiology.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The actual release of AGRP from the hypothalamus has not previously been reported, and using this RIA we were able to examine the effects of fasting on the basal release of AGRP and the effects of certain chemical messengers on that release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Second, the RIA allowed us to examine serum for the presence of AGRP and investigate the possibility that the adrenal gland was the source of that immunoreactivity.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This facet of our studies was prompted by the observation that the adrenal gland has the second greatest level of AGRP mRNA expression in the body (after the hypothalamus) and is a tissue known for the secretion of regulatory factors into the bloodstream.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	220	 At the inception of these studies, we hypothesized that adrenal AGRP might be secreted into the systemic circulation and act on peripheral MCRs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Although the serum levels of AGRP-LI we observe are within the physiologic range, the adrenal gland does not appear to contribute to that immunoreactivity.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	222	Specificity of the AGRP RIA To ensure the veracity of our findings we critically examined the specificity of our AGRP RIA.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Several lines of evidence support our contention that the RIA is specific.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	224	 First, in preliminary experiments we found a low ID50 [10 fmol/ml for AGRP (87 to 132)] and no cross-reactivity to a number of other peptides including -MSH, NPY, orexin B, leptin, and agouti protein.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The latter is most notable in that agouti protein shares with AGRP a very similar cysteine-rich C-terminal motif.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Moreover, the antibody recognizes AGRP s C-terminus [AGRP (87 to 132)], which is a portion of the molecule that is critical to bioactivity in pharmacological studies (6).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	227	Second, the concentrations of AGRP-LI observed in the tissue extracts listed in Table 1 correlate well with the levels of mRNA known to be present in those tissues.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	228	 For example, AGRP mRNA is expressed at its highest levels in the hypothalamus with the next highest level of expression in the adrenal glands (1, 3).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Consistent with that data, we observed that AGRP-LI was greatest in the hypothalamus followed by the adrenal gland.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Similarly, no AGRP mRNA has been reported in liver by Northern blot or PCR (1, 3) and consistent with those data no AGRP-LI was detected in extracted hepatic tissue.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In addition, the increase in basal release of hypothalamic AGRP-LI observed in fasted rats correlated with the increase in mRNA observed in similarly fasted rats.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	232	Third, the results of our chromatographic analysis strongly support the specificity of the RIA.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Both tissue and serum AGRP-LI eluted in a single peak close to the elution position of synthetic AGRP (87 to 132).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	234	 An important control in serum data were the observation that AGRP-LI eluted from the C18 environmental cartridge coeluted with serum applied directly to the C18 HPLC column in similar amounts.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This observation indicates that the only significant difference between the two assay methods (C18 cartridge vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	236	 C18 HPLC) is that the C18 cartridge results in significantly lower recovery of AGRP-LI.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Nonetheless, the cartridge method facilitates the analysis of multiple samples.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	238	Release of AGRP-LI from hypothalamic slices In these studies, we were able to confirm that release of AGRP-LI correlates with the changes in AGRP mRNA previously observed in fed and fasted states or with leptin administration (7, 12).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In our studies, we noted a 3-fold increase in hypothalamic AGRP-LI released from the hypothalami of 48 h fasted rats.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This change correlates nicely with the nearly 3-fold increase in AGRP mRNA observed in our studies (Fig.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	241	 However, the increase in AGRP mRNA observed in these rat studies are much less than the 15-fold increase in AGRP mRNA noted in the mouse (1, 7) and may reflect interspecies differences.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	242	 described a 91% reduction in AGRP concentrations in 10 day food-restricted rats and hypothesized that the marked reduction in AGRP (in a physiological state that might be expected to be associated with increased AGRP concentrations) was due to increased peptide release (27).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Although we did not measure static concentrations of AGRP-LI in 48 fasted rats, our results are consistent with their hypothesis of increased AGRP release in physiological states associated with hunger.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	244	In our experiments, we observed that the basal release of AGRP-LI from the hypothalamus varies with the nutritional state of the animal (fed vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	245	 We also observed that the fat hormone leptin has a profound influence on this release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This effect was most obvious in the fasted animals because their AGRP-LI levels are elevated.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The observed suppression of AGRP-LI by leptin in fasted rats is what one would expect from a hormone that provides feedback to the hypothalamus regarding the adequacy of nutritional intake.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	248	 We also observed a significant decrease of NPY release with leptin administration, which has previously been noted by Lee et al.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	249	 These data indicate that leptin concomitantly affects AGRP and NPY release from AGRP-NPY-containing arcuate nucleus neuron.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	250	While the present studies are unable to distinguish whether the observed AGRP-LI release is governed by the constitutive or regulated pathways (or released through both pathways), the fact that KCl depolarization caused a large release of AGRP-LI suggests that at least some AGRP is stored and released with the regulated pathway.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This is consistent with the notion that AGRP is an important regulatory neuropeptide and not merely a protein released constitutively from cells.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	252	Several pieces of data indicate that the observed leptin suppression of AGRP-LI release from the hypothalamus of fasted animals was a specific effect.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Importantly, the response was dose dependent and was not induced by any of the other peptide agents used in these studies.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In addition, a simultaneous inhibition of NPY release was observed which makes the likelihood of a nonspecific AGRP response less likely.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Thus, we hypothesize that the effect of leptin on AGRP-LI release is a result of the action of leptin on leptin receptors known to be present on the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron (7, 20).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, in our in vitro system the perfusate bathed the entire hypothalamus and the leptin-containing perfusate could have influenced the release of chemical messengers from other hypothalamic neurons expressing leptin receptors that also affect AGRP release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	257	 It is therefore conceivable that the leptin effect observed in these studies represents a summation response of the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Nonetheless, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that leptin is a predominant regulator of AGRP release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	259	Contrary to our expectations we found no increase in the release of AGRP-LI with the administration of orexin B from hypothalami of fed animals.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	260	 This was surprising in view of the work of van den Pol et al.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	261	 who found that arcuate nucleus neurons have nanomolar sensitivity to orexin and are capable of releasing GABA and glutamate from axons terminals adjacent to the AGRP-NPY-containing cell in response to orexin (28).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Electron microscopy studies performed by Horvath et al.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	263	 have also identified an abundance of presynaptic orexin-immunoreactive boutons abutting NPY-containing neurons (21).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	264	 This latter observation would strongly suggest the presence of orexin receptors on the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	265	We also had anticipated that MCH might have an effect on hypothalamic AGRP-LI release because MCH projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the arcuate nucleus have previously been observed (22).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	266	 However, it should be noted that the actual presence of MCH receptors on the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron has not, to our knowledge, been documented.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	267	That m-CPP did not cause a change in hypothalamic AGRP-LI release in fasted rats was also somewhat unexpected.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Because the hypophagic effect of serotonin is thought to be mediated by the serotonin 5HT1B/2C receptor, the observation that serotonin did not cause a change in AGRP-LI might be interpreted as consistent with the conflicting positive and negative effects of this biogenic amine on NPY release reported in the literature (17, 18).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, the lack of suppression of basal AGRP-LI release with the administration of the selective 5HT1B/2C agonist m-CPP could be construed as inconsistent with the data of Dryden et al.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	270	 who observed a decrease in NPY levels in the PVN (which was presumed to reflect an effect of m-CPP on the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron in the arcuate nucleus) with sc or ip administration of that agent (18).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Nonetheless, the in vivo model used in the latter study differs significantly from our perfusion model and, therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding this potential discrepancy.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	272	Several possible explanations exist for the lack of change in AGRP-LI in response to orexin B, MCH and m-CPP.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	273	 First we must acknowledge that the hypothalamic perfusion system itself might not be sensitive enough as a system to detect small changes in AGRP-LI release produced by these agents.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	274	 However, if this is the case, an important corollary might be that orexin B, MCH, and m-CPP are relatively weak regulators of AGRP.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	275	 We do not feel that the sensitivity of the RIA was an issue because the half-dose of AGRP (87 to 132) suggests that the assay should have been sensitive enough to detect reasonably small changes in AGRP-LI.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	276	A second possibility is that when orexin, MCH, and m-CPP are applied to hypothalamic slices they stimulate neurons bearing their receptors in other hypothalamic nuclei.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The summation response might not result in an observable change in AGRP-LI release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	278	A third possible explanation is that orexin B, MCH, and m-CPP do not directly affect the acute release of AGRP or NPY.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Rather, it is possible that these agents act by modulating the membrane potential of the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron and by this mechanism determine the subsequent response of the AGRP-NPY-containing neuron to agents such as leptin.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In this scenario, the effect of orexin B, MCH, and m-CPP on AGRP release would only be indirect and in our experimental model we would not observe a change in AGRP-LI release in response to of any of these three agents.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	281	 A similar lack of observable effect would occur if orexin, MCH, and serotonin acted by regulating the transcription of AGRP mRNA and subsequently influencing the pool of AGRP available to be released under physiological conditions such as decreasing serum leptin levels.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	282	Comparison of NPY and AGRP-LI release from hypothalamic slices Because AGRP and NPY are produced and released from the same arcuate nucleus neurons, we simultaneously examined AGRP-LI and NPY release from the perfused hypothalami of fed and fasted rats.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Similar to AGRP-LI release, a continuous basal NPY release was observed in both the fed and fasted state (Figs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	284	 NPY release was 80% greater from the hypothalami of 48 h fasted vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	285	 An increase of NPY release from PVN of food deprived rats has previously been reported (29, 30).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	286	 These latter studies suggest that the PVN is the predominant source of the NPY released from the perfused hypothalami in the present studies.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Comparing the percent increase in NPY and AGRP-LI release that occurred in fasted animals reveals that NPY release increased to a lesser degree than AGRP-LI (80% vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Similar to AGRP-LI release, NPY release from perfused hypothalami was inhibited by leptin and the time course of leptin-induced NPY suppression and recovery paralleled that of AGRP-LI (Figs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, leptin inhibition reached statistical significance sooner in the case of AGRP-LI release vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	290	 In addition, comparing the maximal inhibition of AGRP-LI and NPY release by 10-6 M leptin reveals that NPY release was inhibited to a lesser extent than AGRP-LI release (33% vs.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Although purely speculative, these data may indicate that leptin has a greater role in regulating AGRP release than NPY release and/or that leptin mediates its effects more through its regulation of AGRP release than through its regulation of NPY release.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The last two statements should be viewed with caution because the physiological consequences of the relative percent increases or decreases in release of the two agents cannot be determined from the present studies.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	293	Presence of AGRP-LI in adrenal tissue and serum Our studies indicate that the level of AGRP mRNA expression in adrenal tissue correlates well with the substantial stores of AGRP protein that we detected in that organ.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	294	 On the basis of wet tissue weight the adrenal has approximately 16% of the AGRP protein observed in the hypothalamus of the fed rat.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	295	Our chromatographic characterization of AGRP-LI suggests that AGRP is present in the systemic circulation at slightly less than nanomolar concentrations in the fed animal and increases to slightly more than one nanomolar in the 48 h fasted rat.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	296	 However, the origin of serum AGRP-LI detected in our studies remains a crucial and unresolved question.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Our adrenalectomy experiments indicate that adrenal AGRP is unlikely to be the source of serum AGRP-LI.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The results of those experiments would also suggest that adrenal AGRP is likely to have an as yet unidentified paracrine role in adrenal physiology.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	299	One potential source for serum AGRP-LI could be the hypothalamus.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In the rat, AGRP-containing fibers have recently been noted to project from the arcuate nucleus through the median eminence to the posterior pituitary, where it conceivably could be released into the systemic circulation (7).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In this regard, it is important to note that no compensatory increase in hypothalamic AGRP mRNA was seen in adrenalectomized animals.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	302	 This is certainly consistent with the lack of change in the serum concentration of AGRP-LI observed in those animals.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, more direct studies would be required to conclude that hypothalamic AGRP actually reaches the systemic circulation.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	304	Despite the fact that the origin of serum AGRP-LI is unclear, the levels of AGRP-LI observed in rat serum are potentially in a physiological range.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Although purely speculative, AGRP in the bloodstream would likely function as a modulator of peripheral MCR activity in tissues such as the pancreas or gastrointestinal tract that contain receptors sensitive to its actions.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	306	 The concentration of AGRP found in rat serum is close to the IC50 of AGRP (87 to 132) observed in our pharmacological studies of the cloned human MC3R (approximately 1 nanomolar) (6).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	307	 However, AGRP (87 to 132) has a much lower affinity for the human MC5R, another peripherally expressed MCR that could be a potential target of serum AGRP.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In this regard, we have not examined the binding affinity of AGRP at the rat MC3R and MC5R.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Species differences in ligand binding affinity are not uncommon and the binding affinity of AGRP could be quite different at the rat receptors.
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The recent identification of the mahogany protein, which is postulated to be a low affinity receptor for agouti protein, may also have relevance for this discussion (31, 32).
0.088994086.10830275.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Whether mahogany protein or a similar molecule exists that functions to increase local concentrations of AGRP in peripheral tissues is presently unknown.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this study, we address the hypothesis that orexin A acts in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to increase nonfeeding-associated physical activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	7	 PVN-cannulated rats were injected with either orexin A or vehicle during the light and dark cycle.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Feeding behavior was assessed by VTR.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Regardless of the time point of injection, orexin A (1 nmol) was associated with dramatic increases in SPA for 2 h after injection (orexin A: 6.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	20	OBESITY AFFECTS ONE-THIRD of the American population and is the second leading cause of death in the United States after smoking (1).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Treatment of obesity has proven difficult, and this intractability may be due to the fact that energy balance is regulated through multiple and complex mechanisms that are not fully understood (4).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Maintenance of body weight is achieved by an intricate balance between energy intake and expenditure.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We found that changes in nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) mediate resistance to weight gain with overfeeding in sedentary adults (32).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is evidence that "spontaneous" physical activity (SPA) is familial (63) and shows marked interindividual differences in its contribution to daily energy expenditure (49); however, the mediator of the interaction between overfeeding and physical activity is unknown.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	25	Orexins (A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2) are recently identified neuropeptides synthesized exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus, an area classically believed to be a crucial "feeding" center (25).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Initial interest in these neuropeptides concentrated on their orexigenic actions, since central injection of orexins increased food intake, and prepro-orexin mRNA was shown to be upregulated with fasting (50).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Apart from appetite regulation, orexins have been implicated in the central nervous system (CNS) regulation of arousal and sleep, cardiovascular function, temperature, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, pituitary secretion, glucose homeostasis, and gastric acid secretion (17, 37, 48, 51, 53, 58).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (12) reported that, following intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A, hypothalamic c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was highly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and orexin A injected directly into the PVN stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These authors suggested that the PVN might not be the primary site of action of the orexins in their orexigenic role; rather, the orexins might perform some other role via the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The PVN is demonstrated to be one of the sites innervated by orexin-containing neurons (39, 44) and to express orexin receptor 2 (36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	31	These observations intrigued us, and we wondered whether spontaneous physical activity (SPA) is not random but rather intricately regulated in the CNS.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, we would propose that the interaction between overfeeding and physical activity undergoes processing within the hypothalamus due to its role in energy homeostasis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	33	In this study, we address the hypothesis that orexin A acts on the PVN to increase SPA independently of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Our approach was to inject orexin A into the PVN and measure SPA, thermogenesis, and feeding behavior by use of arrays of infrared activity sensors, indirect calorimetry, and infrared 24-h videotaping.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Additionally, we observed effects of the orexin receptor antagonist (selective for orexin 1 receptor, OX1R) SB-334867 injected into the PVN.

0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We proposed that a potential mediator of SPA is orexin A.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Furthermore, we thought that orexin A might mediate this effect via the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	193	 To address the hypothesis that orexin A in the PVN mediates SPA, we injected rats with orexin A or vehicle control and monitored SPA by use of infrared beams and videotape recording.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The data demonstrated that orexin A, in all the animals where the cannula was sited in the PVN, was associated with dramatic increases in SPA for 2 h after the injection.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	195	 After these 2 h, SPA did not return to baseline, but the animals appeared to compensate and become more sedentary than controls for the next 1-3 h.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Increases in SPA for 2 h after injection were dose dependent.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In incorrectly cannulated rats, no increase in SPA was observed after the orexin A injection.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	198	 These data demonstrate a potential role for orexin A at the PVN in SPA and moreover demonstrate that SPA may be intricately modulated through neurohumoral factors in the hypothalamus.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	199	To establish the specificity of the effect of orexin A at the PVN, we observed the effect of orexin receptor antagonist SB-334867 injected into the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Decreases in SPA followed the antagonist injection, and it partially blocked the effect of orexin A on both SPA and thermogenesis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	201	 SB-334867 has a 50-fold higher affinity for the OX1R than for the OX2R (11).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In the rat brain, differential expression of OX1R and OX2R has been reported, and OX2R was predominantly expressed in the PVN (36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	203	 OX1R is considered to be a selective receptor for orexin A, and OX2R is considered to be a nonselective receptor for both orexin A and orexin B.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Despite lower affinity at OX2R, high concentration of SB-334867 at the site, the PVN, might attenuate the effect of orexin A via block of OX2R; however, because it was also reported that intraperitoneal injection of this compound attenuated orexin A-evoked grooming (11), selective OX2R antagonist is needed to verify the role of the receptor subtype in the effect of orexin A at the PVN.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	205	Our data are consistent with other observations regarding the neurohumoral role of orexin A.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Central orexin systems may be critical regulators of sleep/wake states based on neuroanatomic and genetic data (7, 8, 13, 34, 41, 44).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Specifically, orexin A may activate arousal centers (17).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Our observations that PVN-injected orexin A induces SPA are compatible with the fact that orexin A acts to maintain the waking state (47).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The behaviors that we observed in response to orexin A injection were consistent with wakefulness, namely, intense grooming, face-washing behavior, and rearing and searching activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Several reports also describe an immediate increase in grooming, face-washing activity, and locomotor activity after intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A (17, 21, 22, 24, 38).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Additionally, there are reports showing the relationship between endogenous orexin and locomotor activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	212	 (27) showed that orexin A release into cerebrospinal fluid was higher during active waking than in quiet waking in cats.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	213	 (15) reported that Fos expression in orexin neurons correlated with locomotor activity in rats.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	214	 (18) showed that genetic ablation of orexin neurons in mice resulted in a decrease in spontaneous motor activity and that these transgenic mice became obese despite hypophagia.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These reports also strongly suggest that orexin plays a role in regulation of SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	216	Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is suggested to be involved in orexin A-induced behaviors (21), because it is known that grooming behavior is closely associated with environmental stress (16), and intracerebroventricular administration of orexin A increases plasma corticosterone (17, 31) and adreno-corticotropin levels (23, 52).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Intracerebroventricular administration of CRF increased grooming behavior (30) and intracerebroventricular administration of -helical CRF, a CRF antagonist, blocked the orexin-induced behaviors, specifically grooming and face washing (22).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In terms of brain concentration, CRF is synthesized mainly in the PVN (55), and this peptide is also thought to be integral to energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The PVN is one of the sites densely innervated by orexin-containing neurons and expresses OX2R (8, 36, 62).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Thus our results are consistent with the thesis that orexin A stimulates these specific behaviors via CRF.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The dopaminergic system is also suggested to mediate the orexin A-induced activity and grooming behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Involvement of the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic system in intraventricularly administered orexin-induced hyperactivity in rats has been demonstrated (38).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Further study is needed to determine the downstream pathways of orexin A-induced hyperactivity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	224	It is known that orexin A injected into the PVN induces feeding.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	225	 However, our data demonstrate that PVN-injected orexin A induced feeding behavior only when it was injected early in the light cycle when feeding behavior was minimal in control animals.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	226	 There was no relation between the magnitude of orexin A-induced SPA and duration of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In other words, PVN-injected orexin A can increase SPA without induction of feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This elevation in activity without concomitant feeding behavior is consistent with our previous studies examining the effect of orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus, another brain site integral to energy homeostasis (20).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The early-light cycle feeding induced by PVN-injected orexin A in this study is in agreement with data from others indicating that orexin A injected into the ventricles and into the lateral hypothalamus stimulates feeding only during the light cycle (20, 67).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The reason why stimulation of feeding after orexin A injection occurs only during the light cycle remains unclear.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	231	 It has been demonstrated that for orexin A injected into the lateral hypothalamus there is a twofold greater feeding response to orexin A in food-restricted rats, which have a high level and rate of feeding (60).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Thus level and/or rate of feeding are unlikely to be related to the lack of feeding after orexin during the dark cycle.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	233	 (14) reported that orexin A-induced (icv administration) feeding was largely circadian dependent and that orexin A-induced increase in grooming was moderately circadian dependent.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These authors suggested the possibility that the increase in feeding appeared to largely reflect the wake-increase actions.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Other reports regarding orexin A injection into the PVN have shown variable results (10, 12, 56).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	236	 (12) reported that PVN-injected orexin A (0.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	237	3 nmol) stimulated food intake, although this effect was not powerful.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	238	 (10) showed that 1 nmol of orexin A injected into the PVN stimulated food intake, but they reported no other behavioral effects than feeding and drinking.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Differences in dose of orexin A (0.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	240	03-1 nmol, injected under light cycle in all reports) and the generally moderate effect of orexin A on feeding may explain the discrepant results in feeding response between these three reports.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	241	 In the present study, we injected 1 nmol of orexin A and observed increased feeding when it was injected in the early light cycle, and we also observed remarkably increased physical activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This observation contrasts somewhat with that of Dube et al.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	243	; however, they did not examine SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We recorded animals' behavior by using videotaped recording and quantified their activity by using arrays of infrared activity sensors.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Our results suggest that orexin A in the PVN acts predominantly to increase nonfeeding physical activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	246	Levels of SPA in humans cluster in families (63) and for mice within strains (5).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	247	 These observations suggest that identifiable genetic components may exist to account for variance in NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Additionally, we observed NEAT to increase with positive energy balance (32).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Recently, decreased plasma orexin A levels in obese individuals was demonstrated (2).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Because orexin A can pass the blood-brain barrier (26), peripheral orexin A levels might reflect its CNS levels.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In the mouse hypothalamus, age-related decline in OX2R messenger RNA levels has been shown (59), and it is known that old rats have decreased activity (43).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The decline in orexin with obesity and aging may support the hypothesis that orexin A in the PVN is a mediator of NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Lubkin and Stricker-Krongrad (35) reported that intracerebroventricular injection of orexin A resulted in an increase in metabolic rate that was not dependent on an increase in activity in mice.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	254	 We measured O2 consumption and CO2 production by indirect calorimetry.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Increased O2 consumption accompanied increased activity and the thermogenic response to orexin A, which clearly tracks the orexin A effect on SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus we consider the increase in O2 consumption and thermogenesis to be a result of the increase in SPA associated with orexin A.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The reason for this contrast may be due to differences in injection site between studies; site-specific injections reach a much more limited receptor population than ventricular injections.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	258	 With a ventricular injection, it is unknown where injectate ultimately and predominantly reaches; thus effects observed could result from stimulation of receptors at multiple locations.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	259	Unlike neuropeptide Y, a potent orexigenic and hypothermic signal with a clearly defined pattern in energy balance states, orexin A activity in energy balance states appears to be more complicated.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Some studies show no difference in orexin A activity after fasting, (3, 45, 65), whereas others show elevated orexin expression or activity after fasting (50, 66, 69).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Orexin A activity during states of positive energy balance has not been thoroughly tested.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	262	 One study showed that high-fat feeding increased gene expression of orexin A (64), which is consistent with our hypothesis of increased orexin activity with positive energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, studies of obese animal models show either decreases in orexin A expression or activity (6, 54, 68) or no change (57, 61).
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	264	 These conflicting data likely represent the complicated role of orexin A in energy balance: although orexin administration stimulates feeding, it also elevates activity, perhaps predominantly, which enhances thermogenesis.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Therefore, one cannot simply place orexin A in the class of obesity-promoting neuropeptides on the basis of its feeding-stimulatory properties.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This is clearly illustrated by the data from Hara et al.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	267	 (18), who demonstrated that loss of orexin A activity resulted in an obese animal model.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Although these animals ate less, they were also much less active.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The obese state of the animals in this study indicates that the decreased energy expenditure brought about by the loss of orexin A function was clearly more potent than the hypophagia in affecting energy balance.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Thus, although the present data and those of others (18, 64) indicate that positive energy balance may stimulate orexin A, further studies examining endogenous orexin A activity in lean and obese animal models during overfeeding paradigms will help to determine what role orexin A plays in modulating NEAT.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	271	In summary, injection of orexin A into the PVN dramatically increases SPA.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The increase in SPA for 2 h occurs regardless of the time of injection.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The effect of orexin A on SPA appears to be predominantly through an increase in general activity.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	274	 However, we concur with others that orexin A via the PVN also stimulates feeding behavior.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Orexin A therefore appears to be a neurohumoral mediator of SPA, NEAT, and feeding.
0.2210986.14656716.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Its role in the physiology of energy balance requires further investigation.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	11	WHY WE SLEEP IS A LONG-STANDING question that modern neuroscience is still unable to answer.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying different aspects of sleep physiology.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We now know most of the neuronal substrates, neurochemical messengers, and regulatory processes involved in initiating and maintaining sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	14	 How can we further our understanding of sleep toward its function? Can molecular genetics bring new insights? Here, we first give a historical perspective on the genetics of sleep and then continue to review the available methods for the genetic dissection of sleep as an experimental approach that can be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art electrophysiological, neuroanatomic, and pharmacological techniques already used with great success in sleep research.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We also caution against making premature interpretations of molecular findings of complex traits that should only be attempted within the general physiology of an intact organism.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	17	Before the introduction of molecular biology, genetic studies of traits or phenotypes was based on either the observation of a resemblance between related individuals or crossing experiments between experimental individuals carrying divergent phenotypes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Simple laws have been discovered, according to which simple monogenic autosomal or recessive phenotypes segregate and are inherited on the basis of the assumptions of their molecular substrates, i.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, these types of traits are far less prevalent than those that cannot be attributed to the influence of single genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Nevertheless, shortly after the introduction of electroencephalography (EEG), Vogel (82) was one of the first to notice that even a complex phenotype like the EEG is under strong genetic control.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Segregation analysis in pedigrees carrying rare EEG variants was concordant with classical genetic laws, suggesting the presence of single gene effects (83-85).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Results from twin studies also indicated that the EEG patterns of monozygotic (MZ) twins have a much higher resemblance than those of dizygotic (DZ) twins or unrelated subjects (33, 82, 92), again confirming that this highly complex functional brain phenotype might be tightly controlled by genes and little (if any) affected by environment.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	23	The study of the genetics of sleep can be approximately dated back to a publication by Geyer in 1937 (26) in which he reported on a higher concordance between sleep habits of MZ twins than DZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Gedda (23) reported rare cases of concordant long sleepers (up to 15 h) in MZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Gedda and Brenci (24) first estimated that the heritability (percentage of variance explained by the additive effects of genes) of sleep duration is over 30%.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These authors later confirmed that sleep duration is highly similar in twins living apart (25), discounting the influence of possible environmental effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	27	 More recent observations in twins indicated that even the pattern of rapid eye movements present higher concordance between MZ than between DZ twins (8) and that between 40 and 50% of the variance in sleep duration and the presence of a sleep disorder can be accounted for by genetic effects (30, 50).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Zung and Wilson (94) performed the first polygraphic sleep recordings in twins in 1966; they found the temporal sequence of sleep stages to be almost completely concordant between MZ twins.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Between 1983 and 1998, detailed polygraphic analyses were performed in twins; all of these studies reported surprising similarities between MZ twins (31, 39-41, 87).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Experimental genetics of sleep in mice was pioneered by Valatx in the early 1970s.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Over a time span of 15 years, Valatx's group (72-77) conducted several crossing experiments and recorded sleep in hundreds of inbred, recombinant inbred (RI), and hybrid mice, mainly to follow the segregation of paradoxical sleep (PS) amount.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These studies, together with a diallelique (reciprocal crossing between several inbred strains) sleep experiment in mice performed by Friedmann (22), clearly indicated that, although some aspects of sleep may follow a simple segregation, the classical genetic laws cannot predict most others.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	34	Although these now classical genetic sleep studies favor a strong genetic basis for sleep, we still have no clue about possible molecular mechanisms.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The first attempts to identify the molecular basis of sleep have been based on the assumption that there must be genes that change their expression according to the behavioral state (sleep vs.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	36	 wake) and/or time spent in a particular state.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Closely related examples come from the circadian field where dramatic changes in the expression of several clock genes occur according to a strict circadian pattern (reviewed in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The two-process model of sleep regulation (10), by its remarkable predictions on the homeostatic aspects of sleep, motivated the first molecular investigation of sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Because sleep need and intensity are homeostatically regulated, deprivation of sleep should lead to a change in the expression of those genes, of which the product(s) is necessary for recovery or is (at least) involved in sleep regulation.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	40	 (54) performed the first substractive hybridization in sleep-deprived vs.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	41	 control rats and isolated several clones with increased or decreased relative expression, among which neurogranin and dendrin were later identified (47-48).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The sleep-deprivation paradigm has since become the method of choice in gene expression experiments aimed at uncovering molecular bases of sleep regulatory processes (reviewed in Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Our laboratory (56) has already discussed several conceptual problems of this approach.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In summary, there are two major limitations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	45	 First is the fact that the expression of many genes varies with vigilance state rather than themselves being actively involved in vigilance state regulation.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This weakness of correlative gene expression can only be overcome by confirming the involvement of the identified genes by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Second, the very high complexity of mammalian brain mRNA populations is a technical limitation; however, this can be overcome by recent developments in gene expression profiling (see below).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Nevertheless, the identification of cortistatin and orexin (12, 13) with specific actions on sleep shows that gene expression investigation can be highly successful.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	49	Transgenic methods based on random gene integration and homologous recombination gave rise to a strong hope to uncover the molecular bases of many phenotypes, including the most complex ones.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These techniques can be used to address the consequences of overexpression, ectopic expression, time- and tissue-specific expression, and gain or loss of function of a candidate gene.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Potential advantages and problems have been addressed in several reviews (for a recent review, see Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	52	 With the exception of the orexin/hypocretin system (see below), to the best of our knowledge not a single gene manipulation has been performed specifically to investigate its consequences on sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, many investigators in the field benefit from the availability of such transgenic models to answer sleep-related questions.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The accumulated results indicate that all transgenic mice studies published thus far (see Table 1) report some sleep-related abnormalities, strongly suggesting either the nonspecific effects of gene manipulations and/or the complex integrative nature of sleep that makes it highly sensitive to many physiological changes.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	58	The most straightforward approach is to consider a candidate gene based on previous evidence of its implication in sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	59	 As indicated above, sleep physiology and pharmacology studies have identified most of the essential systems from which candidate genes can be chosen.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	60	 With the use of this approach, studies of the differential expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (53), growth hormone-releasing hormone (6), interleukin-1 (43), somatostatin (63), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (5) have shown that all of these play a potential role in sleep.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Sleep studies in transgenic mice (Table 1) have also used this approach.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This powerful approach can also be combined with more recent techniques for gene identification.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The major disadvantage of this approach is that obviously nothing new can be learned in terms of sleep gene discovery.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic neuropeptides acting on orexin 1 and 2 receptors and first thought to be involved in feeding behavior (13, 55).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Mignot's group (38) identified, through linkage analysis and positional cloning, mutations in the orexin 2 receptor gene as the cause of canine narcolepsy, an animal model of human sleep disorder narcolepsy.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Independently and almost simultaneously, Yanagisawa's group (7), who were interested in the role of orexins in feeding behavior, discovered in the mouse a phenotype similar to canine and human narcolepsy after a targeted deletion of the preproorexin gene.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	68	 More recently, the orexin system has also been implicated in the etiology of human narcolepsy; narcoleptic patients have undetectable orexin A levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (49), and in a small number of postmortem cases a dramatic reduction in the number of orexin-containing neurons was observed in the hypothalamus (51, 65).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	69	 These unexpected observations led Sakurai's group (29) to generate the first transgenic mice to specifically investigate the role of the orexin system in vigilance states.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	70	 These transgenic mice carry the promoter of the human preproorexin gene ligated to a truncated human ataxin-3, a gene that can induce cell death.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	73	 However, although the causal implication of the orexin system in narcolepsy is now established, its direct and causal involvement in normal sleep regulation, as is often claimed (3, 14, 28, 34, 64, 89, 91), remains to be elucidated.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	75	The systematic search for genes affecting a particular phenotype needs to cover the whole genome of an organism.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The genome-wide search or mapping experiments make no a priori assumptions on gene systems involved; although this approach may lead to already known physiological mechanisms, its strength is that unknown and/or unexpected systems may be discovered.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The orexin success story in canine narcolepsy is the unique and the best example of this approach in the field of sleep research.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Therefore, genome-wide search constitutes the method of choice if we are to discover new "sleep genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	79	The fundamental basis of this approach is the linkage disequilibrium between closely localized genes.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	80	 If a gene is affecting a trait, there must be in addition to this gene other genetic material tightly linked to it and segregating from generation to generation together with the trait under study.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Therefore, instead of testing all genes of an organism to check for cosegregation with a trait (linkage), one needs to test only a small panel of genes at regular intervals throughout the genome to obtain sufficient information on the large chromosomal pieces that are transmitted as a single unit.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	82	 To follow the segregation of genes, they must be polymorphic (nucleotide variation from individual to individual); this may not be the case, or the sequence of the gene may be unknown.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A powerful substitute is provided by highly polymorphic elements (restriction fragment length polymorphisms or RFLPs, simple sequence length polymorphisms or SSLPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, and so forth), mostly found in the noncoding genetic material.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The more polymorphic markers are tested, the more accurate the mapping will be.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	85	 A major question is how big the effect of a gene should be to be detected.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	87	, the monogenic autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy), whereas natural variations in genes controlling complex traits may have only subtle effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Therefore, genome-wide approaches to dissect complex traits should be highly sensitive to detect all genes with variable effects on the trait.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	89	Basically, two major approaches are available: mutagenesis and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The mutagenesis approach is straightforward: a mutagen like N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea is used to mutate at random the whole genome; this is followed by high-throughput screening of all mutant offspring to detect a major effect on a given phenotype.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Both dominant and recessive mutations can be screened in the same way as a single gene mutation in a pathological condition.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Once the mutated gene is localized, candidate gene or positional cloning approaches are used for its identification, and ultimately its functional analysis can be performed by gain or loss of function.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The remarkable demonstration of this technique is provided by the isolation of Clock, one of the key mammalian circadian clock genes (1, 35, 81).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, genetic screens in this approach are for fully penetrant dominant and recessive mutations and therefore cannot identify small-effect sequence variations that may turn out to be essential for some aspects of the phenotype.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In addition, with currently available technologies, recording and analyzing sleep of thousands of mice in a mutant screen does not seem feasible, at least not in a single academic laboratory.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	96	 QTL analysis has been proposed as a powerful approach in the genetic dissection of complex traits (11, 17, 36).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Although natural allelic variation of genes with small effect can be mapped through QTL analysis, the final identification of sequence variants (quantitative trait nucleotides or QTNs; Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	98	 42) in the QTL region with biologically significant effects on the phenotype may represent prohibitive efforts in terms of both phenotyping and genotyping.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	99	 An excellent example of how QTL analysis can further our understanding of complex traits was recently provided by Takahashi's group (57) for the circadian behavior in mice.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Although most of the molecular machinery of the circadian timekeeping system has been discovered mainly by direct molecular techniques and mutagenesis, the identified genes do not explain the complexity of the observed circadian behavior.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	101	 For instance, none of the clock genes has been found to be involved in the approximately 1-h difference in free-running period between BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Takahashi's group (57) used QTL analysis in a BALB/c  x  C57BL/6 (CXB) intercross and discovered several new loci with epistatic interaction.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	104	The complex nature of sleep is reflected in high intra- and interspecies phenotypic variability.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	105	 For instance, the 24-h amount of sleep shows highly significant differences between inbred mouse strains (21, 22, 74).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	106	 We have shown that AKR mice sleep ~3 h more than DBA mice over a 24-h period (21).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	107	 As for the differences in the period of circadian rhythms, not a single gene but many genes with complex interactions may be found to account for this difference.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	108	 We therefore initiated a series of experiments to dissect different phenotypic aspects of sleep in mice through QTL analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Table 2 summarizes the main quantitative aspects of sleep for those inbred strains of mice that differed the most.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Note that most differences between high and low strains are consistent between the two studies performed 25 years apart (usually, differences between two extreme strains expressed in standard deviations are twice as large in Ref.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Basically, two inbred mouse strains differing in the trait of interest are crossed and their F1 offspring are either intercrossed to generate F2 or backcrossed to one of the progenitor strains to generate backcross populations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Further random intercross or backcross generations can be performed to generate advanced intercross and backcross populations.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	118	 To generate RI sets, F2 mice are brother  x  sister mated until full homozygosity, thereby "fixing" unique sets of recombinations in several inbred lines.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Heterogeneous stocks are generated by intercrossing several inbred mouse strains over many generations and therefore represent higher rates of recombination and polymorphism useful for fine mapping (44, 63).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Although RIs are usually not suitable for QTL mapping due to their limited progenitor strains and number, for QTLs of large effects, they may provide significant mapping accuracy because of the fourfold increase in recombination compared with a F2 population (11).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Also, for complex phenotypes with high variability, the use of RIs is advantageous because several individuals per strain are tested instead of, for example, a single F2 animal.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Therefore, as a first step, we have performed QTL analysis in two RI sets.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In seven CXB RIs, QTLs were identified for the amount of PS on chromosomes 5, 7, 12, and 17 (61).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Toth and Williams (71) conducted a similar study in 13 CXB RIs and reported provisional QTLs on chromosomes 4, 16, and 17 for the amount of PS during the light period.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Because of a small number of CXB RIs (n = 7-13), none of the QTLs identified could satisfy standard significance levels (37).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Also, the discrepancy between the two referenced works indicates that, as in any linkage study, replication is needed, especially when the findings are based on a limited number of animals and/or strains (for a recent review, see also Ref.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	127	 QTL analysis in 25 C57BL/6  x  DBA/2 (BXD) RIs identified the first significant QTL for the amount of PS in the 12-h light period on chromosome 1 (60).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	128	 We have estimated in BXD RIs that between 40 and 60% of variance in sleep amounts can be accounted for by the additive effects of 6-15 genes, confirming a polygenic basis for differences in sleep amounts.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	150	Another aspect of the sleep EEG, with considerable importance for its homeostatic regulation, is the change in delta power (i.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	151	, EEG power in the 1- to 4-Hz range) as a function of the prior wakefulness duration.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Relative delta power can be used to index both sleep need and sleep intensity in all mammalian species studied so far.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Sleep loss induces a proportional and predictable increase in delta power, which differs significantly between inbred mouse strains (18, 21).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We have used the delta power rebound after a 6-h sleep deprivation to map the underlying genes in BXD RIs (18).

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	157	 These two examples suggest that quantitative sleep EEG parameters are under stronger genetic control than sleep amounts; therefore, these are more suitable for quantitative genetic dissection.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These large regions may contain a single major gene or several genes with small effects.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Also, QTLs may interact with each other (epistasis), an effect that is difficult to detect in QTL mapping experiments.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The first step is to make sure that the region contains QTLs of large enough effect.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	166	 One possibility is to transfer the QTL region from one inbred strain background to another inbred background through repeated backcrossing and selection to make a congenic strain.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	167	 We have reviewed sleep amount data available in eight congenic strains generated by transferring minor histocompatibility genes from the inbred strain BALB/c to the inbred background of C57BL/6 (60).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In almost all cases, the results indicated that, even if the transferred pieces of chromosomes contained a large-effect QTL detected in CXB RIs, a clear effect could not be observed in the resulting congenic strain.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This finding strongly suggests that 1) many genes are involved, 2) they are in interaction (epistasis), and 3) even if a major QTL is identified, its effect may vary from genetic background to genetic background due to the action of modifier genes (45).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Once the QTL region is verified, the next step is to finely map the QTL down to the smallest chromosomal region (11, 17), amenable to candidate gene analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The final identification of functional QTNs (sequence variants) is the most difficult part, since QTNs may be found every few kilobases.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Therefore, a combination of several approaches is necessary for mapping and candidate gene analysis.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	173	 High-resolution QTL mapping in conjunction with future developments in high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping and the availability of whole genome sequences of several major mouse strains should identify candidate genes to be investigated.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	174	 All of those candidate genes can then be mutated either by classical homologous recombination (knockout) or by the newly developed serial nested chromosomal deletions (59).
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Systematic crosses between increasing and decreasing QTL allele and the complete set of mutants should physically identify the functional QTN.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Because most QTNs will probably be involved in gene regulation rather than being mutations affecting the protein function, further gene expression profiling with high-throughput genotyping technologies (e.
0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	177	, microarray or TaqMan) and gene translation and posttranslational protein analyses should be used to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved.

0.42022583.11842076.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Considering that we still know very little about the molecular basis of sleep and how ineffective the current treatments for common sleep disorders such as insomnia or hypersomnia are, we believe that molecular genetic approaches are still our best hope for developing better therapies and uncovering sleep functions.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hypocretin (orexin) peptides are involved in the regulation of energy balance and pituitary hormone release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by disruption of hypocretin neurotransmission.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Pituitary LH secretion is diminished in hypocretin-deficient animal models, and intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in rats.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We evaluated whether hypocretin deficiency affects gonadotropin release in humans.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To this end, we deconvolved 24-h serum concentrations of LH and FSH in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic males (N) and seven controls (C) matched for age, body mass index, and sex.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Basal plasma concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were similar in both groups.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mean 24-h LH concentration was significantly lower in narcolepsy patients [3.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	10	01], which was primarily due to a reduction of pulsatile LH secretion [23.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	11	9 (C) U l to 1 24 h to 1, P = 0.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The orderliness of LH and FSH secretion, quantitated by the approximate entropy statistic, was greater in patients than in controls.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In contrast, all other features of FSH release were similar in narcoleptic and control groups.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Also, LH and FSH secretions in response to intravenous administration of 100  microg of GnRH were similar in patients and controls.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These data indicate that endogenous hypocretins are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis activity in humans.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In particular, reduced LH release in the face of normal pituitary responsivity to GnRH stimulation in narcoleptic men suggests that hypocretins promote endogenous GnRH secretion.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	18	NARCOLEPSY IS CHARACTERIZED by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis (30).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	19	 It is caused by the progressive loss of hypocretin neurons in the brain (28, 31).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Hypocretin neuronal cell bodies are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus/perifornical area (41), but axonal projections throughout the central nervous system predict diverse biological actions (7).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Indeed, hypocretin peptides 1 and 2 (also called orexin A and B) appear to affect feeding behavior and energy expenditure, arousal, autonomic outflow, and a variety of neuroendocrine ensembles (9, 10, 43, 49).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Therefore, apart from its well-recognized neurological manifestations, the clinical syndrome of hypocretin deficiency in humans may encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral, endocrine, and metabolic anomalies.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In keeping with this postulate, we recently identified aberrations of the pituitary-adrenal and somatotropic ensembles and circulating leptin concentrations in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men (15, 17, 29).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	24	The septal preoptic and arcuate nuclei are among the many brain sites receiving hypocretin inputs (7, 26, 32, 46).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These nuclei are involved in the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (50).

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Also, hypocretin-1 promotes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in hypothalamic explants from male rats (40), and intracerebroventricular administration of anti-hypocretin antibody completely abolishes the preovulatory LH surge in intact female rats (14).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Thus the available data suggest that endogenous hypocretin peptides stimulate LH release in rodents.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It is currently unknown whether these peptides exert analogous effects in humans.

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Deconvolution analysis (47) was used to estimate the four secretory and clearance measures of interest: 1) the number and locations of secretory events; 2) the amplitudes of secretory bursts; 3) the durations of randomly dispersed LH and FSH secretory bursts; and 4) the endogenous single-component, subject-specific plasma half-lives of LH and FSH.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	72	 It was assumed that the gonadotropin distribution volumes and LH and FSH half-lives were time and concentration invariant.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The following parameters were calculated: half-duration of secretory bursts (duration of the secretory burst at half-maximal amplitude), hormone half-life, burst frequency, amplitude of the secretory burst (maximal secretory rate attained within a burst), mass secreted per burst, basal secretion rate (only for LH), pulsatile secretion rate (product of burst frequency and mean burst mass) and total secretion (sum of basal and pulsatile).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Based on recent validation studies in men, deconvolution analysis was carried out at 95% joint statistical confidence intervals for all calculated LH and FSH amplitudes (13, 25).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The univariate approximate entropy (ApEn) statistic was developed to quantify the degree of irregularity, or disorderliness, of a time series (33).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Technically, ApEn quantifies the summed logarithmic likelihood that templates (of length m) of patterns in the data that are similar (within r) remain similar (within the same tolerance r) on next incremental comparison and has been formally defined elsewhere (34).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The ApEn calculation provides a single nonnegative number, which is an ensemble estimate of relative process randomness, wherein larger ApEn values denote greater irregularity.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Cross-ApEn (X-ApEn) quantifies joint pattern synchrony between two separate but parallel time series after standardization (z-score transformation) (36, 38).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In the present analysis, we calculated X-ApEn assuming r = 20% of the SD of the individual time-series and m = 1; hence, use of the designation X-ApEn (1, 20%).

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	140	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   This study shows that the average 24-h plasma LH concentration is reduced in hypocretin- deficient narcoleptic men, whereas gonadal steroid hormone levels are normal.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The reduction of the plasma LH concentration in narcoleptics is accounted for by a diminution of pulsatile LH release (by 30% compared with healthy controls), which cannot be attributed to insensitivity of the pituitary gonadotrophs to GnRH stimulation.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	142	 LH burst frequency and burst mass were reduced in narcoleptic men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In contrast, plasma FSH concentrations and various features of FSH secretion were similar in narcoleptics and controls.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	144	These data suggest that endogenous hypocretin peptides stimulate pulsatile LH release in men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In particular, the fact that spontaneous LH secretion is blunted, whereas pituitary responsiveness to GnRH stimulation is intact in narcoleptic subjects, suggests that hypocretin deficiency primarily inhibits hypothalamic GnRH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This inference agrees with studies in male rats showing that hypocretin-1 promotes GnRH release from hypothalamic explants (40).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Moreover, hypocretin inputs are abundant in the preoptic area that contains many GnRH neurons (50), which coexpress hypocretin-1 receptors and are in direct contact with hypocretin fibers (3).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These physiological and anatomical observations obviously support the notion that hypocretin peptides are involved in the regulation of GnRH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The fact that FSH secretion is not diminished (whereas LH release is) in narcoleptic subjects may imply that hypocretins specifically modulate GnRH burst frequency, as LH secretion is particularly enhanced by high-frequency bursts, whereas low-frequency bursts predominantly promote FSH release (20).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	150	ApEn quantitates the relative orderliness or reproducibility of subordinate (nonpulsatile) secretory patterns in neurohormone time series and reflects feedforward and feedback adjustments driven by (patho)physiological changes in interglandular communication.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In view of the unchanged testosterone feedback signal in the patients, the increased LH and FSH regularity and increased synchrony of both hormones might reflect a diminished GnRH input signal with unchanged pituitary responsiveness toward this neurohormone (48).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	152	Alternatively, hypoleptinemia may blunt LH release in narcoleptic patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We have previously shown (15) that the plasma leptin concentration is considerably reduced in narcoleptic men.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Leptin has emerged as an important modulator of the HPG axis (5).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Indeed, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are hypogonadotropic and sterile, and recombinant leptin administration rescues these defects in ob/ob males (24) and females (6).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Moreover, the circadian rhythm of plasma leptin levels is synchronous with that of LH concentrations (18), and the reduction of LH secretion induced by fasting in the rat and in humans can be reversed by leptin administration (1, 4, 8).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	157	 These data indicate that leptin stimulates LH release and that genetic and/or physiological alterations of circulating leptin levels can impact pituitary gonadotropin release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In this context, it is conceivable that the reduction of the plasma leptin concentration in narcoleptics (15) is involved in the diminution of pituitary LH release in these patients, but it should be mentioned that we could not demonstrate a (linear) correlation between mean circulating leptin concentration and LH production.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	159	Notwithstanding the diminished LH production, testosterone concentration was unchanged in patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Recently, it has become clear that leptin is involved in the (local) regulation of testosterone synthesis and secretion in the male rat gonad (44).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Direct evidence for such action in humans is not available, but an inverse relation between serum testosterone and leptin has been demonstrated (19).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Therefore, the inhibitory effect of leptin on testosterone (and adrenal hormone) secretion might be relevant in narcoleptic patients, because narcoleptics exhibit a 50% reduction in circulating leptin concentration, which may unleash gonadal testosterone secretion to compensate for diminished LH drive (15).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The finding of an inverse relationship between testosterone and leptin in our subjects reinforces this view.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	164	Prepro-orexin mRNA and the orexin receptors are expressed in various endocrine and nonendocrine tissues (11), and, for instance, orexins can modulate directly human and porcine adrenal stereoidogenic function (21, 27).

0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Activation of the OX1 receptor stimulates testosterone secretion, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a physiological (modulating) role of the orexin system in concert with leptin and ghrelin at the testicular level (45).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The significance of these findings for human physiology needs to be explored.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, OX1 and OX2 receptor expression was demonstrated in the male human reproductive system, including the testis, suggesting that orexins can directly impact gonadal hormone release in humans as well as in rodents (12).
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	169	The impact of the alterations in the HPG ensemble described here on the fertility of narcoleptic men remains to be definitely determined.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Some early reports have suggested that narcolepsy is associated with impaired fertility (39), but since then these suggestions have not been confirmed, as far as we are aware.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Moreover, it is not our clinical impression that narcoleptic (male) patients are less fertile, and gonadal hormone concentrations in plasma were normal in narcoleptics despite the reduction of LH levels.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Thus it seems unlikely that the partial hypogonadotropism observed here has clinical sequelae.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Nevertheless, in view of our findings in males, it is warranted to investigate narcoleptic females across the menstrual cycle for putative defects in ovarian function.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	174	In conclusion, hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic men have reduced circulating LH levels, which are brought about by a diminution of pulsatile LH release.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In contrast, FSH secretion is normal in these patients.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The pituitary sensitivity to GnRH stimulation is normal in narcoleptics, which suggests that a reduction of hypothalamic GnRH release underlies their blunted LH secretion, and in accordance with this view is the increased orderliness of secretion of gonadotropins.
0.4064973.15172887.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Both hypocretin deficiency per se and hypoleptinemia may be involved in changes in the HPG axis in narcoleptic males.

0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this study, we examined the interaction between PrRP and the adiposity signal, leptin, which interacts with a number of peptidergic systems in the brain to regulate energy homeostasis.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Intracerebroventricular coadministration of 4 nmol PrRP and 1  microg leptin in rats resulted in additive reductions in nocturnal food intake and body weight gain and an increase in core body temperature compared with each peptide alone.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We show also, by quantitative in situ hybridization, that PrRP mRNA is reduced in fasted male rats and obese Zucker rats, indicating that PrRP mRNA expression, like that of other anorexigens, may be regulated by leptin.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Finally we show, using immunohistochemistry, that greater than 90% of PrRP neurons in all regions where PrRP is expressed contain leptin receptors.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, we provide evidence for PrRP neurons forming part of the leptin-sensitive brain circuitry involved in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis.

0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Although it was shown to cause PRL release from cultured pituitary cells (1), the lack of immunoreactive fibers in the external region of the median eminence suggested that it does not act as a typical hypophysiotrophic hormone (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These findings have been reinforced by a number of studies, which question PrRP s role in the modulation of PRL release in vivo and in vitro (6, 7, 8, 9).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	15	 PrRP neurons are located in the dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and ventrolateral medulla (VLM) (2, 10, 11), regions that are known to be involved in the regulation of food intake (for reviews, see Refs.

0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Ob-R is expressed by neurons that contain peptides known to be involved in the regulation of food intake.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the hypothalamus Ob-R is coexpressed with NPY (29), agouti-related peptide ( 30), POMC (31), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (32), and orexin/hypocretin ( 33, 34), thus providing morphological evidence for an action of leptin on neurons containing these orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Leptin has also been shown to interact with a number of these peptides in vivo to modulate food intake or mRNA expression (32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39).

0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Studies in vivo show that coadministration of PrRP and leptin caused an additive effect on reductions in food intake and body weight (Fig.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	157	 We have demonstrated previously, using pair-feeding experiments, that the reduction in body weight caused by PrRP cannot be explained solely by the reduction in food intake, and is likely to include an effect on energy expenditure (14).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Here we show that the hyperthermic responses to PrRP and leptin, which are an indirect measure of increased energy expenditure, were also additive (Fig.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The interaction between these peptides appears to be additive rather than synergistic as the effect induced by coadministration of the two peptides was equivalent to the sum of the peptides administered alone.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This additivity demonstrates that the effects of one peptide are not mediated by the other but does not define the level of interaction.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	161	 At the present time, there are no known antagonists to the GPR10/hGR3 or leptin receptors, which would enable further clarification of this interaction.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	162	The reduction in PrRP mRNA expression in fasted, male rats provides further evidence that PrRP is an anorexigen.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This confirms our previous result in fasted female rats (14) and removes the complication of hormonal fluctuations because some studies report variations in PrRP mRNA levels according to the stage of the estrous cycle (46).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We report also that PrRP mRNA is reduced in obese Zucker rats in each of the three areas of the brain where PrRP is expressed.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This phenomenon has been reported for a number of other anorexigenic peptides including cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (32), POMC ( 47), and CRH (48).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The reduction in PrRP mRNA in the models of energy imbalance used in this study may indicate that PrRP mRNA expression is regulated by leptin.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	167	 We have localized leptin receptor immunoreactivity in PrRP neurons, which demonstrates that the regulation of PrRP mRNA could be achieved by a direct action of leptin on PrRP neurons.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	168	In addition to containing Ob-R, PrRP neurons of the NTS and VLM also contain TH, as has been shown previously by others (3, 10, 43, 44, 45).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The location of the PrRP neurons mainly in the caudal brainstem makes it likely that they are noradrenergic, rather than adrenergic, neurons.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	170	 It has been reported recently that almost all TH-positive cells in the A1 and A2 regions express Ob-R immunoreactivity (49).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This, combined with our findings indicating high levels of colocalization of PrRP with Ob-R and TH, suggests the presence of a subpopulation of noradrenergic neurons that express PrRP and Ob-R.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Retrograde tracing studies have shown that the PrRP neurons of the NTS and VLM project to the hypothalamic PVN (44), where PrRP-immunoreactive fibers are detected (2).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The PVN contains a major population of neurons containing the anorexigen, CRH, which has been reported to mediate some of the effects of leptin (50, 51).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Thus, CRH neurons of the PVN may act as a point of convergence between various leptin-sensitive systems.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	175	 We have shown that the peripheral satiety signal, cholecystokinin (CCK), activates PrRP neurons in the brainstem (15).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Recent interest has focused on the ability of leptin to enhance the effects of CCK and vice versa (52, 53, 54).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Although some of this cooperativity occurs at the level of the gut (55, 56), our results suggest that PrRP neurons in the brainstem may be another point of interaction of leptin on the CCK-mediated satiety pathway.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	178	In summary, our studies suggest that PrRP interacts with leptin in the regulation of food intake and metabolism.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The expression of PrRP mRNA is reduced in obese Zucker rats and fasted rats, indicating that leptin may be regulating PrRP s expression.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In addition, leptin receptors are present on PrRP neurons in the DMH, NTS, and VLM, providing morphological evidence for a direct interaction.
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	181	 As with PrRP, a number of peptides that are coexpressed with Ob-R in hypothalamic neurons have been shown also to interact with leptin (29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).
0.08830947.11796488.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Together, these data support the notion that leptin acts throughout the entire brain circuitry involved in appetite and body weight regulation.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	3	 SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   Both obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are complex disorders with multiple risk factors, which interact in a complicated fashion to determine the overall phenotype.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In addition to environmental risk factors, each disorder has a strong genetic basis that is likely due to the summation of small to moderate effects from a large number of genetic loci.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Obesity is a strong risk factor for sleep apnea, and there are some data to suggest sleep apnea may influence obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	6	 It is therefore not surprising that many susceptibility genes for obesity and OSA should be shared.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Current research suggests that approximately half of the genetic variance in the apnea hypopnea index is shared with obesity phenotypes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Genetic polymorphisms that increase weight will also be risk factors for apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition, given the interrelated pathways regulating both weight and other intermediate phenotypes for sleep apnea such as ventilatory control, upper airway muscle function, and sleep characteristics, it is likely that there are genes with pleiotropic effects independently impacting obesity and OSA traits.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Other genetic loci likely interact with obesity to influence development of OSA in a gene-by-environment type of effect.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Conversely, environmental stressors such as intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation produced by OSA may interact with obesity susceptibility genes to modulate the importance that these loci have on defining obesity-related traits.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	13	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA), a disorder characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, is one of the most common respiratory disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 24% and 9% among middle-aged American men and women, respectively (92).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Obesity in modern Western society is also extremely common.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	15	 As of 2002, nearly one-third of US adults met clinical criteria for obesity, and this prevalence appears to only be increasing (27).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	16	That obesity and OSA often colocalize is of no surprise.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Other than perhaps male gender, obesity is the strongest risk factor for the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Relative to those with a stable weight, a 10% increase in weight over 4 yr is associated with a sixfold increase in the risk of developing moderate to severe OSA (58).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Weight loss trials have found significant reductions in apnea severity with moderate weight loss (69, 74).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the mechanisms by which obesity causes OSA are not completely defined, with many potential pathways hypothesized (93).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Perhaps the most obvious is that fat deposition in the neck and airway lumen may lead to increased collapsibility of the upper airway.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, adiposity in the chest and abdomen may result in reductions in lung volumes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recent studies suggest reduced lung volume may independently predispose to upper airway collapse (37).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Another possible mechanism relating obesity with sleep apnea is via the hormonal effects of adipose tissue.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Leptin, a hormone produced by adipose tissue, has important effects on weight regulation by stimulating hypothalamic satiety centers (6, 34, 57).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Human obesity is typically associated with elevated leptin levels, suggesting a state of leptin resistance (15).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Besides regulating weight, leptin may have important effects on ventilatory drive.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Leptin-deficient mice hypoventilate and have a blunted response to hypercapnia (53, 84).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Administration of leptin corrects these abnormalities independent of changes in weight (53).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Through these effects on ventilatory control, elevated leptin levels (or the underlying leptin-resistant state) may play a pathogenic role in the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	31	It is also possible that OSA may play a causal role in the development of obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	32	 OSA patients have elevated leptin levels compared with weight-matched controls, and OSA treatment lowers these levels (39, 53, 55).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These findings suggest OSA may be a cause of leptin resistance and thus a propensity for further weight gain.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Not only does sleep disruption, a common result of OSA, reduce serum leptin levels, it also increases levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin (76, 82).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These findings were associated with increases in hunger and appetite scores (76).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Epidemiological studies consistently implicate reduced sleep as a risk factor for the development of obesity (36, 47, 70, 82, 87, 89).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Although overall weight does not appear to fall with treatment of OSA, one study did find the amount of fat inside the abdominal cavity (visceral fat) diminishes (10).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This fat compartment appears to have unique hormonal effects as the amount of visceral adipose tissue is more strongly associated with metabolic complications of obesity such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than measures of subcutaneous fat or overall obesity (28, 29).

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	41	 A large twin study estimated the heritability of weight to be 78% (79).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	42	 That is to say, 78% of the variability in weight across a population is explained by shared intrafamilial factors.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Subsequent studies demonstrated that adopted children have a body size more closely resembling their biological parents than their adopted parents (80).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Studies in Finland and the United Kingdom have estimated the heritability of body mass index (BMI) to be 60 to 80% (42, 61).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Linkage to obesity-related phenotypes has been investigated in some 50 genomewide scans to date with dozens of candidate loci and genes identified (3, 59).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	46	Similarly, familial factors have been known to influence OSA risk for nearly 25 years (77).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Since then, several groups have quantified the familial risk of OSA by studying widely different populations.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	48	 All of these studies have identified a strong heritable component to OSA (30, 32, 49, 62, 66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Family-based studies suggest that the risk of OSA is approximately twice as great among relatives of apneic persons (30, 66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, a dose-response relationship exists such that the risk of OSA increases with increasing number of apneic relatives (66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Quantitative apnea-related phenotypes also demonstrate substantial heritability.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	52	 A study of elderly twins found the heritability of both the respiratory disturbance index and the oxygen desaturation index to be nearly 40% (7).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	53	   SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES TOP ABSTRACT FAMILIAL AGGREGATION OF OBESITY.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	54	 SHARED SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES GENE x ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FUTURE DIRECTIONS GRANTS REFERENCES   Given the strong genetic components to both obesity and apnea phenotypes as well as the tight association with multiple interweaving links between these two diseases, it would not be surprising for there to exist common susceptibility genes for both obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In fact, it has been suggested that the familial aggregation of OSA may simply be a reflection of that found in obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Even after controlling for BMI, significant familial aggregation for OSA persists (32, 66).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Furthermore, a study of nonobese apneic patients also demonstrated strong heritability of OSA (49).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	58	 That this should be the case should be of no surprise given that other pathophysiological pathways to apnea development such as craniofacial structure and ventilatory control have also been demonstrated to have a heritable component (13, 32, 49, 63, 65).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Thus the susceptibility genes for OSA are not exclusively the same genes as those modulating obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	60	 That does not mean, however, that no overlap exists.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	61	Clearly, given the strong effect of obesity on OSA pathogenesis, any genetic variant that predisposes to obesity will secondarily also lead to the development of OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Thus any obesity gene might also be considered to be an apnea gene.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, obesity is not a monolithic process.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Clearly, there are some forms of obesity that have a more important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	65	 For example, fat deposition in the neck is much more important than fat deposition in the limbs (17).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	66	 An android fat deposition pattern (excess subcutaneous truncal-abdominal fat) and visceral adiposity have also been found to more closely predict OSA than overall obesity (31, 72).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Therefore genetic polymorphisms that influence fat deposition in these sites will be more important OSA genes.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	68	 There is a wealth of evidence that these fat distribution pattern phenotypes are genetically driven.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Large differences in the patterns of fat deposition exist across inbred strains of cattle, suggesting an important role for genetics (83).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Among humans, even after correction for overall obesity, measures of fat deposition pattern aggregate within families.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The ratio of subscapular skinfold thickness to subscapular plus suprailiac thicknesses, a measure of the android fat pattern, has been reported to have a heritability of 43% (71).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Measures of central obesity such as BMI-adjusted waist circumference and ratio of trunk to extremity skinfold ratio have heritabilities of 29 to 48% (40).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	73	 These findings strongly support the hypothesis that there are genetic polymorphisms that specifically promote fat deposition in the subcutaneous regions of the torso or around the abdominal viscera.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Through this mechanism, these variants would promote the development of both obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	75	Another type of potential genetic interaction between obesity and OSA is one in which a particular polymorphism leads to both obesity and OSA through independent mechanisms (Fig.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	76	 For example, by impacting leptin function, a genetic polymorphism may reduce satiety and also increase ventilatory instability.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This is what is referred to as genetic pleiotropy.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Pleiotropic genetic effects have clearly been described in other situations.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	79	 A well known example is at the APOE locus, which codes for apolipoprotein E.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The 4 allele of APOE is an important risk factor for both atherosclerotic heart disease as well as Alzheimer s dementia (24, 91).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The circadian regulatory gene, CLOCK, also appears to influence multiple biological systems.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	82	 CLOCK-knockout mice have profound disruptions in circadian rhythmicity, and so it is not surprising that these animals would have abnormal timings for feeding and activity (88).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In addition, however, these mutant animals demonstrate an overall increase in caloric intake associated with a phenotype of obesity and metabolic syndrome (85).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Similarly, given the large number of neurological, metabolic, and mechanical overlaps between obesity and OSA, it is likely that a polymorphism affecting one biochemical system may affect the risk for both disorders via multiple paths.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	85	 For example, disruptions of the orexin system could potentially result in a common link between obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus play an important role in sustaining wakefulness with projections to all of the wake-promoting areas of the brain (21).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Loss of these neurons is associated with a narcolepsy phenotype (60).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These neurons, as the name orexin implies, also play an important role in stimulating appetite, projecting on to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (68).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Thus mutations affecting orexin, the orexin receptor, or proteins involved in the downstream signaling of orexin binding might simultaneously affect metabolic and sleep-related function.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Several other potential candidate genes are listed in Table 1.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Both obesity and sleep apnea are heavily influenced by underlying genotype.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Some susceptibility genes act directly on one phenotype and through the causal relationships between obesity and sleep apnea have indirect effects on the other.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Other loci have pleiotropic effects, impacting susceptibility to both obesity and sleep apnea via independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Candidate genes that might link the genetic mechanisms of obesity with sleep apnea through either pleiotropy or gene x environment interactions.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	96	  The recently reported linkage scans from the Cleveland Family Study represent the first genomewide linkage studies of OSA phenotypes (54, 55).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The results provide insight into possible genetic overlaps between obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Linkage to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as a measure of OSA and BMI as a measure of obesity was tested across the autosomal chromosomes in both a Caucasian and an African-American cohort.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The heritability of AHI in both groups was 33%, whereas the heritability of BMI was over 50%.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	100	 After controlling for BMI, significant heritability for AHI remained, supporting the notion that the genetic susceptibility to OSA is not completely defined by weight.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In further multivariate modeling of a larger subset of the Cleveland Family Study, obesity measures such as BMI and serum leptin explained 50 to 55% of the genetic variance in AHI (56).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This suggests that about half of the genetic determinants of AHI are obesity related and half are obesity independent.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	103	Linkage findings are described by the logarithmic odds (LOD) score, a measure of the odds ratio of linkage to no linkage.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Although none of the linkage findings in either racial group achieved genomewide significance (LOD  >  3.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	105	3) (46), there were several regions with intermediate LOD scores, indicative of possible linkage in the setting of complex, multifactorial diseases such as obesity and OSA (90).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Furthermore, the change in linkage evidence for AHI after adjustment for BMI provides insight into mechanisms of action if a susceptibility locus is present.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Among the Caucasians, a LOD score of 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	108	7 for BMI on chromosome 12p (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	109	 After adjustment for BMI, the maximal LOD for AHI in this region dropped to only 0.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	110	4 whereas the LOD for BMI adjusted for AHI fell to 0.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	111	 These data suggest that if a susceptibility gene for AHI exists in this region, it likely mediates its effect on apnea via obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	112	 On the other hand, a maximal LOD for AHI of 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	113	4 was found on 19q with no linkage evidence for BMI in this region (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Adjustment for BMI had no effect on the AHI LOD, suggesting that a susceptibility gene in this region exerts its effect on AHI through obesity-independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	115	A different pattern of linkage findings was found at the short arm of chromosome 2.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Among the Caucasians, the maximal LOD for AHI is 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	117	1 in this region, again suggesting that a susceptibility locus for both phenotypes might exist in this region (54).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, adjustment for BMI only dropped the LOD for AHI to 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	119	3, suggesting that the obesity effect at this locus does not fully explain the apnea effect.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This may represent two independent loci, one influencing AHI and one BMI.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Another possibility is that there is only one locus at 2p regulating both AHI and BMI but via independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	122	 A strong candidate gene for both phenotypes in this region is proopiomelanocortin (POMC).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	123	3, encodes for a number of hormones including melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	124	 POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are important in energy homeostasis via MSH.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Leptin s anorexic activity is mediated via depolarization of these neurons, and use of an MSH agonist decreases both body fat and leptin levels in humans (16, 25).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Obesity phenotypes have been consistently linked to the POMC locus (14, 33, 38, 67), haplotypes in this gene have been associated with leptin levels (38, 50), and severe mutations in this gene produce a severe childhood obesity phenotype (44).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Leptin s effects on ventilatory drive in mouse models are also mediated via MSH, suggesting that this pathway may independently predispose to apnea as well (64).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	128	Evidence for pleiotropy also exists at chromosome 8q.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Among African-Americans in the Cleveland Family Study, the peak LOD scores were 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	130	6 for AHI and BMI, respectively (55).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Again, after controlling for BMI, the AHI LOD only dropped to 1.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	132	1, suggesting that the obesity and apnea promoting effects in this region were independent.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	133	 A potential candidate locus in this region is the COH1 gene at 8q22 to 23.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This gene encodes a transmembrane protein with a presumed role in vesicle-mediated sorting and intracellular protein transport on the basis of its structure (43).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Severe mutations in this gene have been associated with Cohen syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition characterized by truncal obesity (9).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Other findings include facial dysmorphism, mental retardation, and ocular anomalies.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The craniofacial abnormalities include microcephaly, facial hypotonia, and laryngomalacia, all of which could predispose to OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Thus mutations in this gene that are milder but more common may play a role, via separate pathways, in contributing to nonsyndromic forms of both obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	139	The serotoninergic system is another common pathway that could link obesity and OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Serotonin has important effects on the stimulation of satiety centers in the arcuate nucleus (5).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In addition, serotonin potentiates hypoglossal neural output, which increases upper airway dilator muscle activity (45, 75).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Thus reductions in serotoninergic activity, by increasing appetite, could promote obesity and, by lowering muscle tone in the upper airway, could promote OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Both linkage and haplotype association studies in a Finnish population suggest a serotonin-related gene at Xq24 is associated with obesity (51, 81).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The SLC6A14 gene encodes for a sodium chloride-dependent transporter of neutral and cationic amino acids, which appears to play an important role in the transport of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, into the central nervous system (73).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	145	 A French study has confirmed the association of this polymorphism with obesity, and an association with hunger and satiety scores was also found (19).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Whether this polymorphism is associated with OSA (via or independent of any obesity effects) has not yet been studied, as the OSA linkage scans reported thus far have not included the sex chromosomes.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Each of the methods by which obesity predisposes to OSA can be influenced by an individual s underlying genetic susceptibility.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	150	 An increase in fat deposition around the upper airway will be more likely to produce apnea in individuals with a lower ability to respond to this stressor due to reduced upper airway dilator muscle tone.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Conversely, obesogenic effects of OSA may be influenced by the underlying genetic milieu.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Genetic polymorphisms may modulate the effect that exposure to sleep fragmentation from OSA has on leptin and ghrelin dynamics.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Sleep apnea susceptibility genes may interact with obesity through numerous mechanisms to influence sleep apnea predisposition.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Genetic polymorphisms may modulate the degree to which obesity alters ventilatory drive, reduces lung volume, or narrows the upper airway.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Other polymorphisms may affect the degree to which these stresses result in the development of sleep apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Similarly, obesity susceptibility genes may interact with sleep apnea in its potential effect on obesity.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	159	  The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPARG) gene located on chromosome 3p25 encodes a protein that is a key component of a nuclear transcription factor important in adipocyte differentiation (4).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Variants in this gene have been implicated as risk factors for the development of obesity (4, 18, 20, 48, 86).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Because hypoxia is known to suppress PPARG gene transcription (94, 95), the importance of a mild defect in PPARG function may become magnified in the setting of recurrent exposure to hypoxia from OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Thus PPARG allelic variants may play a much more important role in determining obesity phenotypes in individuals with OSA, and OSA may play a much more important role in promoting weight gain among those with a mutation in PPARG.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	163	Similarly, the effects of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and UCP2, two other obesity candidate genes, may be influenced by OSA.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These genes encode for uncoupling proteins, mitochondrial proton channels that divert energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis (2).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In so doing, their activation increases energy consumption.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Polymorphisms in both genes have been associated with obesity phenotypes (8, 12, 22 to 23, 52).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Interestingly, sleep deprivation in rodent models has been shown to increase expression of both UCP1 and UCP2 (11, 41), suggesting the sleep disruption of OSA may influence expression of these genes and thus the relative importance of a variant at these loci in determining obesity risk.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Although obesity is clearly a strong risk factor for OSA, further research is needed to better define any potential risk OSA carries for promoting weight gain.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Both diseases also clearly have a strong genetic basis.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although work has begun to identify the specific genetic polymorphisms that confer risk to the development of these disorders, clearly much more needs to be accomplished in this arena.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	173	 A recent workshop sponsored by the American Thoracic Society laid out recommendations for future research aimed at dissecting the genetic bases for sleep-disordered breathing (78).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	174	 A chief objective was the development of novel phenotypes, including biomarkers, that more closely reflect only one or a few molecular pathways rather than the overarching syndrome defined with the AHI.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	175	 These simpler phenotypes could be more amenable to genetic analysis because of the fewer sources of variance than a global measure of apnea.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The same holds true for obesity research, where the use of more specific phenotypes of fat deposition patterns would provide not only better insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity but also a better understanding of how obesity and OSA interrelate.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	177	The use of dense single nucleotide polymorphism maps will allow for better resolution of linkage findings so as to narrow down candidate loci.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	178	 A better understanding of the neurobiology and molecular pathways underlying obesity and sleep apnea will also allow for a more rational selection of candidate genes to test for association with these disorders.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Ultimately, the use of gene-knockout animal models will be important to establish causality of any identified associations.

0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Methodology for conducting bivariate linkage scans has already been developed, and there is evidence to suggest that such a strategy is more powerful than traditional univariate approaches (1).
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Not only will many genetic variants influence the development of OSA by causing obesity or vice versa but it is likely that there are also variants with pleiotropic effects predisposing to obesity and OSA via independent mechanisms.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Identifying such genes and understanding their function will provide novel insights into the shared pathogenesis of these diseases.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Finally, the possibility that genetic polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility that each disease confers toward the other should not be ignored.
0.18602495.16160021.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Incorporating such a model of gene x environment interaction into future study designs along with an understanding of the effects of obesity on OSA can allow for a better delineation of OSA susceptibility genes and vice versa.

0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The differential mRNA expression of orexin receptor subtypes in peripheral organs indicates discrete peripheral effects of orexins and the existence of a peripheral orexin system.

0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Moreover, the sexually dimorphic expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands suggests gender-specific roles of orexins in the control of endocrine functions.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	19	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   THE NEUROPEPTIDES OREXIN A and orexin B have been identified as endogenous ligands for an orphan seven-transmembrane receptor and were shown to stimulate food intake when injected into the brain ventricle (1).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Orexin A and B derive from the same precursor, prepro-orexin, which is selectively expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area, a region involved in the control of feeding behavior.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Prepro-orexin is identical with prepro-hypocretin, which was identified independently by directional tag PCR subtraction as an mRNA species specifically expressed in the rat hypothalamus (2, 3).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	22	Orexin (hypocretin)-immunoreactive fibers project to various brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, limbic system, locus coeruleus, and brainstem, and to the spinal chord (4, 5, 6, 7).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The orexin receptor subtypes OX1 and OX2 are also widely expressed in the rat brain, and the expression patterns are in good agreement with the distribution of orexin-immunoreactive fibers (8).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Based on the widespread projections of orexinergic neurons and functional considerations on the innervated brain areas, the involvement of orexins in the control of functions other than feeding behavior was proposed, including the control of neuroendocrine systems and the autonomic nervous system.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Subsequently, orexins were shown to increase plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels and to reduce plasma PRL and GH levels when injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) (9, 10, 11).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Furthermore, icv injected orexin increased or reduced plasma LH levels in female rats depending on the status of ovarian steroids (12, 13).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, icv or intracisternally injected orexin increased mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and plasma catecholamine levels (14, 15, 16).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, in dogs, mice, and humans the orexin system seems to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of narcolepsy (17, 18, 19).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	29	To date, orexins were considered to be exclusively synthesized in the brain (20).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, recent results indicated endocrine effects after peripheral administration of orexins (21, 22, 23).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	31	 On the other hand, iv injected orexin A is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (24), and the sites of peripheral orexin generation and the distribution of orexin receptor subtypes are not yet established.

0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	190	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Our present data demonstrate for the first time the expression of OX1 receptor mRNA in the thyroid, jejunum, gonads, and kidney and that of OX2 receptors in the lung.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In addition, we confirmed recent results showing the presence of OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNA in pituitary and adrenal (31, 32) of rats.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found the highest peripheral OX1 receptor mRNA expression in pituitary and the highest OX2 receptor mRNA expression in adrenal (4-fold higher than in brain).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Furthermore, we detected profound differences between male and female rats in these tissues.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	194	The expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors in pituitary and adrenal indicates a possible role of orexins in the regulation of endocrine systems, in particular of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The effects of icv injected orexins on plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone have been shown previously (9, 10, 11).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Our present results indicate that orexins may also regulate pituitary and adrenal hormones by direct action on these organs.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The localization of OX2 receptor mRNA in the zona glomerulosa and reticularis of the adrenal cortex supports the finding by Malendowitz et al.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	198	 (22) of increased plasma corticosterone levels after sc injection of orexins and enhanced corticosterone secretion from dispersed rat adrenocortical cells by orexins.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Recent results also demonstrated the stimulatory effect of orexin on the release of cortisol from human adrenal glands (33).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	200	 As we found high levels of OX2 receptor mRNA, but could not detect OX1 receptor mRNA in the rat adrenal gland by in situ hybridization and only very low OX1 receptor mRNA levels by the highly sensitive real-time PCR, the effects of orexins on corticosterone synthesis and release in rats might be mediated mainly via the OX2 receptor.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	201	Orexins have been shown to decrease tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels and dopamine release from the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line (30), and OX1 as well as OX2 receptor-like immunoreactivity has been found in the adrenal medulla of rats (31).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In contrast, we could not detect orexin receptor mRNA in the adrenal medulla by in situ hybridization.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	203	 However, there may be low levels of orexin receptor mRNA in the adrenal medulla, and beside the stimulation of corticosterone release orexins may influence adrenal catecholamine synthesis and release.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	204	The described effects of orexins on plasma levels of pituitary hormones such as ACTH, GH, PRL, and LH occurred after the injection of orexins into the brain ventricles, and these effects are most likely mediated via the corresponding releasing hormones (9, 11, 12, 13).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Plasma TSH levels decreased after iv injection of orexin (34).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, this effect may not be a direct effect on the pituitary, but appears to arise from inhibition of TRH secretion in the hypothalamus (34).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus, the physiological roles of orexin receptors in tissues such as pituitary and thyroid as well as in lung and kidney remain unclear, and further series of experiments will be needed to address the local effects of orexins in these tissues.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	208	Interestingly, we found much higher levels of OX1 receptor mRNA in the pituitary and of OX2 receptor mRNA in the adrenal of male compared with female rats.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Conversely, hypothalamic OX1 receptor mRNA levels were higher in female rats.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Hypothalamic orexin A content is higher in female rats (35), and the effect of orexins on LH release depends on estrogens (12, 13).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Thus, sex steroids not only affect the content and actions of orexin, but also may differentially regulate the expression of orexin receptors.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	212	We also show the expression of prepro-orexin mRNA in rat testis.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	213	 indicated the existence of prepro-orexin in rat testis (1).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Beside its occurrence in the rat brain, orexin A was found in tissue extracts of rat testis, but not other peripheral tissues (36).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Other groups, however, had been unable to detect prepro-orexin (prepro-hypocretin) or orexin A in peripheral rat tissues, including testis (3, 35).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These discrepancies may be explained by the different sensitivities of the assays used.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Using highly sensitive RT-PCR we were able to detect prepro-orexin mRNA in rat testis.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Interestingly, we did not find prepro-orexin mRNA in rat ovaries.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Thus, in peripheral tissues orexins appear to be synthesized exclusively in testis.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	220	 On the other hand, compared with those in brain, prepro-orexin levels in testis were low, and in situ hybridization experiments using oligonucleotide antisense probes failed to reveal significant amounts of prepro-orexin in testis (our unpublished observation).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Thus, the functional relevance of testicular prepro-orexin synthesis remains to be clarified.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	222	Prepro-orexin mRNA was not found in other peripheral tissues expressing orexin receptors.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Therefore, it is unlikely that in these organs orexins act in an autocrine/paracrine manner.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The presence of orexin A in human plasma (37) has been recently described, and we also detected comparable concentrations of orexin A in rat plasma.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Thus, circulating orexin may activate orexin receptors in peripheral tissues.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The source of plasma orexin remains unclear.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	227	 As we did not find differences between male and female rats in plasma orexin A levels, it is uncertain whether plasma orexins originate from testis.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	228	 On the other hand, orexin-containing neurons project to the median eminence and pituitary (32), and orexin may be released into the circulation from the pituitary.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As orexin A is relatively slowly metabolized after iv injection (24), a low rate of secretion should be sufficient to contribute to substantial plasma concentrations of orexin.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The lack of gender differences in plasma orexin levels and the comparatively low prepro-orexin mRNA expression in testis indicate a predominant role of hypothalamic orexin production.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Another possibility to stimulate peripheral orexin receptors could be the action of peptides other than orexin.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	232	 NPY, for example, has been shown to act at the cloned orexin receptor (38), and NPY is locally produced in the adrenal gland (39).
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	233	In summary, we have shown a sexually dimorphic expression of prepro-orexin and orexin receptor subtypes in various peripheral tissues and propose the existence of a peripheral orexin system.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Such a system may be involved in the regulation of endocrine and physiological functions that remain to be determined.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The localization of OX2 receptor mRNA in the rat adrenal cortex indicates a role in adrenal steroid synthesis and/or release.
0.29009572.11459774.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Our results represent the basis for further physiological studies addressing possible peripheral orexin effects.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results indicate that orexins may regulate both BAT energy expenditure and thermogenesis through their dual effects on sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In particular, orexin B regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity via neuronal histamine in the hypothalamus.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	12	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   OREXIN A AND OREXIN B are hypothalamic neuropeptides that are derived from a 130-amino-acid precursor, prepro-orexin and are potent agonists at both the orexin-1 (OX1) and orexin-2 (OX2) receptors.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Orexin neurons are located in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), from which they innervate almost all regions of the brain except the cerebellum (1, 2).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Especially dense projections are observed in specific regions of the thalamus, limbic system, and aminergic nuclei, such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), serotonergic raphe nucleus, and histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) (3, 4).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Concomitantly, the presence of orexin receptors has been identified in these nuclei, namely OX1R in the LC and OX2R in the TMN (5).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Hypothalamic histamine neurons, with cell bodies in the TMN, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological functions, such as feeding behavior, drinking behavior, and thermoregulation, as well as the autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine systems (6).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The orexin-histamine signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle, although its involvement in other hypothalamic functions remains unclear (7).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	18	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a major role in energy expenditure and thermogenesis via the function of uncoupling protein 1.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The regulation of energy expenditure in BAT is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system and higher brain structures.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Discrete hypothalamic nuclei and various orexigenic or anorexigenic neuropeptides regulate BAT metabolism by affecting efferent sympathetic nerve activity (8, 9, 10, 11).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Hypothalamic neuronal histamine, an anorexigenic substance, increases BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Orexins affect energy balance and thermoregulation.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Orexin A has been shown to induce hypothermia and food intake, and both orexins increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (13, 14, 15, 16).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Therefore, it is highly probable that orexins regulate BAT energy expenditure and thermogenesis by influencing sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We thus hypothesized that hypothalamic neuronal histamine may mediate orexin signals to the sympathetic nerves that innervate BAT, because the close relationship between these two systems has been recognized both anatomically and functionally (17, 18).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This study therefore examined the effects of central administration of orexins on electrophysiological sympathetic nerve activity in BAT and modulation of these responses by neuronal histamine.

0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Depletion of neuronal histamine by pretreatment with FMH attenuated the sympathetic nerve responses induced by orexin B but not those induced by orexin A, indicating that the action of orexin B is mediated by neuronal histamine.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Thus, it is likely that the dual effects of orexin on BAT sympathetic nerve may depend on differences in peptide subtype and/or its target neuronal substance.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	115	 We present here a discussion of how orexin differentiates its actions on sympathetic nerves, as well as the effects on neuronal histamine.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	116	The actions of orexins are mediated via two G protein-coupled receptors, OX1R and OX2R (1, 2).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The receptor binding affinity of orexin A is 10 to 100 times greater than orexin B for OX1R, whereas both orexins are equipotent for OX2R (2, 23, 24, 25).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Distinct expression patterns of the two receptor subtypes have been identified throughout the brain (5).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Considering the i3vt infusion site used in this study, the target site for the binding of orexin to receptors may be either the hypothalamus or the brain stem.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	120	 From this standpoint, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the A5 cell group, and the LC, all of which express high levels of OX1R mRNA, may be candidates as targets of orexin A, because these nuclei have been identified as central origins of efferent pathways to the BAT and to each other (26).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	121	On the other hand, high-density expression of OX2R has been observed in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), the LHA, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the ventral premammillary nucleus, and the TMN, and moderate expression levels have been found in the medial preoptic area and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (5).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The PVN and medial preoptic area were identified as major hypothalamic origins of efferent pathways to BAT in a neuroanatomical study (26).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In fact, chemical stimulation of these nuclei increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	124	 From the ARC, the LHA (especially orexin neurons themselves), and the PVN, direct neuronal projections to the intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord, a location of sympathetic preganglionic neurons, have been identified (27, 28).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Among these nuclei, cumulative evidence indicates the importance of the LHA and the ARC in orexin-A-OX2R signaling to suppress BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated an excitatory effect of orexin A on LHA neuronal activity and an inhibitory influence of this area on BAT sympathetic nerve activity (8), indicating that the LHA is a target site of orexin A for regulation of the sympathetic innervation of BAT.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	127	In contrast to the suppressive effects of orexin A, central administration of orexin B in the present study increased BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In addition, this orexin B-induced response was attenuated by histamine depletion caused by pretreatment with FMH.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	129	 As described above, the presence of orexin neurons, as well as the orexin receptor OXR2, has been identified in the TMN, a site of origin for histamine neurons (29).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It has been demonstrated that neuronal histamine mediates orexin signaling in the regulation of the sleep-wakefulness cycle (30).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Finally, central administration of histamine has been shown to increase BAT sympathetic nerve activity (12).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Taken together, the evidence suggests that it is highly probable that orexin B regulates BAT sympathetic nerve activity in an excitatory manner through OX2R in the TMN.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Our unpublished observation demonstrated that FMH treatment, but not neuropeptide Y antagonist, influenced orexin B-induced feeding and/or sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The results suggested that neuronal histamine, but not neuropeptide Y, might be closely involved in the orexin B-induced feeding behavior and sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Further study is necessary to clarify the details of this mechanism.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	136	Considering both the present and previous studies, the results suggest that OXR in hypothalamus or the brain stem may mediate the orexin-induced effect on BAT sympathetic nerve activity.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In addition, modulation of OXR in the outside of the hypothalamus, such as cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and the cisterna magna, is also possible.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Previous studies demonstrated that orexin could have direct effects at the level of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons (31).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Beyond BAT sympathetic nerve activity, further studies that examine the sympathetic nerve activity of renal and lumber nerves may be merited.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	140	Functional studies have recently demonstrated that central administration of orexin A or orexin B induces hypothermia or hyperthermia, respectively (14, 15).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	141	 These results are consistent with the present study, because the time course of BAT thermogenesis, as assessed by local BAT temperature, was similar to that observed for BAT sympathetic nerve activity (32).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	142	 On the other hand, previous studies demonstrated an orexin A-induced hyperthermic response in unanesthetized animals (33, 34).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It is well known that arousal state and muscle movement affect body temperature; in the unanesthetized condition, administration of orexin A induced an increase in arousal level and consequent arbitrary movements, both of which may elevate body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	144	 There was the possibility that anesthesia might modulate BAT sympathetic nerve activity and thermogenesis because anesthesia is a factor, but not the sole mechanism, regulating arousal state and body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Because the present study was limited to the acute phase of orexins  effects in anesthetized rats, it is possible that differences in the state of arousal may determine the effect of orexins on body temperature.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In addition, the timing of infusion might influence the orexin-induced sympathetic nerve activity because the effects of orexins are clearly dependent on the sleep-wake cycle (30).
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	147	In summary, we demonstrated that central administration of orexins induces dual effects on BAT sympathetic nerve activity: inhibition by orexin A and stimulation by orexin B.
0.22697699.15746258.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Hypothalamic neuronal histamine is involved in the latter response of BAT sympathetic nerve activity.

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Together, these data suggest that Y4 receptor modulation of LH release is likely to be indirect through orexin cell bodies and that orexin modulates GnRH neurons directly via OX-R1.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	15	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   THE NEUROPEPTIDES OREXIN A and orexin B, also known as hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2, have recently been characterized (1, 2) and implicated in the regulation of arousal states, energy metabolism, and neuroendocrine reproductive function (for reviews see Refs.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The peptides are derived from a common precursor, and their expression has been identified in neuronal cell bodies of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although orexin-expressing cell bodies are restricted to this area, they send widespread projections throughout the brain and spinal cord.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Orexin actions are mediated via G protein-coupled receptors of two different subtypes (OX-R1 and OX-R2).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	19	 OX-R2 is a nonselective receptor that binds both orexin A and B, and OX-R1 is highly selective for orexin-A (2).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Complementary to the widespread projections of orexin fibers (6), OX-R1 and OX-R2 mRNA and protein have been found widely expressed in the brain (7, 8, 9, 10).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recent physiological and neuroanatomical studies suggest that orexin A may play an important role in control of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For example, it has been shown that central administration of orexin A stimulates LH secretion (11).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, similar to other orexigenic peptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin has been shown to have bimodal effects on LH secretion, with orexin stimulating LH secretion in steroid-primed ovariectomized rats but inhibiting LH secretion in the absence of ovarian steroids (11, 12).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It has also been demonstrated that immunoneutralization of orexin A in the brain completely abolishes both LH and PRL surges, but icv administration of orexin leads to a dose-dependent recovery of fasting-suppressed LH surges (13).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition, tissue explant studies have shown that orexin A stimulates GnRH release from the hypothalamus of both intact male rats and female rats at proestrus (14).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently a study employing low-dose estrogen replacement in ovariectomized rats, resulting in serum levels similar to those observed in diestrus, demonstrated that low-dose estrogen potentiates the suppressive effects of centrally administered orexin A on LH secretion (15), suggesting that orexin A is inhibitory during diestrus, or low estrogen states, and excitatory during surge conditions.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although orexin is clearly implicated in the regulation of GnRH/LH secretion, the neuroanatomical pathway by which orexin may be mediating its effects in the rat remains to be determined.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether orexin fibers project to and come in close contact with GnRH neurons and whether GnRH neurons express OX-R1 in the rat.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	29	Similar to orexin, NPY has been found to elicit bimodal effects on LH release, most likely acting through the Y1 (16, 17, 18), Y4 (17, 19, 20, 21), or Y5 (22, 23) receptor subtypes.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recently our laboratory reported that the majority of orexin cell bodies in the LHA expressed Y4-like immunoreactivity (Y4-ir), and some orexin fibers also were positive for Y4-ir (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Others have shown that activation of Y4 receptors with a Y4 agonist, 1229U91, or a high-affinity ligand for the Y4 receptor, rat pancreatic polypeptide (rPP), stimulates GnRH neurons and in turn LH release in intact male rats (20) and is important in the basal release of LH in the female rat (17).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Conversely, when the infertile, leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse is crossed with the Y4 knockout mouse, fertility is partially restored, suggesting the Y4 receptor is involved in suppressing reproductive function (21).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Taken together, these data suggest that some of the effects of Y4 activation on LH release may be mediated via orexin.

0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	171	 As previously suggested by similar findings in the ovine hypothalamus (25), direct projections by Ob-Rb-expressing orexin neurons to GnRH neurons may provide one potential neuroanatomical circuit by which leptin regulates GnRH activity.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	172	NPY is another neuropeptide system that may be an important integrating signal for both energy balance/food intake and reproductive function (34).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Similar to the effects of orexin, NPY also elicits steroid-dependent effects on LH secretion (35).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Orexin neurons in the LHA receive direct synaptic contacts by NPY neurons projecting from the arcuate nucleus and in turn send reciprocal projections to arcuate nucleus NPY neurons (36).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Currently, there is evidence implicating the Y1 (16, 17, 18), Y4 (17, 19, 20, 21), and Y5 (22, 23) receptor subtypes in NPY s modulation of neuroendocrine reproductive function.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Of direct relevance, Y4-ir and mRNA are colocalized with orexin neurons in the LHA (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These data, coupled with the present findings that GnRH neurons express the OX-R1 and are contacted by orexin fibers, demonstrate a unique potential neuronal circuit whereby NPY, acting through the Y4 receptor, can exert its effects on LH release via the modulation of orexin.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Because the present study also showed that Y4-positive orexin fibers were never observed in close contact with GnRH neurons, the major actions of the Y4 receptor appear to be through postsynaptic effects on orexin cell bodies within the LHA.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Taken together, these data suggest that orexin neurons, by receiving critical input via Y4 and leptin receptors, may provide an important link between the regulation of energy balance and reproductive function.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	180	A number of questions remain concerning the modulatory effects of the Y4-orexin system on GnRH neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	181	 First, the endogenous ligand for the brain Y4 receptor is not clear.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Is it NPY, which has a much lower affinity for the Y4 receptor (37), or other pancreatic polypeptide family ligands? Our recent study characterizing the expression of Y4-ir on orexin neurons also found that administration of rPP, an endogenous ligand of the Y4 receptor, induced robust cFos activation in orexin neurons (19).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Furthermore, rPP stimulated a modest increase in food intake and a robust drinking response (19), which is similar to responses by orexin.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	184	 These data suggest that stimulation of the Y4 receptor by rPP is excitatory to orexin neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	185	 However, the effects of Y4 on reproductive function have been shown to be both stimulatory (17, 20) and inhibitory (21).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Similarly, the effects of orexin have been reported to be both stimulatory and inhibitory to reproductive function (11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, it is possible the actions of the Y4 receptor on the GnRH/LH axis are mediated via the orexin system.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	188	In summary, these data provide neuroanatomical evidence for a direct link between the orexin system and GnRH neurons.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	189	 These findings suggest that orexin plays a direct role in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction and may also be uniquely positioned to integrate signals associated with energy balance regulation.
0.099135764.12639939.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Additional studies will be necessary to establish the relative importance of this novel neuronal circuitry in the regulation of reproductive function during normal cyclicity as well as during metabolic changes.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Our data reveal a specific effect of the drug upon an area of the frontal lobe called the anterior cingulate cortex.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Anterior cingulate cortex is involved in a wide range of executive functions (Bush et al, 2000) and has been activated during working memory protocols in previous studies (Callicott et al, 2000, 2003; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 2001).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Its activation in people with chronic schizophrenia appears to be enhanced by modafinil (Fig.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Therefore it might be posited that increased anterior cingulate cortex activation is either unrelated to cognition or indicative of reduced efficiency of cognitive processing (Callicott et al, 2000; Manoach, 2003).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	150	 If greater anterior cingulate cortex activation occurs without an increase in cognitive performance then brain function might be said to be less efficient in the presence of modafinil.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, it is important to note that cognitive function did improve in a minority of patients, and that although it might be posited that this is to be expected statistically (as merely a manifestation of variation around the mean), there is a feature of the data that runs counter to this interpretation.

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The positive correlation implies that the magnitude of anterior cingulate cortex activation and cognitive performance are indeed related in the context of modafinil exposure; those exhibiting the greater anterior cingulate cortex response also exhibit the greater cognitive enhancement (of working memory).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	155	Accounting for `responders' It is of interest that those exhibiting greater physiological and cognitive response to modafinil tended to be those who were receiving `typical' neuroleptic medications (depots and sulpiride).

0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The neurotransmitter systems implicated in the promotion of wakefulness by modafinil include the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Although antipsychotics share antagonism of the dopaminergic system (especially at the D2 receptor), the typicals and atypicals differ in their affinities for other receptors, particularly 5HT2A (Keefe et al, 1999).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In animal models modafinil's effect of increasing alertness is attenuated by 5HT2A antagonism (Shelton et al, 1995), hence, it is possible that atypical antipsychotic treatment (if antagonising 5HT2A) might constrain the cognotropic effects of modafinil (a hypothesis deserving further study).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Alternatively, the ability of atypicals themselves to enhance cognition (albeit to a limited extent; Keefe et al, 1999) might curtail further improvement (on modafinil).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	161	Safety There are a number of caveats to our study and its findings.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	162	 First, for the reasons described, we deliberately utilised a relatively low dose of modafinil.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This may have been sub-optimal.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Nevertheless, one of our participants underwent psychotic relapse 4 days post-drug.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	165	 We cannot determine whether modafinil was responsible.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Although covert non-adherence to concurrent medication cannot be excluded (he was receiving an oral antipsychotic), we must be wary of seeking to exculpate the test medication.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, a psychotic reaction to a single dose of modafinil is unprecedented (to our knowledge), although there are cases of psychosis emerging de novo in those receiving multiple doses.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The manufacturer's prescribing information reports that: `one healthy male volunteer developed ideas of reference, paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations in association with multiple daily 600 mg doses of [modafinil] and sleep deprivation.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	169	 There was no evidence of psychosis 36 hours after drug discontinuation.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The British National Formulary does not mention psychosis as either a contraindication to or a consequence of modafinil exposure.
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	171	In a recent study of 20 patients with schizophrenia exposed to a single dose of 200 mg of modafinil, the drug elicited no exacerbation of psychosis (Turner et al, 2004).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, there are anecdotal accounts of schizophrenic relapse following repeated dosing (Narendran et al, 2002; Rosenthal  and  Bryant, 2003).
0.09719374.15994572.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Further multi-dosing studies in other centres may help to clarify the magnitude of such a putative risk.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	7	Orexin A and orexin B are hypothalamic peptides that act on their targets via two G protein-coupled receptors (OX1 and OX2 receptors).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In the central nervous system, the cell bodies producing orexins are localized in a narrow region within the lateral hypothalamus and project mainly to regions involved in feeding, sleep, and autonomic functions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Via putative pre- and postsynaptic effects, orexins increase synaptic activity in these regions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In isolated neurons and cells expressing recombinant receptors orexins cause Ca2+ elevation, which is mainly dependent on influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The activity of orexinergic cells appears to be controlled by feeding- and sleep-related signals via a variety of neurotransmitters/hormones from the brain and other tissues.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Orexins and orexin receptors are also found outside the central nervous system, particularly in organs involved in feeding and energy metabolism, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	13	, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adrenal gland.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In the present review we focus on the physiological properties of the cells that secrete or respond to orexins.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	19	OUR KNOWLEDGE of the orexinergic system was initiated in 1998 by two independent groups and approaches (reviewed in Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In January 1998, the group of Sutcliffe published a study (37) in which they predicted that a particular rat hypothalamic mRNA species ("clone 35"; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	21	 50) would code for a precursor peptide 130 amino acids (aa) in length, each molecule of which would generate two separate peptides of 39- and 29-aa lengths.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The peptides were named hypocretins, on the basis of their hypothalamic localization and their proposed sequence similarity to the secretin family of peptides; however, only orexin B bears any significant resemblance to secretin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The precursor peptide would thus be preprohypocretin and the two final peptides hypocretin (hcrt)-1 and hcrt-2.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Simultaneously with the work of the group of Sutcliffe, the group of Yanagisawa (154) isolated a hypothalamic 33-aa peptide that activated the orphan receptor HFGAN72.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This receptor was found also to respond to another peptide, 28 aa in length.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A second receptor was cloned on the basis of its sequence similarity to HFGAN72, and this receptor also responded to both isolated peptides with Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	27	 On the basis of the peptide sequences, Sakurai and coworkers (154) cloned the cDNA for the precursor peptide (130 aa in the rat).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The peptides were named orexins, because they increased food intake in nonfasted rats when injected into the lateral ventricle.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The precursor peptide thus became preproorexin, the 33- and 28-aa final peptides orexin A and orexin B, respectively, and the receptors OX1 and OX2 receptors.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Both preprohypocretin and preproorexin were found preferentially in the rat brain and more specifically in the hypothalamus (37, 154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Cellular and systemic responses to the peptides were observed in the rat.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Application of hcrt-2 increased postsynaptic current frequency in rat hypothalamic neurons in culture (37), and orexin A and -B increased food intake in nonfasted rats (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	33	It soon became clear that the peptides isolated by the two groups were, in principle, identical.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, there was an error in the peptide sequences deduced by de Lecea and coworkers (37), so that most authors refer to the accepted sequences by Sakurai et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	35	 (154) and not to de Lecea et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	36	 (37) even when they are using the hypocretin nomenclature.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Therefore, the current praxis makes preproorexin = preprohypocretin, orexin A = hcrt-1, orexin B = hcrt-2, OX1 receptor = hcrtr-1, and OX2 receptor = hcrtr-2.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	38	 There is an ongoing argument concerning which nomenclature should be used.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To avoid confusion with the sequences we use the orexin nomenclature throughout this review.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	40	Today there is a wealth of information concerning the anatomic architecture of the orexinergic system as well as the systemic effects of orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The most prominent and well-demonstrated effect of orexins is undoubtedly regulation of sleep/wakefulness (reviewed in Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Although many other responses have been shown, their physiological significance is less clear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Effects on feeding behavior have been demonstrated in a multitude of studies, but the results are somewhat contradictory.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The current view is that orexins may rather regulate short-term appetite, energy metabolism, and feeding-associated processes (e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	45	, gastrointestinal functions, mastication).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Orexins also affect hormonal secretion, the most well-demonstrated effects being those on the hormones involved in the stress response and energy metabolism such as glucocorticoids and norepinephrine.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	47	 At the same time, information concerning the regulatory mechanisms of orexinergic systems and their targets on a cellular level is lagging behind.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The human preproorexin gene (chromosome 17) has been thoroughly characterized (155).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It is composed of two exons, the latter of which includes the whole of the coding region of the final peptides.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This has been utilized to cause selective depletion of orexinergic neurons in transgenic mice expressing preproorexin-ataxin-3 fusion protein (60).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In these mice, orexinergic neurons are progressively lost postnatally.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For transcription, the most essential part has been suggested to be the 450 bp most proximal to the gene (185).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	61	Cleavage of one molecule of preproorexin and further modification leads to production of one molecule each of orexin A and orexin B; however, HPLC detection of orexins in the human brain suggests two- to fivefold higher levels of orexin B than orexin A in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS) (34, 35, 125, 126).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Mammalian orexin A in rat is a 33-aa peptide with two intrachain disulfide bridges, and orexin B is a 28-aa linear peptide (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In addition, orexin B and secretin contain an identical stretch of seven amino acids.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Orexin A and -B are likely to be COOH-terminally amidated, and the NH2-terminal glutamine residue of orexin A may be modified to a pyroglutamoyl residue (154); however, the posttranslational modifications have been experimentally verified only in the rat.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	74	Orexin A seems to have much higher stability than orexin B in the physiological milieu (89), which may explain why orexin A is more readily detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than orexin B (148).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Orexin A also displays much higher lipid solubility than orexin B, probably making orexin Ain contrast to orexin Bblood-brain barrier permeant (89).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Orexin immunoreactivity has been found in putative endocrine release sites of hypothalamus, neurohypophysis, and pancreas (see below) offering the interesting possibility that orexins could also act as hormones between the CNS and the periphery.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Yet indirect evidence suggests that orexin A in plasma originates from peripheral sources (32), and no brain penetration of intravenous orexin A has been seen in the rat (11).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	78	Orexins from Xenopus laevis have also been described (163).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In this species, preproorexin is rather similar to that in humans (overall identity = 56%).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Xenopus orexin A is 31 aa long, lacking two NH2-terminal amino acids seen in human orexin A, and it contains 6 aa substitutions compared with human orexin A (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Both Xenopus orexins are supposed to be posttranslationally modified in the same way as the rat orexins (disulfide bridges and COOH-terminal amidation) except that Xenopus orexin A does not contain the NH2-terminal pyroglutamoyl residue.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	83	Orexin A and preproorexin mRNA concentrations show circadian variation in rats in a 12:12-h light-dark cycle (47, 176, 196).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Preproorexin mRNA and orexin A concentration in the hypothalamus reach a maximum around the light onset or somewhat later and a minimum at the light offset or somewhat later.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Measurements of orexin A in the pons and in the intracisternal space also show diurnal variation, but the time points are shifted compared with the hypothalamus (47, 176).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (126) did not find any circadian variation in hypothalamic orexin A or -B concentration; the time points (5 h after dark and 5 h after light onset) may have been unfortunately chosen (in the light of results in Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	87	 There appear to be bilateral connections between suprachiasmatic nucleus and orexinergic neurons in the rat posterior hypothalamus (1, 36, 64, 121, 125), which may indicate reciprocal regulation of the circadian rhythms.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	88	Two receptors responding to orexin stimulation have been cloned.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	89	 These receptors, called OX1 and OX2 receptors, form a subclass of their own under the class A G protein-coupled receptors (class A  peptide receptor  orexin and neuropeptide FF receptors  orexin receptors).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Both receptors are rather "average" G protein-coupled receptors with modestly long NH2 and COOH termini and neither very long nor short i3 loops (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	91	 OX1 receptor (chromosome 1) is 425 aa long and OX2 receptor (chromosome 6) 444 aa long in humans, and there is an overall 64% sequence identity between them.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In each gene, the identity of one amino acid is disputed based on a Entrez search (covering a variety of databases such as SwissProt) and a variety of published references: in OX1 receptor, aa 280 in the i3 loop is either Gly or Ala, and in OX2 receptor, aa 308 in the sixth transmembrane segment is either Val or Ile.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Amino acids subject to these polymorphisms/mutations are also marked in Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The gene transcript for each receptor is composed of a 5'-untranslated region, seven separate exons, each of which codes a part of the final protein, and six introns.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	96	 High sequence identity [91-98%; comparison made with Blast (http://www.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	97	gov/BLAST)] is seen between the cloned mammalian species (human, pig, dog, rat, mouse) variants.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Two neuropeptide FF receptors (14, 28) are most closely related to the orexin receptors, but the gross sequence identity is very low (31-35% for the human receptors), no longer stretches of high identity can be found, and identity of a nearly similar degree can be observed between neuropeptide FF receptor and, for instance, some neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Furthermore, orexin receptors are 28-31% identical to many other peptide receptors including NPY Y2, thyrotropin (TSH)-releasing hormone (TRH), and NK2 tachykinin receptors.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Therefore, grouping of orexin and neuropeptide FF receptors in the same family is questionable.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	113	In the original studies on orexin receptors two cellular responses were identified: recombinantly expressed orexin receptor strongly elevated Ca2+ in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (154), whereas in the hypothalamic neurons increased action potential frequency was observed (37).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Many systemic responses were described thereafter but the molecular mechanisms of these have not in most cases been investigated in detail.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	115	Both OX1 and OX2 receptors elevate Ca2+ when recombinantly expressed in CHO cells (67, 107, 138, 154, 168).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Because orexin receptors caused Ca2+ elevations of high magnitude in this cell line devoid of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, they were thought to couple to the phospholipase C-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-Ca2+ release cascade via the Gq family of G proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The orexins were subsequently shown to elevate intracellular Ca2+ in neuronal cell cultures from hypothalamus and cortex (183, 184).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The Ca2+ elevations in neurons were found to be independent of intracellular release and to require extracellular Ca2+ (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The requirement for extracellular Ca2+ is not a typical property of a Gq-mediated response, which consists of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores followed by a "capacitative" Ca2+ entry to refill the stores.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The observed Ca2+ elevation in neurons was blocked by a bisindoylmaleimide protein kinase C inhibitor.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	121	 It was therefore suggested, that orexin receptors would activate protein kinase C, which would phosphorylate and thereby activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Similar findings were described by Uramura et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	123	 (181) in isolated rat ventral tegmental neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Orexin A was determined to elevate intracellular Ca2+ via activation of nitrendipine- and -conotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The response was also sensitive to calphostin C (inhibitor of protein kinase C) and D609 (inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C), which suggested the following activation sequence: orexin receptor  phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C  protein kinase C  N-/L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels  influx of Ca2+.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Ca2+ elevation has also been measured in cultured rat embryonic spinal cord neurons, although the source of Ca2+ has not been investigated (182).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Indirect evidence in rat locus ceruleus and tuberomamillary nucleus also suggests activation of Ca2+ influx (44, 70).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	132	 As shown, the response to hypocretin 2 was completely blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	136	What then is the general role of Ca2+ influx in orexin receptor-mediated cellular responses? In neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx has been observed by fura 2 measurements (181, 182-184) and is also suggested by electrophysiological measurements (44, 70).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Because orexins may depolarize neurons via block of K+ channels (see Depolarizing actions), some Ca2+ influx may even result from an indirect activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The situation may be more complex at other sites as discussed below.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	139	 (107) discovered that removal of extracellular Ca2+ caused a significant (8- to 100-fold) drop in the potency of orexin A for the OX1 receptor (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In other respects, the results of Smart et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	141	 (168) suggest qualities expected from Gq-dependent signaling, that is, sensitivity to the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122, rapid and transient spike, and extracellular Ca2+-dependent secondary phase (capacitative Ca2+ entry).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In contrast, a more detailed analysis of Ca2+ signaling in CHO cells indicated that the dependence of the Ca2+ response on extracellular Ca2+ is due to the activation of a Ca2+ influx pathway (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The Ca2+ response was abolished when the membrane potential was held close to the reversal potential of Ca2+ (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	144	 4B), and a Ca2+ elevation could be observed by returning to a negative holding potential (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In addition, orexin A activated an influx of Mn2+ ions in conditions where no intracellular release occurred.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The primary response to OX1 receptor stimulation in CHO cells is thus receptor-operated Ca2+ influx (107).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This Ca2+ influx amplifies phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, so that in the absence of Ca2+ influx, IP3 production and Ca2+ release occur with a potency 100 times lower than in the presence of Ca2+ influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Ca2+ elevation alone is not sufficient to activate phospholipase C in these cells, suggesting that Ca2+ influx acts in concert with a G protein-mediated mechanism.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The identity of this Ca2+ influx pathway and its activation mechanism by the orexin receptors remains unresolved; however, the potency of pharmacological blockers suggests that it is a different molecular entity than the store-operated Ca2+ channel in CHO cells (96).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	150	 It thus seems that both in neuronal and nonneuronal cells orexin receptors activate both Ca2+ influx and the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C pathway, a view that is supported by a study in which orexin receptors are heterologously expressed in a variety of different cell types (Holmqvist, Akerman, and Kukkonen, unpublished observation).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In a recent study, orexin A and -B equipotently increased norepinephrine release from rat cerebrocortical slices.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	152	 When extracellular Ca2+ was removed, the maximum responses to both peptides were lowered by 50% and the EC50 values shifted to  > 10-fold higher concentrations (66).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Although the response mechanisms have not been clarified with direct Ca2+ measurements, the overall pattern is very similar to what is seen with recombinant CHO cells (107).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Ca2+ response to orexin A is only seen at the negative holding potential, which indicates that Ca2+ influx is required for the response.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	163	Functional experiments indicate that in addition to Ca2+ release and activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels, there are several types of Ca2+ influx pathways activated by G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Although in most cases the mechanisms have not been clarified, these pathways may be activated directly by G protein subunits or second messengers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These pathways may be identical or related to the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family (reviewed in Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The TRP genes encode a family of over 20 proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Many of the TRP gene products form Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels, and some members of the TRP (super)family even have inherent protein kinase or ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase domains.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	168	 TRP channels are widely expressed in mammalian cells, and they are activated after Gq-coupled receptor stimulation but the activation mechanisms are in many cases unknown.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	169	 It will be interesting to see whether any of the TRP channels can be held responsible for the orexin receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Characterization of receptor-mediated electrical responses in neuronal preparations is performed with some common electrophysiological techniques.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In many situations in which intracellular recordings are difficult, extracellular electrodes can be more practical to use and they are likely to induce much less cellular damage.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	172	 On the other hand, these response measurements are usually limited to the registration of action potential frequency.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Measurements with intracellular electrodes (normal or microelectrodes) can be performed with feedback amplification allowing voltage or current clamp or in a "free-running" mode, in which case voltage changes are monitored.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These latter methods, most importantly, offer better possibilities for investigation of the mechanisms underlying the electrical activity than the extracellular electrodes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	175	Recordings from neurons are usually performed in slices or similar preparations, in which cells are synaptically coupled.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The cell measured can thus be the target for upstream signals rather than responding directly to orexins themselves.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The usual way of eliminating the secondary effects far upstream of the measured cell is to use tetrodotoxin (TTX).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	178	 By blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels this hinders action potential propagation in most neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, TTX will not, for instance, block direct effects of orexins on the presynaptic terminal most immediately upstream of the cell investigated.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Therefore, TTX does not exclusively separate pre- and postsynaptic effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channelsand therefore transmitter releasecan be blocked with, for example, Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and more specific drugs or toxins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, orexin receptors may activate Ca2+ channels not sensitive to these inhibitors (see Ca2+ Elevation).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	183	 On the other hand, these blockers may also affect, for instance, orexin-activated Ca2+ channels other than the voltage-gated channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This may lead to a block of both pre- and postsynaptic responses to orexin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	185	 As an example of this, Ni2+ blocks voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, some orexin-activated non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (96), and even the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (91).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	186	 "Synaptic isolation" is performed by using medium with low extracellular Ca2+ ( > 0.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	187	3 mM) and high extracellular Mg2+ ( < 4 mM).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This widely used method appears to block electrically evoked synaptic transmission, but the mechanistic basis for it is unclear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Similarly as above, it is unknown whether this method would affect orexin-mediated presynaptic responses if these were mediated by other than voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or by Ca2+ release.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	190	 It is also difficult to preclude possible postsynaptic effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	191	Some methods give a clearer separation of pre- and postsynaptic responses.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Dissociation of the cells removes presynaptic contacts.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, even in this case it is possible, although unlikely, that responses are mediated by some indirect messengers released from neighboring cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Measurement of synaptic activity is a method often used for studies of receptor-coupled mechanisms.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Increased/decreased frequency of excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSC, respectively) by orexins suggests a stimulatory effect on transmitter release, i.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	196	 When the amplitude of a synaptic current is increased, it is difficult to conclude whether the response is pre- or postsynaptic.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The most common electrophysiological response to orexins appears to be increase in spontaneous or evoked action potential frequency, as observed with extracellular or intracellular electrodes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Increased action potential frequency has been measured in the hypothalamus [rat tuberomamillary nucleus, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive, -responsive, and -indifferent neurons (for definition, see Responses of orexinergic cells to feeding stimuli), arcuate nucleus, and paraventricular nucleus; Refs.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In contrast, orexin A suppresses the firing rate of glucose-responsive neurons in rat ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, antagonizing the effect of glucose (164).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Action potentials and their enhancement with orexins are blocked by TTX (3, 44, 54, 70, 75, 165, 170, 195) but usually not by synaptic isolation with low Ca2+-high Mg2+ (8, 42, 93, 147) or voltage-gated Ca2+ channel block with Cd2+ (170).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The latter data therefore suggest that orexins would directly affect the postsynaptic neurons at some sites, with reservations for the methodological shortcomings (see above).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	205	 It should also be noted that the putative presynaptic block has only been applied in a minority of studies.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Interestingly, a TTX-insensitive response is observed in rat locus ceruleus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Hypocretin 2 (orexin B) depolarizes and increases spontaneous firing frequency in locus ceruleus slices (70).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In the presence of TTX these spontaneous spikes vanish, but orexin B still causes a small depolarization (3.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	209	4 mV) and electrical discharges, although these spikes are slower than the spontaneous spikes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These spikes may be caused by Ca2+ channels or TTX-insensitive Na+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	211	More detailed analysis of individual synaptic currents shows enhancement of synaptic activity by orexins as an increase in spontaneous or evoked EPSC (rat hypothalamus, rat superficial dorsal horn, and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus; Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	212	 19, 37, 49, 54, 183, 184) and IPSC (rat hypothalamic and superficial dorsal horn neurons; Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	213	 EPSCs and IPSCs are blocked by TTX in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19, 54) but not in rat hypothalamus (49, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Therefore, the orexin receptor mediating these putative presynaptic responses may lie farther upstream in rat superficial dorsal horn and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In both of these sites, depolarization mediated by orexins persists in the presence of TTX, suggesting that orexin receptors are expressed both on the cell investigated and on some upstream neuron.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In some cases, the released transmitters causing the postsynaptic currents have been investigated with receptor blockers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In mouse laterodorsal tegmental neurons, the orexin-mediated elevation in the EPSC frequency is attenuated by ionotropic glutamate receptor block, whereas the (postsynaptic) depolarization response is not affected (19).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In rat embryonic hypothalamic neurons in culture, hypocretin 2 (orexin B) increases IPSC and EPSC frequency in a TTX-insensitive manner (49, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The former is blocked by GABAA receptor block and the latter by ionotropic glutamate receptor block.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In rat superficial dorsal horn neurons, orexin B-mediated increase in IPSC frequency is inhibited by glycine receptor block (54).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Amplitudes of the postsynaptic currents or potentials are also sometimes affected, as reported for guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia [reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitude; Ref.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Increased amplitude of postsynaptic potentials or currents does not specify a pre- or postsynaptic mechanism in these cases.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Depolarization or inward current has often been measured in response to orexin application.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This depolarization also results, when investigated, without exception in increased action potential frequency, and often the depolarization has been studied in the presence of TTX to block this "disturbance" (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Depolarizations of a maximum magnitude of 3-10 mV have been observedmainly with free-running electrodesin the hypothalamus (rat tuberomamillary nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive neurons; Refs.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	241	The orexin-stimulated increases in current most probably reflect direct effects of orexin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Evidence for this includes the stable currents and lack of effect of TTX, "synaptic block," or other kinds of elimination of EPSCs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	243	 What then is the mechanism of this depolarization? In rat lateral hypothalamic glucose-sensitive neurons, locus ceruleus, autonomic preganglionic neurons of intermediolateral cell column, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and in guinea pig ileal S-type submucosal neurons, increased input resistance (by 2-85%) has been measured to co-occur with the depolarization (3, 75, 80, 92, 103).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This suggests that orexins may inhibit K+ channels, which is also suggested by the reduced afterhyperpolarization amplitude observed in rat locus ceruleus and in guinea pig ileal submucosal ganglia (70, 92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Also, the current-voltage relationship, when measured, suggests K+ channel inhibition (rat locus ceruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus; Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	246	 On the other hand, orexins may activate Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, as suggested in mouse peritoneal macrophages (76).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It is interesting that orexins instead inhibit the slow afterhyperpolarization in locus ceruleus, which is thought to depend on Ca2+-activated K+ channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	248	 It is possible that orexins do not elevate Ca2+ at all sites or that other signals generated by the receptor activation counteract the effect of Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	249	In other cases, reduced input resistance or noise is associated with the orexin-induced depolarization.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This has been seen in rat tuberomamillary nucleus (44), rat lumbar spinal cord (54), and mouse laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (19).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In hypothalamic histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B both depolarize and increase the firing rate (8, 44, 195) (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This depolarization is abolished by removal of extracellular Na+ and virtually unaffected by an increase in extracellular K+ (44).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Pharmacological block of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger reduces the depolarization, suggesting that it may be mediated by Ca2+ elevation-induced activation of electrogenic Na+/Ca2+ exchange.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The residual depolarization is blocked by Ni2+, which may suggest that the putatively underlying Ca2+ current can also slightly depolarize the cells itself.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Even in rat dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, a part of the current appears to depend on Na+ and the remaining part may be caused by K+ channel block (75).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	256	Finally, no clear change in the input resistance may be seen [rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (165), locus ceruleus (56, 170), and intermediolateral cell column (3)].
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This could occur if the increased conductance caused by opening of some ion channels (Na+, Ca2+?) was compensated by the closure of other channels (K+) or if orexins rather affected transporters.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Even in a single cell, orexins may utilize several mechanisms for depolarization (44, 75).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	259	Summary of orexin effects on electrical activity of neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Thus orexins most often increase neuronal activity via presynaptic effects (increased transmitter release via unknown mechanisms) and via postsynaptic depolarization (block of K+ channels, activation of cation channels and electrogenic transporters?).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Some of the effects such as the putative K+ channel inhibition are typical for Gq-coupled receptors (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Other mechanisms may be secondary to the Ca2+ elevation or may depend on the activation of nonselective cation channels like the TRP channels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	263	 On particular neurons, orexins may also cause inhibition via increased inhibitory transmitter release or via decreased postsynaptic effects of excitatory transmitters.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	264	 It is unclear which direct or indirect roles Ca2+ transients play in electrical responses to orexins, and not much effort has been put into investigation of this to date.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Independent of the method of measurement of electrical activity, the effects of orexins usually have a slow onset of action (10 s-4 min) and the recovery is even slower (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	266	 3, 9, 19, 44, 54, 75, 93, 103, 159, 165, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Most studies have been performed with slices, a preparation in which perfusion of orexins in and out may be slow.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, because rather superficial neurons are patched, there is no obvious reason why the perfusate would not reach the neurons immediately.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Furthermore, similar slow onset (10- to 20-s lag, 1 min to maximum) and delayed offset ( > 2 min to complete decay after removal) are seen in dissociated neurons (195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Therefore, it is possible that orexins affect ion channels via, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	271	, phosphorylation rather than direct G protein interaction.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Some results indicate involvement of protein kinase A and -C in orexin responses (93, 181, 183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Orexin B has been reported to reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current amplitude by 19% and to enhance GABA-induced current amplitude by 48% in dissociated rat nucleus accumbens cells (113); this could also possibly be a phosphorylation-dependent event.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	274	As discussed in Increased synaptic activity, orexins may increase transmitter release as indicated by increased/decreased synaptic potential frequency.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	275	 These are the most direct indications of presynaptic effects of orexins, and in the presence of TTX, rather certainly suggest a presynaptic site for orexin effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Inhibition of K+-stimulated serotonin release by orexin A and -B from rat hypothalamic synaptosomes also directly shows a presynaptic site of action (140).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	277	 There are also indirect indications of orexin-stimulated transmitter release from in vitro slice (norepinephrine from rat cerebral cortex; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	278	 66) or in vivo microdialysis (histamine from rat anterior hypothalamus; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In these cases, it is impossible to tell whether orexins directly affect the releasing neurons or some upstream neurons; some complex mechanism is suggested by the delayed (by 6 min) response in rat cerebrocortical slices.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	280	cAMP elevation in response to orexin stimulation was reported in the rat and human adrenal cortices, putatively via OX1 receptors (110, 117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In contrast, in primary cultures of rat hypothalamic neurons, no elevation of cAMP is seen (183).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Elevation of cAMP may occur by several mechanisms depending on the isoform of adenylyl cyclase expressed.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Adenylyl cyclase isoforms are differentially activated by Ca2+, protein kinase C, and G protein -subunits (171), and the expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms may be different in the adrenal cortex and the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	284	 G proteins might also be expressed tissue-specifically, and OX1 and OX2 receptors could couple to different G proteins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	285	 OX2 receptors have been reported to couple to Gi and Gs but not Go or Gq proteins in human fetal adrenal glands (88) and to Gi, Gs, and Gq but not Go proteins in adult human adrenal glands (146), as measured with the GTP-azidoanilide labeling method.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	286	Orexin receptors may also couple to protein kinase cascades involved in cell growth, differentiation, and death.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	287	 These effects are clearly seen when orexin receptors are expressed in CHO cells (S.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	289	 One of the most immediate indications is the rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways seen on OX1 receptor stimulation (Fig.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and -2 activation was measured by blotting against the respective phosphorylated species with specific antibodies.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Both 3 and 100 nM orexin A lead to rapid (3 min) activation of mainly ERK2, a response that is more clearly decreased at the 30 min time point at the lower concentration.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	295	OX1 and OX2 receptors were already shown in the original study to have different binding affinities for orexin A and -B (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	296	 When expressed recombinantly in CHO cells, OX1 receptor has 10 times higher affinity for orexin A than for orexin B whereas OX2 receptor binds orexin A and -B with equal affinity.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The same selectivity is seen with respect to Ca2+ elevation; thus orexin A activates OX1 receptors up to 10 times more potently than orexin B (138, 154, 168).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Thus the evidence for selectivity of OX1 receptor and nonselectivity of OX2 receptor between orexin A and -B is based solely on the studies on Ca2+ elevation in recombinant CHO cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	299	 It is difficult to find exclusive expression of one subtype in any tissue, but in some cases support for this selectivity can be found: orexin A is 5.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In isolated human adrenocortical cells, where OX1 mRNA is also predominantly found, orexin A but not orexin B stimulates cortisol secretion (117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	302	 In tissues where OX2 expression dominates, such as rat tuberomamillary nucleus, orexin A and -B are essentially equipotent in stimulating the electrical activity.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Orexin A and -B are also equally potent in releasing catecholamines from human pheochromocytoma cells, which only express OX2 mRNA (116).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	304	 On the other hand, the putatively OX2-mediated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release is 10-fold less sensitive to orexin B than to orexin A (13, 158).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	305	 It is generally dangerous to rely on so-called selective agonists, because their efficacies can be very dependent on receptor and G protein expression levels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	306	 For these pharmacological reasons and because of the chemical differences between orexin A and -B (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), conclusions on receptor subtype involvement based on potency of orexin variants (42, 113, 138, 158) should probably be avoided.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Some studies report higher potency of orexin B than orexin A with respect to some responses (76, 85), which is unexplainable on the basis of recombinant pharmacology.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Even if any pharmacological selectivity with respect to the interaction of orexin A and -B with the orexin receptor subtypes was to occur in the tissues, its physiological significance would be unclear.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	309	Molecular determinants required from orexin peptides for binding to and activation of orexin receptors have been investigated in CHO cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Comparison of structures and activities of orexin A and -B suggests that the NH2-terminal amino acids are less important for receptor binding and activation than the COOH-terminal amino acids (33).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Truncation of orexin A to orexin A15-33 reduces its potency for both OX1 and OX2 receptors 20- to 60-fold (33, 138), and further truncation successively abolishes the Ca2+ response, at least for OX1 (33).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Mutation of cystine-forming cysteines to alanines in orexin A reduces the potency of the mutant peptides for both OX1 and OX2 receptors ~10-fold (138).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	313	 However, it is difficult to judge whether this effect is due to the lost disulfide bridges or the exchanged cysteines themselves.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	314	 One-by-one replacement of each amino acid in orexin-A15-33 with alanine (alanine scan) has revealed regions of particular importance for orexin A activation of the OX1 receptor, in particular leucines 19 and 20 and the most COOH-terminal aa 26-33 seem to be of great importance (33).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Change/removal of these amino acids affects both OX1 and OX2 receptors, but some interesting differences are seen in the potency of the response.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Interestingly, none of the mutated peptides without activity are antagonists.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	319	Xenopus orexin B has been proposed to have 10-fold higher affinity and potency than Xenopus orexin A for human OX2 receptor expressed in CHO cells (163).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Both Xenopus orexin A and -B were equipotent on human OX1 receptor.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Synthetic peptides (hcrt-1 and hcrt-2) based on the originally described hypocretin sequences (37) have been shown to be ~1,000-fold less potent than the corresponding orexin peptides with respect to Ca2+ elevation in recombinant CHO cells (167).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	322	In more than 50% of the studies on cellular responses, rather high concentrations ( > 100 nM) of orexins were used to evoke response.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Even the EC50 values, when determined, can be rather high [e.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	327	 To resolve the mechanical basis for this, experiments could be performed in recombinant expression systems at different expression levels with measurement of different responses.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Another reason for the high concentrations required in some tissues may be the use of orexin B at OX1 receptor or use of the hypocretins based on the original sequences, if the weak potencies reported in recombinant systems hold true in tissues (see above).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	329	At the moment, no reliable in vivo selectivity can be obtained with known orexin receptor agonists.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Recently, synthesis of an orexin receptor subtype-selective antagonist was reported (145, 169).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	331	 This antagonist, SB-334867 (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	332	 1D), displays a 100-fold higher affinity for OX1 than OX2 receptor.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This selectivity has been successfully utilized in in vivo experiments to elucidate the role of OX1 receptors in some systemic effects of orexins (see SYSTEMIC EFFECTS OF OREXINS).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Unfortunately, no antagonist able to block OX2 receptors is available.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Conclusions on the role of OX1 receptors in some physiological processes should not be based solely on SB-334867, because orexin receptor subtypes may have overlapping and interacting roles.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	336	 However, SB-334867 is a uniquely useful tool in orexin receptor investigations.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	337	 From this perspective, it is unfortunate that SB-334867 is not widely available for orexin receptor researchers.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	338	Recently, a variety of peptide transmitters, including secretin and NPY variants, were reported to inhibit orexin A binding to membrane preparations from endogenous and recombinant cells expressing OX1 receptors, even with a nanomolar affinity (87).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	339	 These results were interpreted to indicate that interaction between orexinergic and NPYergic systems (see Connections of orexinergic pathways with other feeding-regulating transmitters/hormones) could occur at the orexin receptor level.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	340	 These results on binding could not, however, be verified in functional experiments or in binding experiments with intact cells (67, 169).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Other peptides [secretin, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), NPY variants] do not display any detectable affinity or activity on OX1 or OX2 receptors (67, 169).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	342	 67, it is more likely that the other peptides affect some intracellular process, for instance G protein binding to the receptor, which is required for high-affinity agonist binding, and therefore reduce orexin binding in some particular preparations.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Therefore, secretin should not be used to define specific orexin A binding, because this can to lead to possibly erroneous conclusions (86, 188).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	352	In the rat brain, orexinergic cell bodies are found solely in the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Within the hypothalamus these cell bodies reside bilaterally symmetrically in the lateral parts, probably most abundantly in perifornical areas (17, 24, 31, 36, 37, 56, 58, 69, 70, 131).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Orexinergic cells are interspersed among melanocyte-concentrating hormone (MCH)-ergic cells (24, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	355	 However, the overlap of the areas is not complete (17) and MCHergic cells are clearly different from orexinergic cells (17, 43, 58, 143), although they otherwise share some of the properties of orexinergic cells (1, 69, 71).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Isolated orexinergic cell bodies have also been reported in median eminence, posterior, dorsal, and dorsomedial hypothalamus, and arcuate and subincertal nuclei (24, 31, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	357	Orexinergic neurons are variable in size (diameter of cell body = 15-40  microm) and shape (spherical, fusiform, multipolar) (24, 31, 36, 131), and they have been assumed to number from 1,100 to 3,400 in the whole rat brain (61, 143).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Because orexinergic cells have been shown to project to other orexinergic cells within the hypothalamus (69) there might be different populations of orexinergic cells within the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	359	Preproorexin mRNA and protein have even been detected in the ependymal cell layer (97, 143), and orexin A has been found in choroid plexi (31).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	360	 It would be interesting to find out whether this expression occurs in the ependymal cells or, for instance, in neuronal stem cells.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	363	 For orexin A, both smooth and varicose fibers have been observed (31, 143) but varicose fibers appear to be the ones most often seen, although this result might also be caused by the easier detection of this kind of processes.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	364	 A few studies investigating orexin B distribution report projection sites similar to those for orexin A (31, 36).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Almost all the data originate from the rat.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Altogether, orexin receptors are found at the projection sites of orexinergic neurons (see above), which suggests that orexinergic neurons contact many different transmitter systems (see below).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Most of the studies have not specified whether the expression is seen on neurons or other cells, although electrophysiological and other measurements, whenever performed, indicate activation of neurons.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Only in a few cases have synaptic contacts been anatomically shown (48, 55, 70, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Localization of some orexinergic cells/processes close to the ventricular surfaces (24, 31, 97, 143) suggests that orexins could act in paracrine or endocrine fashion.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	395	Similar amounts of OX1 and OX2 mRNA are found in the rat brain as a whole, and OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNAs mostly show similar distribution, although some differences are seen (Fig.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Most interesting are the areas in which essentially only one subtype is expressed (111, 180).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	397	 However, mRNA expression may not directly correspond to receptor protein expression, as discussed by van den Pol et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	398	 The correlation of receptor distribution with different functions of the orexinergic system is shown in Table 3.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	399	 While this article was under review, studies on the expression of OX1 and OX2 receptor protein in the rat CNS were published (30, 64).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	400	 A particularly interesting finding is the expression of OX2 receptor protein in the molecular and granular layers of the cerebellum (30); earlier studies had failed to detect any orexin receptors or their mRNA in the cerebellum although orexinergic fibers were projecting to the cerebellum.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	401	 Otherwise, the immunohistochemical studies suggest a distribution generally similar to that from the mRNA measurements, although some differences are seen.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	402	 For instance, greater overlap of the expression of OX1 and OX2 receptors is suggested on the basis of immunological studies than of in situ hybridization.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	403	 As discussed by the authors, these differences may in some degree be related to the fact that mRNA measurements visualize the expressing cell bodies whereas immunohistochemistry indicates the actual cellular localization of the protein.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Both receptor mRNA and protein measurements are semiquantitative rather than quantitative so they do not allow absolute comparison of subtype expression within any site.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	483	In the original publication dealing with orexins, it was shown that intracerebroventricular injection of orexins induces feeding in rats (154).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	484	 When injected into different hypothalamic sites in the rat, orexin A is effective only in a narrow area (perifornical area, lateral hypothalamus, and dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei but not in preoptic area or arcuate or ventromedial nucleus) whereas orexin B is inactive (39, 173).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	485	 Some of the hypothalamic nuclei possibly involved in feeding responses to orexins are listed in Table 3.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	486	 Intraperitoneally injected OX1 receptor antagonist (SB-334867) inhibits baseline feeding, normal weight gain, and the feeding response to orexin injection in the hypothalamus (62, 150).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	487	 The feeding-stimulating effect of fasting is blocked by intracisternally administered anti-orexin A antibodies (192) and intraperitoneal SB-334867 (62).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	488	 This suggests that at least the OX1 receptor is involved in the natural regulation of feeding, but both orexin receptor subtypes are expressed in the nuclei involved in the regulation of feeding (Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	489	 Orexin A increases c-fos expression in areas of energy regulatory sites within the hypothalamus, the limbic region, and the hindbrain (128).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	490	 As mentioned above (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS), orexins belong to a regulatory network of peptides, including NPY, MCH, AGRP, galanin, POMC products, CART, and dynorphin, which regulate feeding behavior.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	491	 Orexins appear to act upstream of NPY as antagonists to the NPY Y1 or Y5 receptors block orexin-stimulated feeding (38, 81).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	492	The degree to which orexins regulate long-term food intake is subject to debate; some data indicate rather that orexin-induced food intake is only an acute effect and is evened out by compensatory decrease in food intake within 24 h (see, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	493	 It can be speculated that part of orexin-induced food intake is secondary to increased wakefulness and activity and therefore following increased energy expenditure.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	494	 A general view emerging from the different results is that orexins may participate in the short-term regulation of energy homeostasis by initiating feeding in response to falls in glucose, but the subsequent increase in glucose, leptin, and visceral signals would decrease orexin, which in its turn would terminate the behavior after food ingestion (Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	495	 Mapping of orexinergic projections indicates that orexins could also be involved in the overall regulation of feeding.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	496	 For instance, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nucleus, and lamina 1 and 10 of the sacral cord receive afferents from the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, motor trigeminal nucleus, intermediolateral cell column, and sacral parasympathetic nucleus give rise to nerves that innervate the gastrointestinal tract and muscles of mastication (31, 34, 36, 131, 143, 182, 198).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	497	 Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that central orexinergic nerves could be involved in the primary eating process via sensory and motor innervation of the mouth and in the passage of food through the gastrointestinal tract via sensory, motor, and secretomotor innervation of the intestines.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	509	 A profound role of histaminergic systems in these processes is suggested by results that show that these effects of orexin A in the mouse are blocked by histamine H1 receptor antagonists or gene disruption (72, 195).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	510	 Narcoleptic dogs with disrupted OX2 receptors have decreased brain histamine content (134), and OX2 receptor seems to be responsible for orexin effects on the tuberomamillary nucleus even in the rat (44, 195).

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	539	 A CRF receptor antagonist has been reported to block orexin-stimulated plasma corticosterone elevation in the rat (82, 159); on the other hand, orexins have been reported to inhibit CRF-stimulated ACTH release from cultured rat adenohypophysial cells (158).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	540	Orexins have also been reported to stimulate release of corticosterone/cortisol (108, 110, 117) and aldosterone (108, 132) from rat, porcine, or human adrenal glands/adrenal cells in vitro.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	541	 This release is independent of ACTH (110, 117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	542	 Corticosterone/cortisol release has been determined to co-occur with cAMP elevation and probably to depend on it [rat (110), human (117)].
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	543	 This, together with the lack of additivity between orexin A and ACTH, suggests that these peptides utilize the same mechanism for glucocorticoid release (117).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	544	 In contrast, no direct effect on rat adrenal slices was seen by Jaszberenyi et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	545	 In a study with long-term (7 day) exposure to orexin A or orexin B, plasma levels of both aldosterone and corticosterone but not CRF or ACTH were elevated in the rat (108).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	546	Release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from rat adrenal medulla is increased by intracerebroventricular orexins (166), and a similar although smaller effect is seen in cultured porcine adrenal medullar cells (132).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	547	 Both OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNA have been suggested to be expressed in the rat adrenal medulla (104), although other studies present opposing views (84).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	548	Orexin-mediated increases in CRF, ACTH, corticosterone, aldosterone, vasopressin, and epinephrine release suggest that orexins could mediate stress responses.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	549	 Interesting in this context, orexins increase particular stereotypic behavioral patterns, such as grooming, face washing, and burrowing, which may be related to activation of stress response (40, 45, 77, 78).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	550	 Orexin A-induced grooming is inhibited by OX1 receptor block with SB-334867 (40), and a CRF receptor antagonist inhibits orexin-induced face washing and grooming by ~50% and the shift from rest to locomotor activity by 70-80% (78).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	551	 Involvement of complex pathways is highlighted by inhibitory effects of dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonists (40, 115, 130).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	552	 It should be noted that orexins increase wakefulness and/or activity of the rat, and it is therefore important to be able to separate these effects from the stress response.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	553	Effects of orexins on gastrointestinal tract and other organs of feeding/energy metabolism.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	554	 In the gastrointestinal tract, both neurons and some endocrine cells may express orexins (92, 133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	555	 In neurons, orexin immunoreactivity is seen both in the submucosal and myenteric plexi.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	556	 Orexinergic neurons in these plexi have been suggested to be sensory or secretomotor on the basis of the coexpression of other markers such as VIP and choline acetyltransferase (92, 133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	557	 The neurites project to other orexin-containing cells and to mucosa, muscle layers, and submucosal blood vessels.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	558	 In the guinea pig, all the orexin-positive neurons of submucosal and myenteric plexi express leptin receptors as well (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	559	 Fasting increases the number of orexin A-immunoreactive submucosal neurons in the guinea pig, most of which also become positive for phospho-cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	560	 This, similar to c-fos expression, indicates activation of the neurons, suggesting that fasting activates both central and peripheral orexinergic systems.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	561	Also, some endocrine cells in the gut and stomachsome of which are enterochromaffin as they express serotonindisplay orexin immunoreactivity in mouse, rat, guinea pig, and human (92, 133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	562	 Interestingly, some enterochromaffin cells of the rat also 1) express orexin receptors (OX2) and 2) are localized at close proximity to orexinergic nerve fibers (133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	563	 At the cellular level, orexin A induces electrical responses in guinea pig submucosal neurons (see CELLULAR RESPONSES TO OREXINS).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	564	 Thus orexinergic neurons in the gastrointestinal tract could affect intestinal secretion and uptake, endocrine secretion, sensory signaling, and intestinal motility.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	565	 Different effects on intestinal motility patterns have indeed been measured in mouse and rat small intestine (133, 160) and in guinea pig distal colon (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	566	 Different orexin receptor subtypes have different distribution in the gastrointestinal tract; OX1 receptor immunoreactivity is solely expressed by the submucosal and myenteric neurons, whereas OX2 receptor immunoreactivity is only seen in the enterochromaffin cells in the rat (133).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	567	Energy metabolism is regulated by several hormones, the most important being pancreatic glucagon and insulin, hypophysial growth hormone, glucocorticoids, (nor)epinephrine, and thyroid hormones.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	568	 Effects of orexins on glucocorticoid and growth hormone release have been discussed above.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	569	 Insulin release is somewhat increased in the rat by both intracerebroventricular (114) and subcutaneous (137, 174) injection of orexin A, and also in the rat pancreas in vitro (137).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	570	 Extrinsic neurons in rat and guinea pig pancreatic ganglia display orexin and OX1 and OX2 receptor immunoreactivity (92).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	571	 Plasma leptin is also increased by subcutaneous injection of orexin A or -B in the rat, although this has been suggested to occur via increased insulin release (174).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	572	Narcolepsy, a Disorder of the Orexinergic System.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	573	Narcolepsy is a disorder that in short can be characterized as abnormal inclusion of REM sleep features, such as muscle paralysis and hallucinations in the waking state and in the sleep/waking transition state.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	574	 In addition, hypersomnia is often observed.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	575	 Narcolepsy in humans is usually a sporadic disease; its strong association with some major histocompatibility complex antigens (especially HLA-DRB1*15, HLA-DQA1*0102, and HLA-DQB1*0602) has for a long time been suggested to relate it to some autoimmune process.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	576	 Yet autoantibodies or signs of ongoing or previous inflammation have been hard to find (reviewed in Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	577	 This could, however, be caused 1) by the fact that postmortem narcoleptic brains are usually investigated years after disease onset and 2) by the dispersed nature of the orexinergic cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	578	 Orexin A is undetectable in the CSF of most human narcoleptic patients (32, 135), the number of orexinergic neurons in postmortem narcoleptic brains is much reduced (142, 178), and even signs of gliosis have been observed (178).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	579	 At the same time MCHergic neurons, at the same brain areas, are present in normal numbers (142, 178).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	580	 This, together with the animal model systems (see below), has led to the hypothesis of narcolepsy as a disease of orexinergic neurons.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	581	 As further support for this, only one clearly debilitating preproorexin or orexin receptor mutation has been found in human subjects (Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	582	In the mouse, depletion of the hypothalamus of orexins results in a narcoleptic phenotype.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	583	 This has been accomplished by genetic disruption of the preproorexin gene (orexin knockout mouse; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	584	 23), genetic destruction of orexinergic cells in preproorexin-ataxin-3 knockin mouse (60), and toxic destruction of orexinergic cells by hypothalamic injection of orexin B-saporin conjugate (52).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	585	In dogs, narcolepsy is mainly a familial disorder.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	586	 Recently, familial canine narcolepsy of Doberman pinschers and Labrador retrievers was shown to be caused by mutations in the OX2 receptor gene (102).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	587	 In both cases, the mutations cause premature amino acid chain termination.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	588	 When expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells, the mutant receptors mainly remain in the intracellular compartments and neither bind orexin A nor activate Ca2+ mobilization (73).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	589	 Point mutation Glu54Lys at the NH2 terminus/first transmembrane segment junction of the OX2 receptor also leads to reduced orexin A binding and 400-fold reduced potency for Ca2+ elevation when expressed in HEK293 cells (73).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	590	 The 10 other reported mutations in preproorexin or OX2 receptor genes are thought to represent benign polymorphisms (73).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	591	 Sporadic cases of canine narcolepsy have been suggested to be caused by lack of orexins (148).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	592	OX1 or OX2 receptor gene abnormalities are not considered to be responsible for human narcoleptic cases, and the 26 single-base changes (11 aa changes) found in healthy and narcoleptic human subjects (Refs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	593	 139, 142; see also Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins) both in introns and all over the coding regions are supposed to represent benign polymorphisms.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	594	 One other polymorphism concerns the reported sequence for the OX1 receptors (aa 280; see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), although this could be a sequencing error.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	595	 One mutation, Leu16Arg, found in the 5'-signal peptide region of the human preproorexin gene probably results in early-onset, severe narcolepsy (142).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	596	 When transiently expressed in Neuro-2A cells, the mutated peptide apparently accumulated in some tubular network, presumably smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in contrast to the wild-type preproorexin, which appeared in vesicles.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	597	 Another point mutation in the 5'-untranslated region may be involved in disease process in the presence of a particular type of tissue antigen (HLA-DR2; Ref.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	598	 Insertion of an adenosine at 593 (promoter region) has been found in one narcoleptic patient, although the effect of this on pathogenicity is unclear (51).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	599	Thus there is strong evidence that narcolepsy is caused by reduced orexinergic signaling via either destruction of orexinergic neurons or defective orexin peptides or receptors, although larger population studies are necessary to confirm this.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	600	 OX2 receptor appears to be especially involved in the dog, which would promote the role of nuclei relying on this receptor subtype, such as tuberomamillary nucleus, although it is possible that OX1 and OX2 receptors have different distributions in rats and humans compared with dogs.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	601	Orexinergic disorders may also provide some interesting information on the role of orexins in feeding.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	602	 Patients with narcolepsy show somewhat increased body mass index compared with healthy subjects (162).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	603	 Both of the two previously described kinds of orexin-transgenic mice are hypophagic, but preproorexin knockout mice are lean (23) as opposed to orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which are obese (60).
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	604	 It is thus possible that preproorexin knockout mice develop some compensatory mechanisms for weight regulation whereas orexinergic neuron-deficient mice, which lose their orexinergic neurons postnatally (see Genetics and Chemistry of Orexins), will not be able to do this.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	605	 Another interesting possibility was recently proposed by Chou et al.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	606	 Essentially all the mouse lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons express dynorphin (10, 27), removal of which in orexinergic neuron-deficient mice might be responsible for the more pronounced phenotype.

0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	610	Although the anatomic architecture of the orexinergic system in the CNS is well characterized, there are several open questions as to the actual roles of orexins in central and peripheral functions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	611	 What are the mechanisms of action of orexins at the cellular level? Have all orexin receptors been identified? Are there presynaptic inhibitory orexin receptors in the brain? The limited access to orexin-responding neurons is an experimental problem.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	612	 There are several limitations concerning the methods available for the characterization of the functional properties of these cells in slice preparations or acutely isolated cells.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	613	 Model systems based on cultured neurons or even neuronal stem cells might provide an important improvement for studies of orexin signaling.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	614	 The CHO cell lines available have provided insight in functions of the orexinergic system and have enabled screening for orexin receptor ligands, but all the data obtained may not be relevant for the nervous system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	615	 Recombinant models based on neurons or neuronlike cells might therefore provide further information about the signal pathways used by orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	616	What role do the orexin cells play in the regulation of feeding? Available information suggests that at least one population of the orexinergic cells in the lateral hypothalamus directly monitors and responds to changes in glucose concentration in their environment and may also directly respond to signals inhibiting feeding such as leptin.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	617	 Are these orexinergic cells the ones that project to areas in brain involved in feeding behavior? Orexin receptors are expressed in high numbers in several regions within the hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	618	 Do these regulate the release of other feeding-related neurotransmitters? The regulation of feeding seems to be complex, involving many other neuropeptides, and there seems to be a gross redundancy in the system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	619	 Blocking of the orexinergic system by various means will reduce feeding, but permanent deletion of the orexinergic system has marginal or controversial effects.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	620	 Thus even an increase rather than the expected decrease in body mass may occur on deletions of different components of the orexinergic system.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	621	The role of orexins in sleep seems clearer in light of the connection of the narcoleptic phenotype to orexin cell loss and the similar symptomatology occurring in functional orexin or orexin receptor loss.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	622	 In this context it also appears quite clear that a major part of orexin effects is mediated via monoaminergic systems, which regulate cholinergic pathways involved in the initiation of REM sleep (reviewed in, e.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	623	 Yet it is unclear how the activity of the orexinergic cells themselves is regulated.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	624	 Use of orexin antagonists as hypnotics could prove rewarding because many commonly used hypnotics interfere with REM sleep and cause tolerance, addiction, and memory disturbances.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	625	 An interesting question is whether there is an overlap between cells regulating feeding and sleep in the lateral hypothalamus.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	626	 Is, for instance, feeding behavior associated with arousal effects of orexins? Possibilities in the future to devise better pharmacological methods for identification of different orexinergic neurons as well as for manipulating their function will hopefully give answers to these questions.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	627	One of the most intriguing questions concerns what roles orexins play in the periphery.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	628	 Do they act as hormones/paracrine mediators? The presence of orexins and their receptors in many peripheral organs such as the intestine, endocrine pancreas, adrenals, and pituitary suggests that this may be the case.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	629	 Could orexins even transmit signals from the periphery to the CNS? As discussed above, the few studies available suggest separate "peripheral" and "central" orexinergic systems.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	630	 In some studies changes in central orexin concentrations are not reflected in the periphery, and in narcoleptics devoid of central orexins, orexins are still found in the plasma.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	631	 This may indicate that the plasma orexin levels reflect peripherally produced orexins.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	632	 Are the peripheral orexin receptors similar to the central? At least in the adrenal cortical zona fasciculata/reticularis orexin receptors appear to couple to cAMP elevation and not to Ca2+ elevation.
0.35575834.12419707.html.plaintext.txt	633	 Does this reflect different receptor subtypesas suggested by some studiesor coupling to different signal pathways? Cell lines and primary cultures from peripheral tissues should provide a lot of the missing information in this context.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	6	Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder caused by impaired hypocretin (orexin) neurotransmission.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Growth hormone (GH) secretion may be altered in narcolepsy for various reasons.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Slow-wave sleep episodes, which are closely associated with GH-secretory events, are more randomly dispersed over 24 h in narcoleptics.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, hypocretins may inhibit pituitary GH release.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We assessed the function of the somatotropic axis in narcolepsy by deconvolving 24-h (10-min sampling interval) plasma GH concentration profiles in seven hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic patients and in seven healthy controls matched for age, sex, and body weight.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both basal and pulsatile GH secretion rate and secretagogue-induced GH release were similar in patients and controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, narcoleptics secreted ~50% of their total production during the daytime, whereas controls secreted only 25% during the day.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Also, the GH output pattern of narcoleptics was significantly less regular.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We propose that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian distribution of hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone release in narcoleptic patients to simultaneously cause daytime GH release and promote their propensity to fall asleep during the day.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	16	NARCOLEPSY PRIMARILY AFFECTS the organization and regulation of sleep and wakefulness.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Its main symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and fragmented nocturnal sleep (20).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Narcolepsy is caused by disruption of hypocretin (orexin)-mediated neurotransmission (7, 16, 21).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The vast majority of human patients lack hypocretin in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17, 18, 28).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	20	 An autoimmune-mediated destruction of hypocretin neurons is currently presumed to be the principal cause of narcolepsy in humans (21, 30).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	21	Sleep and the activity of the somatotropic axis are intimately related (33).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In particular, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is associated with pituitary growth hormone (GH) release.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In healthy individuals, a major GH-secretory event occurs often shortly after sleep onset, in close temporal association with the first period of SWS.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Conversely, sleep deprivation is consistently associated with a reduction of circulating GH levels, and the age-related decline of SWS is accompanied by a marked decrease of GH secretion (32).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because SWS episodes are more randomly distributed over 24 h in narcoleptic patients than in healthy subjects (5, 6), the circadian distribution of GH-secretory events may be altered in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, because intracerebroventricular injection of hypocretin-1 causes a dose-dependent reduction of plasma GH in rats (13), hypocretin deficiency may exert a direct excitatory effect on GH release in narcoleptics.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	27	Only a limited number of studies have assessed the status of the somatotropic axis in narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In general, these studies have suggested that the rise of plasma GH concentrations around sleep onset is markedly dampened or even absent in narcolepsy (2, 8, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It was hypothesized that an intrinsic disturbance of SWS and/or the frequent occurrence of sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods underlies these alterations in GH secretion in narcoleptic humans (33).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, the interpretation of data obtained in these early studies was hampered by methodological imperfections, particularly with respect to the selection of control subjects [e.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	31	, not matched for age and/or body mass index (BMI)].
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, in the course of time, novel analytical techniques [deconvolution and approximate entropy (ApEn)] have been developed, which allow estimation of the pituitary GH secretion rate and quantification of the orderliness of the release process on the basis of frequently sampled plasma GH concentration time series (24, 34, 38).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	33	To further evaluate the impact of a disturbance of circadian (slow-wave) sleep distribution and/or hypocretin deficiency on various features of pulsatile GH secretion in humans, we deconvolved 24-h plasma GH concentration profiles in narcoleptic patients and in healthy controls matched for age, sex, and BMI.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We specifically hypothesized that the circadian distribution of peaks and troughs of plasma GH concentrations would be disrupted and that the total daily GH production would be increased in narcoleptic patients.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We included seven male patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The diagnosis was confirmed by Multiple Sleep Latency Testing, which showed results typical for narcolepsy (1).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	40	 All patients were HLA-DQB1*0602 positive.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We confirmed that all patients were hypocretin deficient: hypocretin-1 was undetectable in the CSF with direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (28).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The subjects, except three (two using psychostimulants, and one using clomipramine), who discontinued their medication for 2 wk before the study, were free of medication.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	43	Weight and height of all subjects were measured, as well as waist and hip circumference (waist halfway between the lowest rib and crista iliaca, and hip as the maximum circumference in standing position).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was used as a relative measure of abdominal fat mass.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Total body fat mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR4500, Waltham, MA) (3).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	46	We recruited seven male control subjects through advertisements in local newspapers.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Controls were matched for age, BMI, total fat mass, and WHR.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Serum IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) concentrations were measured only once in an early morning sample.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	65	After the 24-h sampling procedure, at 0900 the next morning, 50  microg of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) were given as an intravenous bolus, and serum GH concentrations were measured in blood samples taken every 10 min for 90 min after bolus injection (31).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Serum GH concentrations were measured using a sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (Wallac, Turku, Finland).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The assay is specific for the 22-kDa GH isoform.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Human biosynthetic GH (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) diluted in bovine calf serum was used as a standard, which was calibrated against the World Health Organization First International Reference Preparation 80-505 (1  microg = 2.

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	72	 All samples from one subject were measured in the same assay.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Total serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations were measured by RIA as previously described (23).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	74	 During the 24-h sampling procedure, sleep was recorded polygraphically using a Porti-5 ambulant electroencephalogram recording system (Twente Medical Systems International, Enschede, Netherlands) and scored on EEG-2100 review software (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	75	 An experienced technician, blinded for the subject under study, visually scored the sleep recordings at 30-s epochs by means of standardized criteria (27).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Nocturnal sleep onset was identified as the first epoch of stages II, III, IV, or REM sleep after lights off, provided that the subsequent interval was not scored as wake.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The sleep period was defined as the time between sleep onset and final awakening in the morning.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Sleep efficiency was calculated as the percentage of the sleep period actually spent asleep.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	79	 For the GH time series, we used multiple-parameter deconvolution analysis to estimate various specific measures of pulsatile secretion and half-life on the basis of simultaneous consideration of all serum hormone concentrations and their dose-dependent intrasample variances (35, 37).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Results are expressed as milliunits per liter of distribution volume (mU/lD).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The following parameters were estimated in the GH series: number of secretory bursts, secretory burst half-duration (duration at half-maximal amplitude), burst amplitude, mean mass secreted per burst, hormone half-life, pulsatile secretion rate, basal secretion rate, and total secretion per 24 h.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Furthermore, we quantified the amount of GH secreted from 0900 to 2300 and from 2300 to 0900 during the 3 h before and after sleep onset and during the first secretory burst after sleep onset.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	83	We quantified the minute-to-minute regularity ("serial orderliness") of GH secretion by use of the ApEn statistic, a scale- and model-independent metric (24).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	84	 ApEn estimates the regularity of subordinate (nonpulsatile) patterns in the data and as such yields information complementary to deconvolution techniques (25, 39).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Greater regularity yields smaller ApEn values, whereas greater independence among sequential values of a time series yields larger ApEn values.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	86	 We applied normalized ApEn parameters of m = 1 and r = 20% of the intraseries SD, as previously validated for GH series of this length (26).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The ApEn ratio delineates the orderliness of a concentration time series compared with the ApEn score associated with maximal randomness in the same time series as estimated by computer simulation.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Thus an ApEn ratio equal to 1 reflects maximal randomness in the time series under study, and smaller ApEn ratios denote greater regularity.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	89	GH release in response to GHRH injection was determined using deconvolution analysis (see above).

0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	150	We assessed 24-h sleep patterns and GH secretion profiles conjointly in a well-defined group of narcoleptic patients and controls who were matched for various confounding variables.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The patients had several daytime naps, including SWS episodes, whereas sleep was confined to nighttime in controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Total daily GH production was strongly correlated with the total time of SWS in narcoleptic patients and controls alike (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	153	 As a result, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and (slow-wave) sleep epochs over 24 h was altered concomitantly in narcoleptics such that they secreted a larger fraction of their total GH production during the day (48 vs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The GH output pattern was significantly less regular in the narcoleptic patients.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Against expectations, both basal and pulsatile GH production and secretagogue-induced GH release were similar in patients and controls (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	156	Only a few previous studies have examined plasma GH concentrations in patients with narcolepsy.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The results of these studies generally suggested that GH release (both spontaneous 24-h and secretagogue-induced) is blunted in narcoleptics (2, 8, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, interpretation of the data obtained in these studies is hampered by potential imperfections regarding the selection of control subjects.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	159	 For example, in two of the studies (2, 15), body weight of the participants was not reported, and a third study (8) did not include healthy control subjects at all.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We now know that narcoleptic patients tend to be obese (9) and that GH production is profoundly reduced in (abdominally) obese humans (23, 36).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Also, age was reported in only two studies (2, 15).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In one of these (15), the narcoleptic patients were ~10 yr older than the controls (32 vs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	163	 24 yr), which may also have biased the results (32).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In the present study, the control subjects were carefully matched with respect to age, sex, BMI, and body fat distribution to preclude analogous bias.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Therefore, we believe that the data presented in the present paper are more conclusive than any previous study as to whether narcolepsy per se impacts GH secretion.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Moreover, the narcoleptic patients in the present study were confirmed to be hypocretin deficient, which was not possible to determine in any of the previous studies (as hypocretin peptides were unknown at that time).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Thus the present data pertain specifically to hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Our results clearly argue against a reduction of spontaneous or secretagogue-induced GH secretion in human narcolepsy.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	169	What can we learn about the regulation of GH secretion and sleep from the results of this study? First, the onset of nocturnal sleep remains an important correlate of GH release, even when numerous naps have interrupted daytime wakefulness.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Both in narcoleptics and in controls, ~30% of total daily GH secretion occurred in the 3 h after nocturnal sleep onset.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Second, the relationship between SWS and GH release remains robust, even if sleep is fragmented and more randomly dispersed over 24 h.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	172	 A strong, positive, and highly significant correlation between both variables was observed in narcoleptics and in controls.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Third, the dispersion of GH-secretory events and sleep epochs over 24 h appears to be altered analogously in narcoleptic patients: they had more (slow-wave) sleep time and more GH secretion during the day.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Finally, endogenous hypocretins do not significantly impact the amount of GH that is produced daily in humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	175	The hypocretin peptides (hypocretin-1 and -2, also known as orexin A and B) are produced exclusively by a small number of neurons located in the perifornical area of the hypothalamus (10, 29).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Hypocretin neurons connect with other nuclei within the hypothalamus (including the arcuate nucleus) and the pituitary (22) to explain their impact on energy balance and several neuroendocrine ensembles (for reviews, see Refs.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Intracerebroventricular administration of hypocretin-1 causes a dose-dependent decrease of plasma GH in rats (13).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Furthermore, it was recently reported that somatotropic cells in the human pituitary express the hypocretin receptor-1 (4).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These data suggest that hypocretins directly blunt GH secretion.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	180	 We therefore hypothesized that hypocretin deficiency would enhance total daily GH production in narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Our results do not support this contention, as narcoleptic patients produced normal total amounts of GH (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, we do believe that our data support the thesis that hypocretin deficiency disrupts the circadian dispersion of hypothalamic GHRH release, which normally confines sleep and GH secretion to the night.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	183	Sleep and the activity of the somatotropic axis are intimately related (33).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The most reproducible GH-secretory event in humans occurs around nocturnal sleep onset, in close temporal association with the first epoch of SWS (see Ref.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The secretion of GH is controlled mainly by two hypothalamic peptides, GHRH and somatostatin (12, 14).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	186	 A large body of evidence suggests that GHRH simultaneously promotes sleep and GH release, which can explain the consistent association between sleep and GH secretion (see Ref.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The present study shows that this dual regulatory effect of GHRH is probably intact in narcoleptics, as SWS and GH release remain closely associated in these patients (Fig.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This inference may imply that the circadian distribution of hypothalamic GHRH release is disrupted in narcolepsy to simultaneously cause diurnal GH secretion and enhance daytime sleepiness.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Specifically, the hypocretin system, which is particularly active during the day (11), may normally inhibit hypothalamic GHRH secretion to promote arousal and reduce pituitary GH output.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Conversely, diminution of hypocretin tonus at night (11) may relax inhibitory restraint of GHRH release to dampen arousal and increase GH output.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In this scenario, hypocretin deficiency particularly enhances GHRH release during the day (when the system normally has its peak activity) to concurrently promote daytime GH secretion and compromise daytime wakefulness in narcoleptic patients.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	192	The irregular GH output pattern we found in narcoleptics also supports the notion that hypothalamic GHRH release may be enhanced in this disorder.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The serial orderliness of pulsatile GH release, as determined by the ApEn statistic, reflects the balance of feedforward and feedback inputs into the somatotropic neuroendocrine ensemble (40).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In the present study, GH output was more irregular in narcoleptic patients than in their healthy controls, which suggests that negative feedback restraint of somatotropic activity is muted and/or that positive feedforward inputs are enhanced in narcolepsy (40).
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	195	In conclusion, this study documents irregular release of normal amounts of GH in hypocretin-deficient narcoleptic humans.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In addition, the circadian dispersion of GH-secretory events is altered in narcoleptics, so that a relatively large fraction of total production occurs during the daytime.
0.5774776.12453828.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We propose that an altered circadian distribution of GHRH release, brought about by hypocretin deficiency, simultaneously causes increased daytime GH secretion and enhanced daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Orexin A and B are involved in feeding behaviors, and recently fibers containing these peptides were found in the rat olfactory bulb.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These fibers, which originate from the lateral and posterior hypothalamus and the perifornical area, are distributed in the glomerular, mitral cell, and granule cell layers.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Orexin receptors are mainly expressed by mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the present study, RT-PCR experiments were done to determine orexin receptor expression during the early postnatal life of rats, and immunocytochemical experiments were performed to further clarify the structural and ultrastructural localization of orexin receptors in the olfactory bulb.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Furthermore, a functional electrophysiological approach examined the action of orexin A on mitral cell excitability and spontaneous activity using in vitro patch-clamp techniques.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	12	 RT-PCR results show that mRNA of the two type receptors, type 1 orexin receptors and type 2 orexin receptors, are expressed in the olfactory bulb of rat from 10 d to the adult stage.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	13	 At the same ages, immunocytochemical data show that orexin 1 receptors are localized in the cell bodies of periglomerular, mitral/tufted, and granule cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in mitral/tufted cell dendrites arborizing in the glomerulus and mitral/tufted and granule cell processes running in the external plexiform layer.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Functionally, orexin A produced either a direct, tetrodotoxin-insensitive depolarization in one group of mitral cells (7%), or, in another group (30%), an indirect, tetrodotoxin-sensitive hyperpolarization.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Both actions were mediated by type 1 orexin receptors because the response was antagonized by SB-334867-A, a selective antagonist.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Mitral cell recordings performed under bicuculline [-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonist], indicate that the orexin-induced indirect hyperpolarization was partly mediated through GABAA receptors.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Because granule cells and periglomerular cells express orexin receptors and are GABAergic cells, they could be both involved in this hyperpolarization.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other mechanisms, which could support an indirect hyperpolarization of mitral cells through dopamine interneuron solicitation, are proposed.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Our results provide data that should allow us to better understand neural communication and regulation mechanisms between the hypothalamic feeding centers and the olfactory bulb.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	21	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   MANY ANIMAL BEHAVIORS are triggered by odorant cues from the environment, and in particular, food odors are among the major determinants for food choice and food learning.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It has been clear for several years that the olfactory system is involved in feeding behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The nutritional status of the animal was shown to influence reactivity to food odors of mitral cells; the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For example, it had been demonstrated that in fasted rats, 70% of mitral cells were stimulated by food odor stimulation vs.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	25	 12% for a nonfood odor, whereas in fed animals only 11% responded to food odors (6).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	26	Conversely, it was shown that odors regulate food intake behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Indeed, Le Magnen (7) showed that rats increased their food intake if, once satiated, they were presented with differently odorized foods.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, it is an everyday experience for humans and animals that food odors are attractive before feeding, whereas the same stimuli may become neutral or even aversive after feeding.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Sensory olfactory inputs are thus crucial in nutrition behavior of humans and animals.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Olfactory system involvement begins with the food search step because olfactory sensitivity levels provide the signal detection that allows the animals to follow the concentration gradient toward the food source.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Then the olfactory system contributes to the palatability analysis of the food; the appetence of the animal for food is defined by its internal physiological status.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	32	Hypothalamic feeding centers (8) analyze metabolic cues and in turn regulate the appetite.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These centers send direct and specific projections to olfactory structures, especially on the olfactory bulb (OB), the first integrative relay of the system (9, 10, 11, 12, 13).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The discovery of orexin A (OXA) and B (OXB) or hypocretin I and II (11, 13), two peptides derived from the same prepropeptide and contained in neurons localized in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area, provided new insights into the regulation mechanisms of feeding.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Orexin (OX) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area are controlled by changes in circulating nutriment because they are activated by natural hypoglycemic conditions (14) or insulin-induced ones (15), whereas they are inhibited by glucose and signals related to the ingestion of food (15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These data led to the classification of OX neurons of the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical area as glucose-sensitive neurons (20).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, OX neurons are stimulated by an increase of circulating lipids.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Thus, OX neurons are negatively related to the glucose level but inversely related to circulating fat (21), the latter relation suggesting a role of this peptide in the increased activity associated with a high-fat diet (22, 23).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	39	The majority of physiological studies (for reviews see Refs.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	40	 24 and 25) indicate that orexins are potent stimulators of food intake (26, 27), with OXA being more effective than OXB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Moreover these peptides interact with various neuronal pathways to potentiate apparently divergent functions (for review see Ref.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Currently two closely related G protein-coupled receptor types termed type 1 orexin receptors (ORX1) and type 2 orexin receptors (ORX2) have been identified.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Although OXA has the same affinity for ORX1 and ORX2, OXB has a 10-fold greater affinity for ORX2 (13, 29, 30).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (31) demonstrated that in the OB, immunoreactive OXA varicose fibers were mainly around glomeruli, in mitral cell and granule cell layers.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Glomeruli are spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery in which primary axons synapse with mitral cells; they are delimited by GABAergic interneurons called periglomerular cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Granule cells are deep GABAergic inhibitory interneurons.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The localization of OXB labeling paralleled that of OXA.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	48	 However, immunoreactivity to ORX1 and ORX2 were detected only in some mitral/tufted cell bodies, ORX2 labeling being very faint (31).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	49	 This localization may support, at least partly, data reporting that OB mitral cell reactivity to odors was modulated according to hunger and satiation states in rats (3).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	50	Our exploration of OX actions on the OB network should provide a better understanding of the cross-talk between olfactory and metabolic cues in the brain, as being at the basis of nutritional behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This study analyzed specifically OX action on mitral cells, its putative cell targets in the OB (31), through an in vitro patch-clamp study.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	52	 To do so, the actions of OXA and SB-334867-A (ORX1 antagonist; GlaxoSmithKline, Harlow, Essex, UK) were tested on the spontaneous activity and excitability of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Furthermore, an immunocytochemical study was done to clarify cellular and subcellular localizations of ORX1, the most expressed orexin receptor in the OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In addition, because no data are available on the early ontogenetic development of orexin innervation and orexin receptors in the OB and because electrophysiological studies on slices were performed on 10- to 25-d-old-rats, the presence of ORX1 was evaluated through RT-PCR experiments on rats and adults that were 10 to 25 postnatal days (P) old.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Altogether, the data are expected to provide some enlightenment about the neurochemical modulatory effect of OXA on OB activity and to reveal what cell types of the bulbar network are the targets of orexin innervations.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Furthermore, this first functional study is expected to give rise to preliminary hypotheses dealing with the role of the olfactory system in the regulation of food-intake processes.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	282	 However, until now, no data about the development of orexin innervation and orexin receptor expression were available in this tissue.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Through RT-PCR experiments, we present information of orexin receptor mRNA in the OB during early postnatal development.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Our results indicate that both ORX1 and ORX2 are expressed as early as 10 d after birth (P10) and their presence is shown until the adult stage both in control tissues (HYPO) and OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Although only a quantitative RT-PCR could lead us to a more definitive conclusion, our study suggests that both ORX1 and ORX2 are expressed at a lower level in OB, compared with HYPO.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Noteworthy is that our results show a stable level of ORX1 expression before weaning as well as in adults.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Other brain tissues, such as hypoglossal neurons (42) or hypothalamus (43), show higher expression levels at P20 to 25 and a stable level thereafter.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	288	 From a functional point of view, Van den Pol et al.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	289	 (44) report that the orexin system is functional during early brain development and show that at P10, orexin induces a robust synaptic activity in hypothalamic neurons.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Altogether our results and those on hypothalamic structures convinced us to perform our electrophysiological recordings on P10 to 25 rats.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	291	Furthermore, from our anatomical results, it appears that the cellular localization of ORX1 is similar in preweaning and adult rats.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	292	 At light microscopic level, our immunocytochemical study confirms the localization of ORX1 in mitral/tufted cell bodies reported by Caillol et al.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	293	 At the ultrastructural level, the localization of orexin receptors has been not widely studied; there is only one recent publication in the arcuate nucleus (45).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Our results are in agreement with this study showing that ORX1 was localized in cell bodies as well as at the pre- and postsynaptic levels.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In our study, a part of the labeling is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a local synthesis of ORX1.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	296	 ORX1 immunoreactivity was also shown in mitral/tufted cell dendrites running in the EPL and in bodies and processes of external tuft cells and periglomerular and granule cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Thus, ORX1 seems to be expressed by most OB cell categories but not in a systematic and homogeneous way.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Indeed, ORX1 labeling is homogeneously distributed neither along the mitral cell layer nor in the glomerular layer.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Interestingly, ORX1 immunoreactive mitral cell bodies were found in most cases adjacent to ORX1 immunoreactive glomeruli.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Although such an observation needs to be further documented, it may suggest some columnar organization of orexin receptive cells in the OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	301	To optimize in vitro neuron survival, electrophysiological recordings were performed on 10- to 25-d-old rats, a period surrounding weaning.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	302	 During this period, ingestive behavior evolves: the type of food changes from a liquid diet full of fat to a solid diet with less fat.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, in our experimental conditions, we observed that weaning is progressive because developing rats can both suck at their mothers  nipples and eat solid food, which is available ad libitum (for the dam).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Furthermore, most of recordings (75%) were made from 20- to 25-d-old rats, and no obvious variability due to different ages of rats was observed in mitral cell reactivity to OXA.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	305	Our results show that OXA modulates mitral cell activity.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Only 61 mitral cells (30%) were shown to be modulated by OXA, with 7 and 23% being depolarized and hyperpolarized, respectively.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	307	 These results are in agreement with our immunocytochemical observations, which indicate that rather few mitral cells were ORX1 immunoreactive.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	308	OXA is shown to exert two opposite effects on two distinct sets of mitral cells: either a direct depolarizing effect, by inducing a TTX-insensitive inward current, or an indirect hyperpolarizing effect.

0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	312	 From the olfactory mucosa, olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) send their axons to the OB terminating in glomeruli (GLO), spherical neuropiles lying at the OB periphery.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Within glomeruli, these axons synapse with primary dendrites (pd) of mitral cells (MC).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Mitral cells make reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with the two categories of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons; through their pd with PGs and through their secondary dendrites (sd) with granule cells (GC).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	315	 So mitral cell activity can be modulated through a double-GABAergic control before sending their axon (a) to the olfactory cortex.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	316	 ORX1 is found to be expressed by subsets of MC, PG, and GC (cells in dark gray) and tufted cells (Tc, in light gray), these receptors being localized in the soma and processes of these neurons.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Left, The diagram schematizes the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA on MC: OXA, by acting through ORX1, is hypothesized to depolarize GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, PGs, or GCs (in dark gray), which in turn would inhibit MCs (in white) via a GABA release acting on GABAA receptors localized on the MC.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Within glomeruli, a part of OXA indirect hyperpolarizing action can also be ascribed to action of GABA released by PGs on GABAB receptors localized both on ORN axons or MCs (pd).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Right, The diagram is schematizes the direct depolarizing action of OXA on MC; OXA, by acting through ORX1 expressed by a subset of mitral cells, is hypothesized to depolarize MC (dark gray).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	320	  The hyperpolarizing action of OXA was sufficient to completely shut off mitral cell spontaneous activity and was antagonized by the voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker TTX.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	321	 The latter observation supports that OXA action was indirect.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Such OXA indirect effects were reported in other brain area like the substantia nigra (34), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (46), HYPO (47), or raphe nucleus (43).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	323	 These OXA effects were either excitatory or inhibitory.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	324	We show that the OXA hyperpolarizing response was partly antagonized by the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This result indicates that GABAergic interneurons are involved in the OXA-induced hyperpolarization of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Our immunocytochemical observations that some PG and granule cell bodies express ORX1 support that these GABAergic interneurons could be contacted by orexin fibers localized mainly in glomerular layer and feebly in granule cell layer (31).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Indeed, PG and granule cells, the main interneurons of these two layers, are mainly GABAergic (49, 50) and have been shown to inhibit mitral cells by activation of GABAA receptors (51, 52).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Along the same line, GABAergic interneurons that are excited by OXA may act on metabotropic GABAB receptors.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Indeed, GABAB receptor activation was reported elsewhere to both abolish completely spontaneous activity in mitral cells and decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks applied in the olfactory nerve layer (33, 53, 54).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	330	In the present study, OXA was also observed to decrease mitral cell excitability to electrical shocks.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	331	 For such an effect, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on extrasynaptic presynaptic GABAB receptors located on primary afferent axons (55, 56) in which it is strongly suspected to act by depressing neurotransmitter release (54, 57, 58, 59, 60).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	332	 On the other hand, for decreasing mitral cell spontaneous activity, OXA-induced GABA-release may act on GABAB receptors located either on the soma or dendritic intraglomerular tuft of rat mitral cells (55, 56).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	333	 One of the mechanisms by which GABAB would silence the spontaneous activity may be that GABAB would slightly hyperpolarize mitral cells at rest, shifting the cell polarization from the up-state to the down-state, the latter signaling a steady silent state (61).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Because dopamine and GABA are colocalized in some PG interneurons (62, 63, 64), dopamine also would be a good candidate to support the OXA indirect inhibition of mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Consistent with this hypothesis is that, in the frog OB, dopamine was found to inhibit mitral cell spontaneous activity (65).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	336	 A coaction of GABA and dopamine cannot be ruled out.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	337	An especially interesting fact is that our electrophysiological results are fully consistent with those of an in vivo study (48).
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The authors recorded unit extracellular activity of mitral cells in anesthetized rats, whereas they applied OXA directly on the OB surface or in the lateral ventricle.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Both types of applications were shown to induce a decrease in spontaneous rate of some cells or an increase in others distinct cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Noteworthy is that in both in vivo and in vitro studies, OXA induces two types of opposite actions on mitral cell spontaneous activity.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	341	As a conclusion, our study brings out information on the ontogenetic expression of orexin receptors in the rat OB and clarifies ORX1 structural and ultrastructural localization within the network.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	342	 In addition, our in vitro recordings demonstrate that OXA acts on mitral cells both directly and indirectly inducing apparently opposite effects.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The direct depolarizing effect could be mediated by ORX1 located on mitral cell bodies and dendrites.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	344	 ORX1 located on PG and granular cells could be responsible for the indirect hyperpolarizing action of OXA via GABA-induced release.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	345	Altogether our data provide new insights for apprehending some of the mechanisms by which the olfactory system is involved in the regulation of food-intake behavior.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In hungry animals, hypothalamic OX neurons are stimulated by hypoglycemia (14) and probably increase their release through centrifugal pathways.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Our electrophysiological data detail OX action in OB.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Indeed, by acting both directly by increasing output neuron s background activity and, indirectly through inhibitory interneuron networks, OX can both depress and excite mitral cells.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	349	 These two opposite actions are shown to occur in two distinct mitral cell sets.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	350	 OX may provide for selective and dual actions in olfactory information processing, favoring mitral cells involved in the food-odor processing and silencing others that are not involved.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	351	 This duality of action could result in increasing signal to noise ratio and may increase olfactory detection power.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	352	 This hypothesis fully agrees with behavioral experiments, which are in progress by our research team.
0.14533791.15976062.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Indeed, preliminary results indicate that olfactory detection thresholds of rats are enhanced by OXA intracerebral injection.

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Ghrelin is a newly discovered peptide that is released from the stomach and from neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and potently stimulates growth hormone release and food intake.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) neurons in the ARC play an important role in the stimulation of food intake.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The present study aimed to determine whether ghrelin directly activates NPY neurons and, if so, to explore its signaling mechanisms.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Whether the neurons that respond to ghrelin could be regulated by orexin and leptin was also examined.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We isolated single neurons from the ARC of rats and measured the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2 fluorescence imaging.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Ghrelin (10-12 to 10-8 mol/l) concentration-dependently increased [Ca2+]i, which occurred in 35% of the ARC neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Approximately 80% of these ghrelin-responsive neurons were proved to be NPY-containing by immunocytochemical staining, and 58% of them were glucose-sensitive neurons as judged by their responses to lowering glucose concentrations.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The [Ca2+]i responses to ghrelin were markedly attenuated by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) but not protein kinase C and by a blocker of N-type but not L-type Ca2+ channels.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Orexin increased [Ca2+]i and leptin attenuated ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increases in the majority (80%) of ghrelin-responsive NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to induce Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	13	Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptor (GHSR), is synthesized abundantly in the stomach and to a much lesser extent in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) (1).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Peripheral or intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ghrelin releases growth hormone, stimulates food intake, and increases body weight in mice, rats, and humans (1 to 8).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	15	 ICV injection of antighrelin IgG suppresses starvation-induced feeding (3).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The daily pattern of plasma ghrelin levels in normal humans is characterized by a preprandial rise and postprandial fall (9).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These findings have suggested that ghrelin plays a physiological role in the meal initiation.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	18	The neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-containing neurons localized in the ARC have been implicated in the stimulation of food intake injection of NPY into the hypothalamus of rats potently stimulates food intake (10), and NPY secretion in the hypothalamus is increased during fasting (11).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Regarding a possible link between ghrelin and the NPY neurons in the ARC, it has been shown that GHSR mRNA is expressed in 94% of the NPY neurons in the ARC by double-labeling in situ hybridization histochemistry (12).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Systemic or ICV administration of ghrelin causes the ARC neurons to express Fos and Egr-1 (3,13 to 15) and 90% of these Fos-positive neurons express NPY mRNA (13).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Moreover, ghrelin increases the expression of NPY mRNA (3 to 5), and ICV administration of a NPY Y1 antagonist suppresses the ghrelin-stimulated food intake (3 to 5,15).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These findings suggest that the NPY neurons in the ARC could be an important effector for the orexigenic action of ghrelin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	23	The second messenger systems for GHSR have not been fully elucidated.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Signaling pathways for artificial GHS that act through GHSR in pituitary cells have been investigated.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	25	 GHRP-2 (a GHS) increases intracellular cAMP levels in ovine but not rat pituitary somatotropes (16,17).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	26	 GHRP-6 stimulates GH release from rat pituitary cells by activating protein kinase C (PKC) (17,18).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, the post-GHSR pathway could involve Gs and/or Gq proteins.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, the intracellular signaling for ghrelin s orexigenic action in the effector neurons is not well understood.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to examine whether ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC and, if so, to explore the signal transduction mechanisms, with special attention toward Ca2+ signaling.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	30	Leptin is an adipocyte-derived, potent anorexic peptide.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The leptin receptor is present in NPY neurons of the ARC, and leptin exerts its anorexic effect partly through suppression of NPY neurons (19).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Coinjection of leptin decreases the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on feeding in free fed rats (3).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Orexin-A and -B are orexigenic peptides produced in cell bodies located in the lateral hypothalamus (20).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The orexin-1 receptor is localized in the NPY-containing neurons in the ARC (21) and orexin-induced feeding is inhibited by NPY Y1 and/or Y5 receptor antagonists (22 to 24), suggesting that orexin could elicit feeding via these NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Therefore, the second aim of the present study was to examine whether a subset of the NPY neurons in the ARC could serve as the common target for ghrelin, leptin, and orexins.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	36	We found that ghrelin increases [Ca2+]i in 80% of NPY neurons via mechanisms involving protein kinase A (PKA) and N-type Ca2+ channels, and that the majority of the ghrelin-activated NPY neurons are also regulated by orexin-A and leptin.

0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	186	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   This study presents novel findings on the neuronal signaling mechanisms for the orexigenic action of ghrelin in the hypothalamus.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	187	 First, we demonstrated that ghrelin concentration-dependently increases [Ca2+]i in the NPY-containing neurons and the glucose-sensitive neurons of the ARC.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The [Ca2+]i increase often results from depolarization of the plasma membrane and is the key signal for triggering the release of neurotransmitters/hormones and gene expression (27,28).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Therefore, the [Ca2+]i increase is a good indicator of neuronal activation.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that ghrelin directly activates NPY neurons and glucose-sensitive neurons in the ARC, the neuronal systems implicated in the stimulation of feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We previously showed that the majority of the glucose-sensitive neurons in the ARC were NPY neurons (25).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Second, the ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increase depends on the Ca2+ influx through N-type Ca2+ channels and the cAMP-PKA pathway.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Third, the target neurons for ghrelin in the ARC extensively overlap with those for orexin and those for leptin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	194	It has been reported that the concentration of leptin in the cerebrospinal fluid, measured by radioimmunoassay, is 1.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	195	6 x 10-11 mol/l and that of orexin is 8 x 10-11 mol/l (29).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Although the concentration of ghrelin in the cerebrospinal fluid is not available, if ghrelin is transported through the blood-brain barrier at the rate similar to other peptides including leptin (30), the estimated ghrelin concentration in the brain is 10-12 mol/l.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These values may reflect the physiological concentrations of these peptides in the brain.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The concentration of ghrelin, leptin, and orexin used in the present study (10-10 mol/l) is close to these values and therefore the effects observed could be physiological.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	199	It was previously shown that GHSR, the ghrelin receptor, was abundant in NPY neurons of the ARC (12) and that the ghrelin-induced food intake was inhibited by an antagonist of the NPY Y1 receptor (3 to 5,15).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These reports suggested an involvement of NPY neurons in the ghrelin signaling pathway and the orexigenic effect.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The present study clearly demonstrated that ghrelin directly activates a substantial population (35%) of the ARC neurons and that as high as 80% of these ghrelin-responsive neurons are NPY-containing neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	202	In the pharmacological experiments to study signaling mechanisms for ghrelin, immunocytochemical identification of NPY neurons following [Ca2+]i measurements was carried out only in experiments with H89 and -conotoxin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	203	 However, because we examined 7 to 17 ghrelin-responsive neurons for each pharmacological experiment and the major population ( > 80%) of the ghrelin-responsive neurons was proved to be NPY-containing (Fig.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	204	 1), the result obtained may largely, if not solely, reflect that of NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increases were inhibited under a Ca2+-free condition and by a blocker of N-type Ca2+ channels, while it was slightly suppressed, if at all, by a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the Ca2+ pump in ER and consequently the Ca2+ release from ER, had no effect on ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increases.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The results with N-type Ca2+ channel blocker were obtained mainly from immunocytochemically identified NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These data indicate that ghrelin increases [Ca2+]i mainly via Ca2+ influx through N-type Ca2+ channels.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It has been shown that N-type Ca2+ channels are involved in the release of NPY stimulated by high potassium (31).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It was reported that the NPY Y2 receptor in NPY neurons is linked to a decrease of Ca2+ currents due to inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels (32).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Thus, N-type Ca2+ channels could play a pivotal role in the regulation of Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i in NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	212	The second messenger systems for ghrelin in the NPY neurons have not been adequately elucidated.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In the present study, an adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and a PKC activator TPA increased [Ca2+]i, indicating that both cAMP-PKA and PKC pathways are capable of activating Ca2+ signaling.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Furthermore, a specific PKA inhibitor, H89, but not a nonspecific inhibitor, H85, and PKC inhibitors significantly suppressed the ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increase.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The results with the PKA inhibitor were obtained mainly from immunocytochemically identified NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These results reveal that PKA is required for ghrelin to activate Ca2+ signaling in the NPY neurons of the ARC.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	217	 There are two possible explanations for the role of PKA.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	218	 First, the basal activity of PKA may be required for ghrelin to produce Ca2+ signaling.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Second, the ghrelin-GHSR system may activate the Gs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA cascade, which in turn leads to the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The PKA-mediated facilitation of the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i increase have been indicated in the cardiac muscle and in pancreatic ss-cells (28,33).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	221	 It has been shown that PKA is indispensable for CREB phosphorylation and cAMP response element-mediated gene expression in the NPY neurons in the fasted state (34).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Ghrelin could couple fasting to the activation of PKA because the release of this peptide is greatly stimulated by fasting (9).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These findings in the present study and by others indicate that PKA is important for the ghrelin-induced activation of NPY neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Whether the ghrelin-induced Ca2+ signaling in NPY neurons depends on the basal PKA activity or requires activation of PKA by this peptide remains to be clarified.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	225	In the present study, ghrelin and orexin increased [Ca2+]i in the same neurons of the ARC.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The majority of the ghrelin-responsive neurons (80%) also responded to orexin, and vise versa (86%), showing that the two populations of responders highly overlapped.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The ghrelin- and orexin-responsive neurons included eight NPY-containing neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The orexin-1 receptor is reportedly expressed on  > 90% of NPY neurons (35).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a subset of NPY neurons that serves as the common target for ghrelin and orexin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	230	 It has been shown that fasting and lowering glucose concentrations increase the level of ghrelin (9) and activate orexin neurons (26,36), suggesting that the release of the two peptides are regulated in parallel.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our finding indicates that ghrelin and orexin may also cooperate at their common effector site, the NPY neurons in the ARC, which could result in an efficient stimulation of the NPY-mediated neural signaling and feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	232	We found that leptin suppresses the ghrelin-induced [Ca2+]i increase in the majority of the ghrelin-responsive neurons (79%).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The ghrelin- and leptin-responsive neurons included seven NPY-containing neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Thus, the NPY neurons in the ARC are regulated reciprocally by ghrelin and leptin.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This is in accord with the report that 57% of the Fos-positive cells in the ventromedial ARC due to intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin were also immunoreactive for the leptin receptor (37).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The recently reported action of leptin to antagonize cAMP elevation (38 to 40) is a possible mechanism by which leptin counteracts the effect of ghrelin that is dependent on cAMP-PKA as demonstrated in the present study.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The action of leptin could also involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (38 to 41).
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Furthermore, we found that the orexin-induced [Ca2+]i increase in NPY neurons of the ARC is inhibited by leptin (T.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Thus, NPY neurons are regulated directly and cooperatively by ghrelin, orexin, and leptin, the important regulators of feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	240	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ghrelin directly interacts with NPY neurons in the ARC to elicit Ca2+ signaling via PKA and N-type Ca2+ channel-dependent mechanisms.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This could serve as the major neuronal signaling mechanism by which ghrelin stimulates NPY release and thereby feeding.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The ghrelin-responsive neurons are highly overlapped with orexin- and leptin-responsive neurons.
0.11980948.12663466.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The integration of stimulatory effects of ghrelin and orexin and inhibitory effect of leptin may play an important role in the regulation of the activity of NPY neurons and thereby feeding.

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Glucocorticoids play a key role to promote positive energy balance in normal and pathological conditions, at least in part, by altering the sensitivity to hypothalamic peptides.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The hyperphagia after central neuropeptide Y administration, for example, is attenuated by ADX, and there is evidence that glucocorticoids influence both MCH and orexin A activity.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In the present study, feeding responses to third ventricular MCH and orexin A were measured in rats after bilateral ADX or sham surgery.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	9	 ADX rats were significantly less sensitive to the orexigenic action of third ventricular MCH, whereas orexin A-induced hyperphagia was unaffected.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Replacement of corticosterone in the drinking water of ADX rats reversed the effects of ADX on MCH sensitivity.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Although we found significant populations of glucocorticoid receptors in the lateral hypothalamus, none were colocalized with either MCH or orexin A-containing cell bodies.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, whereas ADX significantly reduced hypothalamic MCH and orexin gene expression, this could not be restored by glucocorticoids in the drinking water.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Collectively, the present data suggest that glucocorticoids may promote food intake in part by potentiating the orexigenic actions of MCH without affecting the actions of orexin A and that glucocorticoids act indirectly to influence the effects of MCH on food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	14	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   OBESITY IS A MAJOR risk factor for many diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers (1).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Among the myriad factors mediating the regulation of food intake and body weight is the glucocorticoid, cortisol (corticosterone in rats) that is secreted from the adrenal cortex.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Glucocorticoids are lipophilic molecules that freely cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system, including those nuclei in the hypothalamus that are critical for energy balance regulation (2).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Glucocorticoids have long-term effects on food intake and obesity (3), and in rodents, most forms of genetic obesity are associated with increased glucocorticoid levels, whereas a lack of glucocorticoids is linked to hypophagia and reduced body weight (4).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The central infusion of glucocorticoids also leads to an increase in food intake and body weight (5).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In humans, a change in glucocorticoid status can also alter body weight.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	20	 For example, individuals with Addison s disease exhibit anorexia and weight loss due to adrenal insufficiency, whereas patients with Cushing s disease and other glucocorticoid excess syndromes have increased food intake and visceral adiposity (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In rodents, adrenalectomy (ADX) reverses many forms of obesity, whereas glucocorticoid replacement restores the obese state (4, 6) and glucocorticoid administration to adrenal-intact animals increases food intake and weight gain (4, 7).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	22	In addition to their important metabolic effects in the periphery, glucocorticoids act in several hypothalamic nuclei associated with the control of energy balance.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Several studies have elucidated the actions of glucocorticoids on activity of both the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei (ARC) (8).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Less explored is whether glucocorticoids also act upon neuropeptide systems within the lateral hypothalamus (LH).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Because it has long been known that activity of the LH is associated with increased food intake and weight gain, one reasonable hypothesis about the powerful effects of glucocorticoids to stimulate positive energy balance is that they act in part by stimulating the neuropeptide systems within the LH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	26	The first of these neuropeptide systems in the LH is melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a 19-amino acid polypeptide originally isolated from salmon pituitaries (9).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Neuroanatomical studies in rats demonstrate that MCH gene expression is limited to the LH and the zona incerta with extensive fiber projections throughout the brain (10).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	28	 MCH is produced from prepro-MCH along with two other putative peptides, neuropeptides EI and GE (11).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The only known MCH receptor in rats is SLC-1, a G-coupled protein receptor present throughout the brain and periphery (12, 13).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Central MCH is involved in many different physiological functions including reproduction, stress, activity, and importantly energy balance (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Food restriction increases MCH expression, and central injection of MCH promotes feeding (15).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In addition, MCH-deficient mice have reduced body weight and are lean due to hypophagia and an increase in metabolic rate (16).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The central administration of MCH also elicits an increase of water intake that is independent of food intake (17).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	34	The second peptide system contained in the LH is the orexins (also known as hypocretins), which originate from prepro-orexin (prepro-hypocretin) (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Orexin influences a variety of endocrine, autonomic, and metabolic functions, including the control of food intake, wakefulness, motor activity, metabolic rate, and blood pressure (19).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Orexin A is a 33-amino acid peptide that increases food intake and body weight in a dose-dependent manner when injected into the brain (20).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Conversely, administration of an orexin receptor antibody reduces food intake in fasted rats (21).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Similar to MCH, fasting up-regulates orexin mRNA expression (22).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Orexin-containing neurons project widely through the central nervous system and to hypothalamic nuclei important for the control of feeding where orexin receptors are located such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN), LH, ARC, and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (reviewed in Ref.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	40	Given the profound effects of glucocorticoids on feeding and orexigenic hypothalamic peptides, the goal of the present study was to assess the potential role of glucocorticoids to influence the effects of MCH and orexin A on food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids promote the actions of the peptides in the lateral hypothalamus as part of the complex hypothalamic system that regulates energy balance.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	42	 As a result, the present study first investigated the effects of third ventricular (i3vt) administration of MCH and orexin A on food intake in both ADX rats and sham-operated controls.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Next, we examined the influence of glucocorticoids on the expression of both MCH and orexin mRNA using semiquantitative PCR.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Because ADX causes a deficiency of circulating hormones in addition to glucocorticoids, we also examined whether or not glucocorticoid replacement could reverse any of the effects observed after ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Finally, we assessed the potential colocalization of MCH and orexin protein with glucocorticoid receptors within the LH to determine whether glucocorticoids may act directly on these neuronal populations.

0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	195	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The results of the present study suggest that the well-established orexigenic actions of MCH are influenced by glucocorticoid status, whereas orexin A, another lateral hypothalamic orexigenic peptide, is not.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	196	 More specifically, whereas ADX attenuated the orexigenic actions of MCH, the actions of orexin A were unaffected.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The effect of ADX on the sensitivity to MCH was reversed by corticosterone replacement, suggesting that this effect was specific to the glucocorticoid deficiency associated with ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	198	In addition to examining the effect of glucocorticoids on the hyperphagic actions of MCH and orexin A, we examined the actions of glucocorticoids to alter mRNA expression of MCH and orexin.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In accord with previous data, ADX reduced hypothalamic MCH mRNA, and orexin mRNA (28, 29).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, these reductions observed in both MCH and orexin were not restored by 5 d of corticosterone replacement in the drinking water despite this regimen achieving glucocorticoid levels comparable to those of sham-operated animals.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These data suggest that the gene expression changes in these lateral hypothalamic peptides are not glucocorticoid dependent but depend on nonglucocorticoid aspects of ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Previous reports described that MCH mRNA was increased above that of sham controls in ADX rats treated with dexamethasone (28).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Similarly, dexamethasone administration restored orexin mRNA after ADX (29).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Although it is commonly used, dexamethasone does not have the same binding properties as glucocorticoids (30), and it makes it much harder to assess whether physiological levels of glucocorticoid replacement are achieved.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Further work is necessary to address whether these methodological differences underlie the differences between the current data and reports from other groups.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that mineralocorticoids may have significant effects on the lateral hypothalamus.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This is particularly true in the case of MCH because we have reported that MCH has a potent and rapid effect to increase water intake even in the absence of available food (17), making it possible that the osmoregulatory aspects of mineralocorticoids may influence fluid ingestion via actions on MCH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	208	Glucocorticoid receptors are present in regions of the hypothalamus important for the regulation of food intake and body weight, including the ARC, PVN, and LH (27), suggesting that glucocorticoids may directly influence the activity or responsiveness of numerous neuropeptide systems regulating feeding.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Despite the fact that there is a large population of glucocorticoid receptor-positive cells within the LH, there is no evidence that any of them are located on either MCH- or orexin-containing neurons.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This is consistent with the data from the gene expression experiments, in which changes in both MCH and orexin expression appeared not to be tied to glucocorticoid action.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	211	Collectively, these data make several interesting points.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	212	 First, these data provide another dissociation between the MCH and orexin systems in the LH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Although both systems have cell bodies almost exclusively in the LH and act to regulate food intake, they appear to do so by separate neural circuits.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	214	 These data indicate that the actions of MCH to stimulate food intake are glucocorticoid dependent, whereas the actions of orexin-A are not.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In addition, MCH should now be added to the extensive list of regulatory peptides whose effects are altered by glucocorticoids.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Thus it appears that glucocorticoids have broad effects on a number of central nervous system circuits that have been linked to the control of food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	217	The present data also allow for some speculation about how glucocorticoids influence the actions of MCH to increase food intake.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	218	 MCH has projections to many brain regions important in the regulation of energy balance (10).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	219	 For example, SLC-1 (the first and only identified MCH receptor in rodents) mRNA and immunoreactivity have been observed in the ARC, PVN, LH, and VMN (13).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is possible, then, that glucocorticoids exert their effects on the MCH-food intake system by acting on the target cells for MCH.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	221	 For example, strong signals for both SLC-1 and GR have been observed in the PVN, making this a potential candidate for the site of action of glucocorticoids to reduce MCH s ability to increase food intake (13, 27).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	222	There are data indicating that the melanocortin system antagonizes the MCH system.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Consistent with this, MCH and -MSH exert opposing and antagonistic effects on food intake (31).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Other studies demonstrate that administration of either agouti-related protein (AgRP) or SHU9119 increases MCH mRNA but not orexin mRNA (32).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Because ADX increases melanocortin tone in some rodent models (33, 34), it is possible to speculate that this increase in melanocortin tone may antagonize the orexigenic effects of MCH, leading to the present effects of ADX on MCH, but not on orexin.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	226	Another possibility is that MCH exerts its effects via actions in the ARC to alter the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and/or AgRP.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Glucocorticoid receptors are found on these neurons (35) and the potent orexigenic effects of NPY and AgRP are blocked by glucocorticoid deficiency (34, 36).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Recent reports indicate that the ARC is a potent site for MCH to increase food intake and that in hypothalamic explants, the administration of MCH increases the release of NPY, suggesting that MCH may act through the activation of NPY neurons to affect feeding (37).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These data lead to the hypothesis that reduced action of MCH during glucocorticoid deficiency could be due to decreased actions of NPY and/or AgRP.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The reverse may also be true; that is, it has been proposed that NPY and/or AgRP exert their effects via recruiting MCH neurons in the LH (38).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Double-label immunohistochemistry demonstrates that MCH neurons receive innervation from NPY-immunoreactive fibers (39), and data also suggest that MCH neurons may express NPY receptors (40).
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Such evidence encourages the hypothesis that the effect of ADX to reduce the orexigenic actions of MCH may be responsible for the alteration of NPY actions after ADX.
0.11059638.15044362.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Future research should identify the glucocorticoid receptor populations that are responsible for the ability of glucocorticoids to dramatically alter the effects of a variety of neuropeptides such as MCH, NPY, -MSH, and AgRP.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Recent cDNA selections,2 genomic sequencing, and cosmid screenings have shown the existence of a large number of genes in the MHC, including a number that are expressed selectively in cells of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	10	2-8 In this review we discuss recent data that considerably expands the number of immune-related genes encoded in the MHC and review factors that may underlie its large scale organization.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	11	The MHC includes coding regions for the well-known and eponymous polymorphic surface antigens of the HLA class I and class II type that, respectively, present antigen to CD8 and CD4 T cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Intervening between the class II and the class I region of the human MHC is a class III region that includes genes for several of the components of the complement system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	13	9,10 Genes in the class II region have been found to encode components of the cytoplasmic proteasome that degrades proteins to peptides11 as well as peptide transporters for loading peptides onto class I proteins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	14	12 The class II region also encodes DM, a gene that facilitates loading and assembly of class II proteins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	15	13,14 Just centromeric to the class I region is a cluster of genes encoding three inflammation related proteins: tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), lymphotoxin (LTA), and lymphotoxin (LTB).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	16	15-18 Remarkably, the list of immune system-related genes and of chromosome segments potentially derived as duplications of parts of the MHC has grown substantially within the last year.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	17	The MHC is of major biomedical interest because of its contribution to transplant rejection and to variation between individuals in susceptibility to a variety of autoimmune disorders.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	18	19-23 In a number of cases it is clear that this susceptibility is determined by variation in the protein sequence of the class II molecules themselves.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, as will be discussed below, the possibility must still be entertained that polymorphism in other immune system-related genes of the MHC also contribute to these diseases.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	20	In addition to its role in influencing the propensity for known autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and rheumatoid arthritis (reviewed in Thomson, 199523 ), the MHC contains genes contributing to several other hereditary disorders that are either not autoimmune in nature or where the role of autoimmunity is uncertain.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These include ankylosing spondyloarthropathies, where there is a clear association with the class I allele HLA-B27, and narcolepsy, equally clearly associated with certain class II alleles.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The MHC also includes the genes for steroid 21-hydroxylase and hemochromatosis.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes the adrenogenital syndrome, and hemochromatosis is one of the most common simple Mendelian disorders of man.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Recently, a major quantitative trait locus for dyslexia was mapped to the distal MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This is actively being pursued by several groups.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	26	The MHC has been extensively studied and a large number of excellent reviews exist on a range of related topics.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	27	1,10,12,19,20,26-50 The present review will largely be restricted to the newest developments in recognition of the complexity of the role of the human MHC in the immuno-hematologic systems and the relationship among segments of the MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	28	    A SUBREGION OF THE MHC CONTAINS AN UNUSUAL CONCENTRATION OF GENES RELATED TO INFLAMMATION.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	29	By convention, the MHC is divided into three contiguous regions that approximate the location of genes with shared characteristics (Fig 1).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Most centromeric on chromosome 6p is the class II region, which contains the 17 known HLA class II genes and pseudogenes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	31	5 Contiguous to that is the class III region, which encodes several of the components of the complement system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Telomeric to the class III region is the class I region, which encodes more than 18 HLA class I-related genes and pseudogenes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Recently a number of genes putatively involved in inflammation have been identified in the central MHC, at the telomeric end of the class III region.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	34	 As presented below, this group of genes may have roles in various aspects of stress, inflammation, or infection.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We suggest that this concentration of genes is sufficiently distinct to be designated as the class IV region.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	46	 TNF has been very extensively studied47 and plays an important role in inflammation, bacterial,51 and viral infection,52 tumor cachexia, and the immune response.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	47	 It is produced by a variety of cells including prominently monocytes, macrophages, and some T-cell subsets.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In mice, variants in the TNF gene that affect the levels of TNF production are associated with variations in the level of susceptibility to renal disease in a lupus-like syndrome.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	49	53 Polymorphisms in the human TNF gene are associated with increased susceptibility to fatal cerebral malaria,54 rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,55 and perhaps other autoimmune disorders.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	50	LTA (also called TNF-) has actions that are very similar to those of TNF on a cellular basis but its pattern of expression is considerably more limited.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Remarkably, deletion of the LTA gene leads to a specific absence of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and splenic germinal centers in mice,60,61 whereas mice lacking TNF develop lymph nodes and Peyer's patches but lack splenic primary B-cell follicles.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	52	62 Deletion of the p55 TNF receptor results in normal lymph node development and architecture, normal migration of lymphocytes into the lamina propria and epithelium of the small intestine, but no organized Peyer's patches and absence of germinal centers.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	53	63 Based on these observations it is speculated that the effect of LTA on the development of lymphoid organs may be mediated by distinct receptors, some functioning in an organ-specific context.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	54	LTB (also called TNF C) is a membrane bound molecule that forms a heterotrimer with LTA.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	55	18 This LTA-LTB complex can then induce activation of NF B in certain cell lines by binding with the LTB receptor, a member of the TNF receptor family.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	56	64,65 NF B is a pleiotropic transcription factor capable of activating the expression of a great variety of genes critical for the immunoinflammatory response.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	57	65 The LTA-LTB complex is also weakly cytotoxic to some tumor cells but does not appear to induce apoptosis.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Within 15 kb upstream of the human TNF cluster is a gene designated B144 or LST-1 (leukocyte-specific transcript),66 a homologue of a partial cDNA first identified in the mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	59	67 The transcript of this gene is expressed exclusively in monocytes, macrophages, and some T cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Expression of the gene at the RNA level is increased by various activating stimuli, and in particular by -interferon (-IFN).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The most probable gene product is encoded in an open reading frame whose cognate amino acid sequence is over 50% identical between humans and mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The amino acid sequence contains a long hydrophobic region near the N terminus but otherwise shows no apparent relationship to proteins of known function.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The interpretation of the open reading frame and the regulation of this gene is complicated by the remarkable degree of alternative splicing that is seen in the mRNA products.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	64	The B144 RNA is actually an ensemble of related sequences derived from four alternative 5' exons and 3 internal exons as well as several forms of the 3' exon.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Exons 5 and 6 may be associated with any of the 5' exons and may be separately or jointly omitted from the final mRNA product.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The result is that 24 or more forms of mRNA may be seen in U937 monocyte cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Some of these forms could encode altered forms of the putative protein while others affect only the 5' untranslated region.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The gene is also peculiar in that one spliced form apparently has a GA dinucleotide as the first bases at the 5' end of an intron.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The first two bases of introns are generally GT with an occasional GC, so that the B144 splice site is highly unusual and perhaps unique.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The mouse gene also seems to have multiple alternative splice forms in cultured cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The amount of B144 mRNA in some cells is quite substantial and it would be surprising if the protein were not formed in significant amounts, although there are presently no publications characterizing the putative protein.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	72	 A second gene, 1C7, that is preferentially expressed in monocytes and certain other hematopoietic cell lines, lies immediately adjacent to B144,68 such that the 3' ends of the two mRNA templates come within a few bases of overlapping.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The gene encodes at least three differentially spliced mRNAs.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Each mRNA encodes a potential leader sequence and an internal membrane anchor segment, but the three forms differ in the length and sequence of the carboxy-terminal intracytoplasmic domain.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The encoded product has weak similarity to surface antigens such as CTLA4.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Recently another MHC-encoded monocyte and lymphocyte-specific cDNA, called AIF-1, was identified because of its elevated level of expression in experimental cardiac transplants.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	77	69-72 Separately the gene had been characterized and termed G1.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	78	73 The gene for this transcript lies shortly centromeric of B144.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	79	 It is highly conserved between rodents and humans.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The mRNA is upregulated by -interferon and is expressed by a subset of macrophages infiltrating allografts.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The putative amino acid translation lacks a hydrophobic leader sequence.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, it has strong homology to the EF hand protein motif found in calcium binding proteins involved in neutrophil activation74 and also in a myeloid chemoattractant protein.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	83	75 Not all cytokine genes encode leader sequences and it remains possible that the AIF-1 protein may be secreted or released from injured cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The function of this gene remains unknown.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In the same region of the MHC just telomeric to the TNF cluster is a gene for a protein that contains certain motifs similar to those seen in I B, called I B-Like (IkBL).
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	86	76 The role of I B in negative regulation of NF B and hence the inflammatory response is a well-known paradigm in transcriptional control, involving regulation both by phosphorylation and by ubiquitination and protein degradation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	87	 By analogy the MHC-encoded IkBL molecule is a candidate for a regulator of inflammatory responses although it is described as being widely expressed.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Rather surprisingly, there are no functional data available for this molecule.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Centromeric of the Hsp70 genes43 lies SKI2W,77-79 a gene encoding a protein with substantial similarity to the yeast Ski2 (superkiller 2) protein,80 including its RNA helicase motifs.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Ski2 makes yeast cells resistant to killer toxin RNA viruses by virtue of its ability to block the translation of nonpolyadenylated or noncapped viral mRNAs targeted for degradation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	91	81,82 This gene plays a partially redundant but essential role in normal yeast growth83 and has an antiviral effect as well.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Because of the homologies with the yeast gene it remains possible that one role for the human gene is as a mediator of antiviral effects, particularly against RNA viruses that use nonpolyadenylated RNA during their life cycle.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The MIC (MHC class I related) family84,85 is a group of homologous genes and pseudogenes interspersed in the distal class III and class I region of the MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The structure of the genes and predicted coding products resemble that of class I genes but they are clearly a divergent family.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	95	 They are also characterized by very large first introns.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The only members of the group known to be expressed as mRNA are MIC-A and B, whose genes lie telomeric to the IkBL gene and centromeric to HLA-B.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The MIC-A protein is expressed and properly folded independently of 2-microglobulin and is preferentially expressed in the intestinal mucosa.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	98	86 Curiously, the transcription of MIC-A is upregulated by heat shock.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Thus, the gene shares properties with the class I genes per se but has at least one functional feature that would relate it to the heat shock genes located more centromerically.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	100	Overall then there are, in the central MHC between the complement region (class III) and the class I region, at least seven genes implicated to some degree in inflammatory responses.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	101	 There is also an eighth gene, 1C7, that has not yet been studied functionally but whose pattern of expression is consistent with a similar role.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In addition, the IkBL molecule near one end of this cluster is at least a potential candidate for a role in inflammation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The BAT1 gene (D6S81E ), also in this region, encodes an RNA helicase that conceivably could play a role in the complex splicing of B144 as well as other genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	104	87 At the centromeric end of this region are a number of genes of unknown function and broad expression, and also the genes for three heat shock proteins88 whose expression may be elevated in inflammation.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Heat shock proteins have also been implicated in mediating antiviral effects of prostaglandins.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	106	89 Overall we suggest that this segment of the MHC be given a separate designation as the class IV region with recognition of its multiple potential roles in inflammation and stress responses.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	107	    ADDITIONAL IMMUNE-RELATED GENES ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE ENTIRE MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	108	The genes mentioned in the above paragraphs and the cited reviews encode a substantial number of structurally remotely related or totally unrelated proteins that are expressed specifically within or function by interacting with cells of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Gene linkage as a consequence of duplication and divergence does not seem an adequate explanation for this clustering.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Ascertainment bias is a conceivable explanation because of the intensity with which the immune system and this gene cluster have been investigated.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This explanation seems progressively less likely as more immune-system genes of divergent structure are discovered within the cluster.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The recent finding in the distal MHC of an additional three or four genes of different families that are expressed selectively in immunocytes seems to make the coincidence argument almost untenable.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Further, these genes are of unknown function and, as of yet, of an unknown degree of polymorphism, so their potential contribution to association of MHC haplotypes with propensity for autoimmune disorders is of some interest.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The recently detected immune system genes of the distal MHC include the following.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid peptide whose sequence is remarkably conserved among eukaryotes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	116	 It is expressed in almost all cells of the body and its generic function is to become attached to other proteins and target their degradation by the proteasome system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Ubiquitin plays a role in a diverse variety of cellular processes including chromatin structure, cell-cycle control, modification of cell receptors, DNA repair processes, gene silencing, and the activation and degradation of NF B.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	118	90 However, it is curious that ubiquitin was initially studied as a peptide that might have transcellular effects in modulating the activity of immunocytes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	119	Several genes encoding ubiquitin homologues have been discovered including at least two non-MHC genes that are implicated in the function of the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	120	 One of these, ISG15,91-94 encodes a protein homologous to a ubiquitin dimer that is not expressed in unstimulated cells, but is induced by - or -IFN in a variety of cell types.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	121	 After interferon treatment newly synthesized ISG15 is found intracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Pulse-chase experiments show that after 24 hours, more than 50% of labeled ISG15 is found extracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The question of whether this protein has a transcellular effect in vivo remains unaddressed.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	124	The primary product of the ISG15 gene contains an extension of eight amino acids beyond the C terminal diglycine that is characteristic of ubiquitin.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	125	96 This C terminal extension is rapidly removed intracellularly.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The primary translation product has no demonstrated effect on cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In contrast the processed product is active at the low nanogram per milliliter level in inducing -IFN production by T cells.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Isolation and sequencing of the protein, known as MNSF (monoclonal nonspecific suppressor factor), followed by cloning of its cDNA showed that this protein was a ubiquitin homologue despite its apparent larger molecular weight when isolated from cells.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	132	The distal MHC encodes a molecule, known as FAT10, that is homologous to ubiquitin but as divergent from ISG15 or MNSF as either of the two are from ubiquitin.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The homology to ubiquitin extends to preservation of the C terminal diglycine that appears necessary for transfer of ubiquitin to other molecules as well as the internal lysines and flanking sequence on which ubiquitinylation occurs.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The molecule is strongly expressed at the RNA level by some B-lymphoblastoid lines and -IFN inducible in others.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Among other things these observations raise the interesting possibility that additional immune system genes will be located in the paralogous regions on chromosomes 1 and 9, and perhaps 19 where the class I-like zinc-2-glycoprotein gene is located.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	324	As discussed above, both class II and class I genes show extensive allelic variability due to point mutations, intra-locus recombinations, and intra-locus gene conversion-like events.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	325	 In addition, the relationship between class I regions of various mammals is complex and multiple cycles of expansion and contraction must have occurred to account for the genetic structure of the region and its inter- and intra-species differences.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	328	One striking feature of the divergence between the murine and human class I regions is that it has resulted in the presence of functional subfamilies of class I genes in each species that are missing from the other.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	333	 As described above, humans also have a family of five genes or pseudogenes termed MIC85 or PERB168 genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	334	 These encode at least one expressed product, MIC-A protein, which is polymorphic, induced by heat shock and expressed preferentially in intestinal mucosa, but its precise function is not yet known.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Comparable products were undetectable in the mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	336	The MIC genes are clearly structurally related to class I genes both in terms of the structure of the proteins they encode and in the position of seven introns located at homologous positions in the coding sequences.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	337	 The structure of the MIC genes differs from those of other class I genes in that they contain a long (about 10 kb) first intron.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	338	 This intron contains the first exon of a transcript derived from the complementary strand.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	341	The mouse MHC complex apparently lacks any genes of the MIC series, and the human lacks the extensive series of TL genes of the mouse.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	342	2 and MOG suggests that either the entire region of the human MHC from HLA-A to HLA-F is compressed to less than 150 kb in the mouse and contains a single H2M class I gene,169 or that an inversion has occurred with one end point lying between B30.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	343	 This is further evidence of the remarkably extensive rearrangements, deletions, and expansions that have occurred in the vertebrate MHC class I region.

0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	346	 The exact duplication region has not been defined yet, but it apparently lacks the olfactory receptor genes that are located between the nearest class I gene and the proximal histone gene cluster.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	347	As indicated in the above paragraphs, the MHC exhibits several singular characteristics, including a clustering of genes of disparate structure that function within the immuno-hematopoietic system, evidence of rapid evolution relative to most of the nonrepetitive sequence portions of the genome, and evidence for variation in the rates of intra-MHC recombination.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	348	 We speculate that these phenomena may be related in the following way.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Class I and class II genes of the MHC, in particular, appear to be subject to selective pressures for diversification that operate on a short time scale relative to most evolutionary events.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Environmental stresses may also put selective pressure on alleles of other immune system genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	351	 In addition, the resulting rapid shifts in allele abundance and composition of the class I and class II genes, whether due to parasite-driven selection or to effects of the MHC on procreation, may result in the emergence of autoimmune phenomena putting secondary selective pressure on other genes of the immune system to diminish the incidence or consequences of autoimmunity.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Also, the extreme divergence of class I regions of mammals compared with even the class II region raises the question of whether there are other evolutionary pressures on class I genes beyond those arising from the presentation of peptides to the T-cell receptor.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	353	The presence of other immune system genes in the same chromosomal region and therefore in linkage disequilibrium with the classical MHC genes provides the opportunity for simultaneous selection of the optimal alleles of these other genes from among the variety of chromosomes carrying the newly selected class I or II allele.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	354	 This diminishes the rate of disruption of the favored combinations of alleles that would result from recombination or reassortment of chromosomes in meiosis.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	355	 If recombination rates were the same in all MHCs then there would be an optimal low rate of recombination sufficient to generate favorable combinations of alleles but low enough to limit the genetic burden of recombinant nonoptimal chromosomal segments.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	356	171 However, different MHC regions exhibit heterogeneous rates of recombination, controlled at least in part by sequences within the MHC itself.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	357	 This permits recombination of alleles so as to generate, among others, favorable combinations in chromosomal segments that may then be relatively locked in by recombination suppression.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	358	 These chromosomal segments would be advantageous and thus expanded, generating extended haplotypes that show linkage disequilibrium in the population.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The same considerations could apply to the occurrence of olfactory receptor genes linked to the MHC.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	360	 If class I genes in particular are determinants of odor, as reviewed above, then there might be coselection of receptors that are responsive (or nonresponsive) to the class I-determined odors.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	361	The MHC has long been known to play a major role in the determination of genetic susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, and a large part of this is due to polymorphisms in the class II genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	362	 However, there are at least some cases where the evidence is strong that non-class II genes of the MHC also play a role in the predisposition to autoimmunity.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	363	 The identification of additional genes in this region that modify the propensity for autoimmune diseases could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	364	 In recent years analyses of MHC encoded transcripts has shown that there are within the MHC more than 10 different structurally diverse families of genes whose patterns of expression indicate a specific role in the immune system.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	365	 The number of different MHC genes functioning in the immune response and the extensive regions of linkage disequilibrium seen in some instances in the MHC make it particularly difficult to use positional genetic approaches to assign disease contributions to particular gene products.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Short of understanding the regulation and function of each protein at a level such that the effect of amino acid or nucleotide sequence variations could be predicted, perhaps the best genetic approach is to look for sense changes in codons or variation in known promoter elements for each gene, and then test in large populations to see if there is any correlation with disease manifestations independent of their disequilibrium with the class II genes.
0.09784351.9373235.html.plaintext.txt	367	 This could be very difficult for a number of reasons, not least of which is the extensive degree of linkage disequilibrium and the consequent occurrence of extended haplotypes in this region.

0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	4	In a novel and important set of clinical studies reported in this issue of JCEM, Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	5	 (1) examined long- and short-sleepers, who sleep greater than 9 h or less than 6 h per night, respectively.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Assessing melatonin and cortisol levels and monitoring body temperature, they found a longer "biological night" in long-sleepers than in short-sleepers, which is characterized by a greater duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion and later early morning temperature nadirs and cortisol peaks (1).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus, physiological processes that mark the output of the circadian timing system parallel sleep duration.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	8	The findings of Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	9	 (1) give credence to everyday observations that sleep needs vary individually and suggest that the amount of sleep we need reflects intrinsic factors.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These observations also underlie why it is difficult to change sleep patterns, if we are fighting inherent physiology.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	11	The notion that one s sleep duration is intrinsically determined has widespread implications in many disciplines, including industry, healthcare, and education.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	12	 "Sleep debt" caused by sleep deprivation is a recognized cause of industrial accidents and impaired worker productivity (2).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	13	 For example, roadway accidents are more common in sleep-deprived truck drivers (3).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The productivity of air traffic controllers is adversely affected by shift work, as well (4).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	15	The excessive work hours of medical house officers, who work through the night when "on-call," has raised concern about patient safety.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Understandably, this issue has caught the scrutiny of legislators and regulatory agencies (5).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These efforts have resulted in new policies that limit work hours by medical staff.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	18	Not only are we curtailing the sleep of adults in the name of productivity, the educational system is cutting into the sleep of children and adolescents.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In many educational districts, the school day begins in early morning hours (6).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It is not uncommon to see children standing on street corners awaiting the school buses in early morning darkness.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Reflecting the fact that it is difficult to advance the hands on one s biological clock irrespective of age, adverse effects from reduced sleep and early morning awakening on academic performance are being increasingly recognized in children and adolescents (6).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	22	We live in a society in which we can control our photic environment through the simple flip of a switch or the more convenient clap of the hands.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Using alarm clocks and planned schedules, we believe that we can override our natural sleep needs.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We believe that we can comfortably live our lives out of synchrony with the 24-h light-dark cycle, and reverse our days and nights without penalty.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, as reflected by the ever-increasing number of businesses devoted to optimizing schedules of shift workers, it is difficult to willfully change sleep habits and the hands of the circadian clock.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	26	It was thought that by exposing shift workers to bright light at night, the circadian clock could be reset.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Yet, unless stringent efforts are made to limit daytime lighting exposure, resetting of the biological clock will not occur, and melatonin and cortisol rhythms may remain out of phase with periods of sleep and wakefulness (7).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Individuals working at night may, thus, be out of phase with their optimal periods of alertness and task performance.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Efforts to develop agents to reset the circadian clock (i.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	30	 "jet lag drugs") have also been largely unrealized (8).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Despite the popular hype that melatonin can conveniently shift circadian phase, data to support this notion are not striking and show modest effects at best (9, 10).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	32	Just as it is difficult to change one s circadian phase, the observations of Aeschbach et al.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	33	 (1) provide a basis for why it is difficult to change sleep habits.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Because the duration of the biological night varies individually, it may be more difficult for some individuals to adapt to condensed sleep schedules than others.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Strategies and guidelines aimed at improving health and productivity of shift workers may, therefore, be effective for some individuals, but ineffective for others.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	36	The biological basis of variability in sleep duration is unknown at present and remains an intriguing issue.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	37	 An evolving body of evidence suggests that the sleep cycle and circadian rhythmicity are integrally related, with the circadian system influencing both the timing and duration of sleep.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Expressed circadian rhythms, like the sleep-wake cycle and rhythms in hormone production, are generated and regulated by a biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Damage to these nuclei results in episodes of sleep and wakefulness occurring throughout the 24-h day, rather than being consolidated at night.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	40	 SCN damage also results in an increase in the total duration of sleep in primates (12).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	41	Over the past decade, the dissection of the molecular hands of the circadian clock has lead to fascinating new insights.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The generation of circadian rhythms seems to be related to the complex interaction of a handful of transcriptional regulators and kinases, resulting in 24-h cycles of protein expression and action in the SCN (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In mammals these factors include the proteins PERIOD, CLOCK, CRY, BMAL, and casein kinase 1 (11).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Mutations in some of these factors have been discovered recently.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	45	In humans, mutations in PERIOD-2 are associated with the advanced circadian phase syndrome (13).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Individuals with this condition wake very early in the morning and retire to bed at early evening hours.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In animals, mutations in CLOCK result in abnormal, disorganized sleep problems (14).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Mutations in casein kinase 1 result in a short circadian day (period) (15).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	49	Whereas it is possible to localize the circadian clock in mammals to a discrete region in the brain, the brain regions involved in sleep organization are far more diffuse, involving complex subcortical networks (16).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Similar to how clock-gene mutations are providing insights into the biological basis of circadian rhythmicity, the discovery of novel proteins has also provided insights in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders (17, 18, 19).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The inability to produce or respond to orexin/hypocretin has been found to be a cause of narcolepsy (17), and it is likely that this seminal discovery will lead to new diagnostic tests and treatment for this disorder (17).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	52	By coupling our knowledge of basic clock and sleep mechanisms with powerful genetic approaches that permit the identification of specific genes in small cohorts, it is likely that there will be further identification and elucidation of factors that regulate the duration and timing of sleep (18).
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The continued characterization of individual variation in sleep and the identification of families and cohorts with unusual sleep and circadian properties will also greatly enhance genetic approaches in this regard.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, we may someday learn why some individuals have the ability to stay up and watch David Letterman after the 11 o clock news, whereas others retire before the news at 10 o clock.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	55	Society, industry, and medicine are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of sleep and the proper timing of sleep cycles, as reflected by sleep- and work-hour-related laws.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, compared with the advances in our understanding of basic sleep and circadian physiology and molecular biology, public attention in this arena has lagged considerably.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	57	 We can readily manipulate our photic environment, yet we stubbornly recognize how difficult it is to overcome "mother nature" and change the timing of and the amount of sleep we need.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Increasingly, we seem to value our alarm clocks more than our internal clocks.
0.23939125.12519822.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Thus, an important challenge of our modern and fluid society is to be able to accommodate our normal circadian cycle and our individual sleep requirements in the name of progress and productivity.

0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	0	Editorial I Central noradrenergic neurones and the mechanism of general anaesthesia K.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	1	Modern anaesthetics are, in the main, safe and predictable in their use, and highly efficient.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	2	 Moreover, it could be argued that without these properties major advances in surgical practice, so often highlighted in the media, could not have taken place.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	3	 However, as an example of pharmacology, the production of the anaesthetic state remains somewhat of a mystery.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This mystery results from the controversies related to the existence of a unitary anaesthetic target site.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	5	 From direct observation of clinical anaesthesia, this seems unlikely as different anaesthetic agents produce different  types  of anaesthesia.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	6	 GABAA receptors have long been held as a unifying cellular target (with some exceptions), but others have also been suggested.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this editorial, we consider the evidence in support of a role for noradrenergic transmission as a  wiring  target for anaesthetic action.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The clear role of this system in analgesia is not considered.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	9	Norepinephrine is a major central nervous system neurotransmitter in the brainstem.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Noradrenergic neurones are of great importance in the regulation of a range of behaviours including the sleep to wake cycle, feeding, thermoregulation, attention, motor activity, and growth and development.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	11	1 In addition, there are many studies suggesting that noradrenergic system(s) may be involved in the production of the  anaesthetic state .
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In the brain, the A1, A2, A5, and A7 noradrenergic clusters constituting the lateral tegmental area, project to the thalamus and hypothalamus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	13	2 The locus coeruleus (A6 cluster), which is distinct from the lateral tegmental area, innervates the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	14	The activity of locus coeruleus neurones is slow and regular during wakefulness.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	15	3 In contrast, when an animal becomes drowsy, entering slow wave and then REM sleep, there is a decrease in discharge rate such that during REM sleep these neurones are silent.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	16	3 Interestingly, all noradrenergic projections to the cerebrocortex originate from the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	17	The preoptic area receives input from both the locus coeruleus (A6), and the lateral tegmental group (A1, A2, A5, and A7) noradrenergic neurones.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	18	 4 In addition, neurones in the preoptic area project back to the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	19	5 This area plays an important role in sleep or hypnosis.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	20	 What is the role of noradrenergic neurones in this area? Most of the previous studies6 suggest that norepinephrine neurones in the preoptic area may contribute to wakefulness, as direct activation or injection of norepinephrine into this area inhibits sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, several studies also suggest that some norepinephrine neurones may be involved in the induction of sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	22	7 8 Mohan Kumar and colleagues7 reported that microinjection of norepinephrine into the medial preoptic area after destruction of the ventral noradrenergic bundle induced sleep.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This group also reported that there was a mild reduction in sleep and an increase in wakefulness after destruction of catecholaminergic terminals at the medial preoptic area by bilateral intracerebral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	24	8 Thus, it appears that noradrenergic fibres in the medial preoptic area may be hypnogenic.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	25	Central noradrenergic neurones are regulated by both - and ss-adrenergic receptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	26	 It has been reported that the 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, given orally, increased active waking and slow wave sleep and decreased paradoxical sleep in the rat.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	27	9 In contrast, 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with systemic methoxamine, increased aroused wakefulness and decreased slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep in cats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	28	10 In addition, prazosin increased but the 1-agonist ST 587 decreased the duration of thiopental anaesthesia in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	29	11 Matsumoto and colleagues also reported that direct intracerebroventricular administration of methoxamine dose-dependently reduced pentobarbital anaesthesia time in mice.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	30	12 Most of the central physiological effects of 2-agonists can be attributed to 2-adrenoceptors present in the locus coeruleus.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	31	13 In rats, microinjection of the 2-agonist dexmedetomedine into the locus coeruleus per se produces anaesthesia (defined as a loss of righting reflex).
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	32	14 2-Agonists also reduce anaesthetic requirement in human and many other species.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	33	15 In contrast to these data, the 2-antagonist yohimbine decreases sleep,16 and anaesthesia time15 in a variety of non-human species.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	34	The Angel group showed that propranolol, a non-selective ss-antagonist, dose-dependently increased sleep time16 and thiopental anaesthesia time11 in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, they failed to show an effect with the selective ss1-antagonists metoprolol and atenolol.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	36	11 17 They also studied the role of ss2-adrenoceptors in sleep and general anaesthesia,11 16 17 and found that the selective ss2-antagonist ICI 118551 increased sleep time16 and the duration of thiopental anaesthesia.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	37	17 Collectively, these data indicate that the effects of the non-selective antagonist, propranolol, may be mediated via ss2-adrenoceptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	38	The recently identified (from rat hypothalamus) neuropeptides orexin A and B18 are endogenous agonists for the G-protein-coupled orexin-1 (OX1) and OX2 receptors.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	39	18 Orexin A has equal affinity for OX1 and OX2, while orexin B has a higher affinity for OX2.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Orexins and their receptors are widely distributed in the brain.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	41	18 Orexins activate the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system and this activation may increase arousal and locomotor activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	42	19 In addition, several reports20 suggest a link between orexin receptors and narcolepsy.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Therefore, modulation of noradrenergic neurones by orexins and their receptors may contribute to control of the sleep to wake cycle.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Moreover, we suggest that these neuropeptides and their receptors may also be involved in general anaesthesia, although this remains to be examined.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	45	Based on these considerations, we and others have began a systematic evaluation of a range of anaesthetic agents on central norepinephrine release using in vivo microdialysis techniques.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Mizuno and colleagues reported that intraperitoneal pentobarbital inhibited norepinephrine release from the medial preoptic area in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	47	4 In addition, we have shown that systemic administration of midazolam and propofol significantly reduced norepinephrine release from the medial prefrontal cortex,21 but pentobarbital was ineffective.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	48	22 As noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex receive innervation from the locus coeruleus,3 the activity of noradrenergic neurones in the prefrontal cortex indirectly reflects locus coeruleus activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, anaesthetics that activate or enhance GABAA receptors may reduce noradrenergic neuronal activity.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In contrast, ketamine,21 22 nitrous oxide and xenon,23 which have NMDA receptor antagonistic actions, markedly increased norepinephrine release from the prefrontal cortex and preoptic area in rats.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Clearly, anaesthetic modulation of norepinephrine release depends on the type of anaesthetic.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This might argue against noradrenergic transmission as an anaesthetic target.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, as we have already mentioned, a unitary site is highly unlikely.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Loss of consciousness results not only from a reduction in cerebral activity, but also as a result of cerebral excitation such as occurs during convulsions.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In addition, sleepiness is induced by not only hypothermia but also by increased body temperature that activates heat-sensitive neurones in the preoptic area.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	56	24 We feel that wakefulness may occur over a set range and that when this range is exceeded (above or below), unconsciousness may occur.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In support of this hypothesis we found that physostigmine, which has been reported to antagonize ketamine anaesthesia, reduced both the duration of ketamine anaesthesia and ketamine-increased norepinephrine release from the rat prefrontal cortex.
0.18986537.11878678.html.plaintext.txt	58	Collectively, the data presented in this editorial provide compelling evidence in favour of a role for noradrenergic transmission in both the control of wakefulness and the production of the  mysterious  anaesthetic state.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Immunocytochemistry revealed HCRT-producing perikarya exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus-perifornical region and dorsomedial hypothalamus of the monkey brain.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	12	 HCRT axons and axon terminals were present in different parts of the hypothalamus and adjacent forebrain and thalamic nuclei.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The 24-h fast resulted in an approximately 50% decline in circulating leptin levels and significantly elevated c-fos expression in the perifornical region; in the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and arcuate nuclei; and in the medial preoptic area.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In the dorsomedial nucleus and perifornical region of fasted monkeys, three times more HCRT-neurons expressed nuclear c-fos than those of the normally fed controls.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Neurons in different parts of the hypothalamus and basal forebrain that expressed c-fos, but did not contain HCRT, were targets of HCRT-immunopositive boutons establishing asymmetric synapses.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In the arcuate nucleus, subsets of these HCRT-targeted c-fos-expressing cells contained neuropeptide Y.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The fact that these lateral hypothalamic cells have leptin receptors and can be activated by a metabolic challenge and that they innervate diverse brain regions indicates that the HCRT system may be a key integrator of environmental cues in their regulation of diverse brain activity.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	23	 HCRT cells of rats and monkeys were found to express leptin receptor immunoreactivity and to provide synaptic input to distinct hypothalamic and brainstem circuits known to participate in the central regulation of endocrine, metabolic, and autonomic systems (4, 7).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although the determination of synaptic interactions between HCRT and other hypothalamic systems provided the map via which signals may travel within the hypothalamus, that does not demonstrate whether that signaling modality is involved in homeostatic regulation.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For that determination, the cytochemical identification of c-fos as an indicator of cell activity under different metabolic conditions may be used.

0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	121	The present study provides the first suggestive evidence that the HCRT system of nonhuman primates is involved in the hypothalamic signal transduction associated with metabolic alterations.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The fact that short-term food withdrawal underlies robust activation of transcriptional mechanisms in the primate lateral hypothalamic HCRT system, together with the widespread distribution of HCRT projections in homeostatic centers and beyond, argues for a coordinating role for HCRT in autonomic, endocrine, and metabolic processes.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This assertion is in line with evidence that is available for the role of HCRT in the modulation of food intake, blood pressure, and arousal (3, 5, 6, 11, 12).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	124	In a previous study (4), the monkey ARC was found to receive a robust HCRT innervation, with HCRT axons heavily innervating NPY cells (4).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Whether this ARC NPY system may participate in the modulation of HCRT on food intake in primates, as suggested in the rat (13, 14), remains to be tested.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The present observation of HCRT input to fasting-activated NPY cells in the African green monkey lends support to this possibility.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that the activation of HCRT neurons by fasting occurs secondary to the activation of the ARC.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, ARC NPY cells are most likely protected by the blood-brain barrier, and the direct projection from the ARC to the lateral hypothalamus is not robust in the nonhuman primate (4).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	129	 It may also be plausible that, because of the HCRT system is heavily involved with the regulation of sleep/wake cycles, it is disturbance of sleep during fasting that affects HCRT neuronal function.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Alternatively, should metabolic signals affect HCRT cells during fasting, sleep disturbances may be the consequence HCRT neuronal activation.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	131	Leptin receptor immunoreactivity has been detected in the primate lateral hypothalamic HCRT cells (4), and leptin is suggested to cross the blood-brain barrier (15).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Thus, the observed induction of c-fos gene expression in the HCRT cells may be a direct consequence of the diminishing leptin levels we observed after the short-term fasting.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, fasting paradigms, particularly when used on primates, do not allow for the distinction of the effect of particular hormones, because they underlie complex responses of a variety of endocrine mechanisms.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	134	 For example, in the rodent, evidence is available to indicate that circulating insulin and/or glucose levels have a regulatory influence on hypothalamic HCRT expression (16).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Future studies will determine the extent of contribution of each of the involved humoral and metabolic signals in the activation of primate HCRT systems.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	136	Interestingly, in the hypothalamic nuclei (including the ARC, LH-PF, dorsomedial nucleus, and MPOA), in which short-term fasting induced c-fos expression the most robustly, activated cells received multiple HCRT inputs.
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In rodents, HCRT exerts excitatory postsynaptic currents (17), and intracerebroventricular administration of HCRT induces c-fos expression in a manner not dissimilar to what we describe here in the nonhuman primate (18, 19).
0.32579625.12933647.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Because all the synaptic membrane specializations between HCRT axons and c-fos-expressing perikarya in the primate hypothalamus were asymmetrical, stimulatory synapses, the activation of hypothalamic circuitry by metabolic challenge may be mediated, in part, by the HCRT system.

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Testosterone and estrogen replacement in males and females, respectively, restored the response of MCH neurons to glucose.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The demonstrated sex differences in the response of MCH neurons to glucose correlated well with the gonadal steroid milieu; thus, MCH neurons may play an important role in sex differences in feeding behavior.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	15	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   SEX DIFFERENCES IN feeding behavior have long been recognized in many species.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For example, analyses of spontaneous patterns of feeding have shown that the size of a single meal is smaller in females than in males, and the total volume of daily food intake is also smaller in females than in males (1, 2).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, the size of a single meal varies during the estrous cycle, decreasing around the time of ovulation in females, including humans (1, 3, 4).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although these sex differences are attributable to gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone and/or estrogen (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), the neural mechanism is still unclear.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	19	 For example, although cholecystokinin has been reported to be involved in estrogen-induced decrease in food intake (10), there is still controversy about whether cholecystokinin mediates estrogen-induced anorexia (11, 12).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It is also not known whether cholecystokinin mediates testosterone-induced hyperphagia.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recent studies have identified distinct neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons (13) that generate hunger (14, 15).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (16), is another neuropeptide that prominently induces feeding (17, 18).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The hypothalamic circuit between the LHA and the arcuate nucleus is thus an important component of the central system controlling feeding behavior (19).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In this circuit, judging from studies that genetically disrupted the orexigenic neuropeptides, MCH neurons in the LHA play a key role.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mice lacking the gene encoding MCH are lean (20), whereas mice overexpressing the MCH gene are susceptible to obesity (21).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	26	 It has also been suggested that MCH neurons are involved in the glucosensing system, because hypothalamic MCH mRNA levels are increased by hypoglycemic conditions such as fasting, insulin injection, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment (14, 22, 23).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In contrast to MCH, mice lacking the gene encoding prepro-orexin or NPY display normal growth (24, 25, 26).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	28	It is probable that sex differences in feeding behavior are at least in part attributable to sex differences in the neurons involved in feeding behavior.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because MCH neurons in the LHA play an important role in the regulation of feeding behavior, we hypothesized that there might be a sex difference in the activity of MCH neurons in the LHA during fasting and/or after glucose injection.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In support of this view, hypothalamic MCH neurons are suggested to be involved in estrogen-induced weight loss in male rats (27).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We therefore examined the response of MCH neurons to an iv injection of glucose after 48 h of fasting in adult male and female rats, using the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity as a marker of neural activity.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	32	 On the assumption that a sex difference in MCH neurons existed, we also examined whether it could be affected by gonadal steroid hormones such as testosterone and/or estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	33	In the present study, we used pCREB as a marker for neural activity increased of the generally used c-Fos, because an increase in the expression of c-Fos needs transcription and/or translation to occur (28), it takes a long time to see changes, and it would be difficult to examine acute changes in response to glucose.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In contrast, CREB is a constitutively expressed transcription factor and can be immediately activated by phosphorylation via a cAMP- and calcium-dependent cascade (29, 30).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, we thought that pCREB was a suitable marker to examine neural activity that changes within a short period in response to dynamic changes such as blood glucose concentrations.

0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	201	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The present study demonstrated sex differences in the response of MCH neurons to glucose, using the expression of pCREB as a marker of neural activity.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Fasting for 48 h activated MCH neurons in a similar manner in both male and female rats, but inactivation of MCH neurons by glucose after 48 h of fasting occurred more rapidly in female rats than in male rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	203	 These sex differences could be attributed to gonadal steroid hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Taking into account both the orexigenic effect of MCH (14, 15) and the glucostatic theory of feeding (36), our findings provide a molecular/neurotransmitter basis for neurons that are controlled by glucose in the LHA and suggest that MCH neurons in the LHA play an important role in sex differences in feeding behavior, acting through the CREB pathway (29, 30).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	205	Although hypoglycemia caused by treatments such as fasting, insulin injection, or 2-deoxy-D-glucose injection increases the expression of hypothalamic MCH mRNA (14, 22, 23), there is little information on the second messenger system that would be stimulated by hypoglycemic conditions.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	206	 For example, Fos expression was increased in the LHA by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but there were few MCH neurons that expressed Fos protein (22, 37).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus, it is unclear whether Fos proteins are involved in the control of the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA by hypoglycemia.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In experiment 1, we showed that under normal feeding conditions in male and female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined, approximately 10% of MCH neurons expressed pCREB-immunoreactive nuclei in the LHA, indicating that only a small population of MCH neurons is active in the LHA.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, we found that fasting for 48 h increased the ratio of double-stained neurons to approximately 40% in both sexes.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Furthermore, we showed that this fasting-induced increase was independent of the presence of testosterone or estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This is the first demonstration that MCH neurons express pCREB in their nuclei in response to fasting and is in good accord with the results of a previous study showing that fasting for 48 h increased pCREB levels in nuclear extracts from the rat hypothalamus, although which neurons expressed the pCREB was not shown (38).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	212	 An analog of cAMP and agents that increase levels of endogenous cAMP and promote phosphorylation of CREB (29) were reported to elicit a vigorous feeding response when microinjected into the LHA (39).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Thus, pCREB can be a reliable marker of activation of MCH neurons by 48-h fasting, and phosphorylation of CREB, probably promoted by an increase in cAMP, may contribute at least in part to the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	214	 We thus suggest that there is no sex difference in the fasting-induced activation of MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	215	We also examined changes in the activity of MCH neurons after glucose injection in 48-h fasted rats in experiment 1 and found that a significant decrease in the ratio of double-stained neurons was induced after 5 min only in female rats at all stages of the estrous cycle examined.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In contrast to female rats, MCH neurons in male rats failed to respond to glucose within 5 min.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Additional time-course studies in experiment 2 demonstrated that MCH neurons in male rats responded to glucose 15 to 30 min after glucose injection, whereas those in female rats, at the stage that was most insensitive to glucose, MCH neurons responded after 5 to 15 min.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In this study we found a clear sex difference in the response of MCH neurons to glucose; the response of MCH neurons to glucose was delayed in male rats compared with that in female rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This is not due to differences in blood glucose concentrations, because there was no sex difference in blood glucose concentrations after glucose injection between intact male and female rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Furthermore, this is not due to sex differences in insulin secretion in response to glucose, because there was no sex difference in the effect of castration on insulin secretion and thus it could not explain the results of experiment 3.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	221	 One possible reason for this delay in the decrease in pCREB may be that the sensitivity of MCH neurons to glucose in male rats is less than that in female rats, and thus MCH neurons do not respond to an increase in glucose concentrations in blood, resulting in a delay of the decrease in pCREB.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	222	 According to the glucostatic theory that an increase in glucose in blood is a signal for meal termination (33), the dietary glucose may inactivate the orexigenic activity of MCH neurons and induce meal termination more rapidly in female rats than in male rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This may account for the sex difference in meal size, which is smaller in females than in males (1, 2).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Although glucose-sensing neurons may respond to physiological changes in blood glucose and regulate integrative metabolic functions, such as counterregulatory responses, food intake, and metabolic rate (40), the glucostatic theory by itself is not sufficient to explain the complex regulation of feeding behavior (41).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Glucose is, obviously, only one of several peripheral metabolic signals involved in the regulation of feeding behavior under physiological conditions (42).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Hence, we speculate that the inactivation of MCH neurons by metabolic signals after feeding is faster in females than in males.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	227	We currently do not know how glucose acts on MCH neurons.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	228	 However, judging from an electrophysiological study showing that some neurons in the LHA respond to changes in glucose concentration in vitro (43), a direct effect of glucose on MCH neurons is likely.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Effects of afferent signals from glucose sensors localized at different central and peripheral structures are also likely (41, 44).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In the hypothalamus, NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus have been shown to be glucose-sensitive neurons in an in vitro electrophysiological study (45).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Considering the hypothalamic circuit involving the LHA and arcuate nucleus (19), it is probable that glucose affects MCH neurons indirectly via NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	232	We also found in the present study that the response of MCH neurons to glucose varied depending on the stage of the estrous cycle, i.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	233	 the magnitude of decrease in the number of double-stained neurons after glucose injection was greater at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	234	 An additional time-course study confirmed that the ratio of double-stained neurons at diestrus 2 decreased 15 min after glucose injection to approximately 10%, which was similar to the levels at proestrus and estrus 5 min after glucose injection, indicating that the response of MCH neurons to glucose at diestrus 2 was the most delayed.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	235	 As discussed above, if the decrease in the activity of MCH neurons is related to meal termination, it follows that meal termination occurs more rapidly at proestrus and estrus than at diestrus 2.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In support of this, the meal size was smaller at proestrus or estrus than at diestrus (2, 4).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Therefore, MCH neurons may also participate in the fluctuation of feeding behavior during the estrous cycle.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	238	Our findings in experiment 3 indicate that the sex difference in MCH neurons is at least in part attributable to the presence of gonadal steroid hormones in adults.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	239	 That is, the presence of testosterone in males and that of estrogen in females are critical to the male- and female-type responses of MCH neurons to glucose.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In male rats, we found that orchidectomy significantly enhanced the response of MCH neurons to glucose, but testosterone replacement attenuated the effect.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Because orchidectomy decreased food intake (46), and this effect was reversed by testosterone replacement in ORX rats (7, 47, 48), we speculate that testosterone attenuates the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals and then increases food intake in males.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In contrast, estrogen replacement did not cause any significant effect on orchidectomy-induced enhancement of the response to glucose in male rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This result is in good accord with a report that food intake in ORX rats is relatively insensitive to the influence of estrogen compared with that in OVX rats (8).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The results of the present study in male rats therefore suggest that estrogen could no longer enhance the response of MCH neurons to glucose, because orchidectomy caused the response to reach its maximum.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	245	In female rats, ovariectomy attenuated the response of MCH neurons to glucose, and estrogen replacement prevented ovariectomy-induced attenuation of the response.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	246	 These results are in good accord with previous studies in which ovariectomy in adult female rats increased food intake (7, 46), and this effect was reversed by estrogen replacement (6).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Thus, it can be easily hypothesized that estrogen enhances the response of MCH neurons to metabolic signals in females and causes decreases in food intake and body weight.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In support of this, estrogen inhibited the expression of MCH mRNA in the LHA of female (49) and male (27) rats.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In contrast to the effect of testosterone in ORX rats, testosterone enhanced the response of MCH neurons in OVX rats as estrogen did.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This effect of testosterone in OVX rats could be explained by postulating that testosterone enhances the response of MCH neurons after being converted to estrogen.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In support of this speculation, it has been suggested that in male rats, the reduced food intake and weight gain seen during high-dose testosterone treatment are due to aromatization of testosterone to estrogen (8).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In light of previous reports that females are more sensitive to the effect of estrogen on food intake than males (8, 50) and males are more sensitive to the effect of testosterone on food intake (47, 50), the present study indicates that the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons in females is not testosterone-induced attenuation, but is estrogen-induced enhancement.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In males, in contrast, the dominant effect of testosterone on the response of MCH neurons is not estrogen-induced enhancement, but is testosterone-induced attenuation.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Hence, the present study may provide a neural basis for the sex difference in feeding behavior, although the mechanisms of action of estrogen and testosterone need to be determined in future studies.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	255	Recent reports demonstrating that estrogen attenuates neuroendocrine responses to hypoglycemia in women (51) and female rats (52) suggest that estrogen enhances the effects of glucose in the brain.
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In light of the results of the present study, estrogen may enhance glucose transport and its metabolism in the brain (53, 54, 55).
0.119480975.15905320.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This suggests that one mechanism by which estrogen exerts its widely reported protective effects in the brain (56) is by enhancing glucose transport and metabolism.
