0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	5	Apoptosis plays an important role in homeostasis of intestinal epithelia and is also a stress response to toxic stimuli.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Transgenic and knockout mice have provided insights into the regulation of intestinal epithelial apoptosis that could not have been obtained by cell culture techniques.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Two broad types of apoptosis have been characterized: spontaneous apoptosis, which occurs continuously at low levels in the normal, unstressed intestine, and stress-induced apoptosis, which occurs after genotoxic insult such as exposure to gamma radiation or DNA-damaging drugs.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Spontaneous apoptosis occurs at the base of the crypt at or near the position of epithelial stem cells.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Knockout studies have shown that spontaneous apoptosis is independent of p53 and Bax in both small and large intestine, whereas Bcl2 only regulates spontaneous apoptosis in the colon.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Little is known about the regulation of the specialized form of cell death at the villus tip.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, knockout studies have demonstrated that both p53 and Bcl2 are important regulators of stress-induced apoptosis but that there are significant differences between early and late time points.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Bax plays only a minor role in the regulation of stress-induced apoptosis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The cumulative effect of stress-induced apoptosis on tissue architecture is not straightforward, and cell cycle arrest also plays a critical role.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Nevertheless, p53 is an important determinant of the histopathological damage induced by 5-fluorouracil in murine intestinal epithelium.

0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	19	IT HAS BEEN KNOWN for several decades that programmed cell death is essential for the growth and development of multicellular organisms.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, it was not until 1972 that Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie (10) coined the term "apoptosis" and described its defining morphological features.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Since then, it has become clear that apoptosis is also important in the development of the immune system, is a major mechanism of immune-mediated cytotoxicity, and participates in deletion of cells with potentially carcinogenic mutations.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In disease pathogenesis, apoptosis can be either inappropriately excessive or deficient and has been implicated in a wide variety of gastrointestinal conditions including Helicobacter-associated gastritis, Shigella flexneri dysentery, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal neoplasia.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Furthermore, anticancer drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce apoptosis (25).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	24	Apoptosis plays an important role in determining the architecture of intestinal epithelia and is also a part of the stress response of intestinal epithelial cells to toxic stimuli.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Rather than being a single process, a number of mechanistically distinct pathways to apoptosis can be discerned in intestinal epithelia, which depend on the physical position of the cell along the crypt/villus axis, its level of differentiation, and the type of stimulus involved.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	26	The study of apoptosis in gastrointestinal epithelium has been greatly hampered by slow progress in the development of suitable in vitro models of normal intestinal epithelial cells.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All established gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines are abnormal by definition as they are immortalized with a disturbed balance between rates of cell death and proliferation.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Such cell lines probably have abnormal apoptosis mechanisms.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Also, many of the more commonly used cell lines are also fully transformed.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, the gastrointestinal epithelium is a complex tissue in which epithelial cells undergo a differentiation program and receive signals from extracellular matrix, neighboring cells, and circulating hormones, all of which potentially influence apoptosis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For these reasons, study of the regulation of apoptosis under normal physiological conditions has been largely restricted to techniques based on analysis of histological sections of intact epithelium.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In this themes article, we shall review the information gained on the regulation of apoptosis from transgenic and knockout mice.

0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	35	The small intestine provides a unique opportunity for studying the influence of differentiation pathways on apoptosis as cells at different stages of differentiation can be identified simply through their position along the crypt/villus axis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The intestinal epithelium is a self-renewing monolayer arising from stem cells located at or near the base of crypts (22).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	37	 One can identify their position by counting cell positions from the base of the crypt.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In the small intestine, stem cells are believed to be located at cell positions 3-5, whereas in the large intestine they are located at cell positions 1-2.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Unfortunately, there are no biochemical or molecular markers for intestinal stem cells and their positions have been implied from indirect experimental techniques and mathematical modeling (22).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Daughter cells undergo four to six rounds of cell division to form a cohort of transit cells that populate the midportion of the crypt.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	41	 These cells differentiate into four cell lineages.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Absorptive enterocytes, comprising 80% of all epithelial cells, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells all continue to migrate up the crypt.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Paneth cells are a fourth lineage, located at the base of the crypt below the putative position of stem cells.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	44	 As cells exit the crypt onto the villus, they stop cycling and become trapped in the G1 phase of the cell cycle as a result of downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (2).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	45	 As they migrate up the crypt, they continue to differentiate and express a new repertoire of proteins such as brush-border hydrolases.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	46	 After 2-3 days, they reach this villus tip where, in the mouse, they are shed at a rate of 1,400 cells   villus1   24 h1 (22).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Thus the intestinal epithelium has one of the most rapid turnover rates among mammalian tissues.

0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	49	 GENETIC REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	50	Mice that have been rendered homozygously null for genes that regulate apoptosis have proved extremely valuable in determining the mandatory role of a protein in controlling apoptosis in intestinal epithelium.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Experiments involving these mice have often provided evidence that confirms previous immunohistochemical studies, yet these experiments have the additional advantages of allowing damage-induced apoptosis to be easily studied while avoiding some of the technical problems associated with the immunohistochemical process.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	52	Investigations of the levels and cell positions of spontaneous apoptosis can provide evidence for the roles played by these genes during homeostasis within the epithelium.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In addition, studies of the apoptosis induced in the epithelium by gamma radiation and cytotoxic drugs can demonstrate how these genes influence the response of the intestine to damage.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Genotoxic stimuli can also be used to investigate whether the genes that regulate acute apoptosis also modulate the long-term histopathological outcome of the epithelium in response to cytotoxic damage.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	55	 One note of caution should be mentioned when interpreting any experiments involving "knockout" mice, namely, that any observed effects may have arisen not only from absence of the gene being investigated but also from compensatory changes in other gene products, which may have occurred during the animal's development.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	56	 For example, Bcl2 knockout mice have severe developmental abnormalities of the kidneys, causing renal failure (19).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	57	 It is at least theoretically possible that abnormalities in apoptosis in these mice are due to the sequelae of renal failure rather than to a direct result of Bcl2 deficiency.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	58	To date, knockout mice have been used to determine how p53 and two Bcl2 family members, Bcl2 and Bax, affect both spontaneous and damage-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelia (see Table 1).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Obviously, these genes are likely to represent only the tip of the iceberg, and similar experiments using a range of other knockout mice will be necessary to establish a comprehensive picture of gene-regulating apoptosis in intestinal epithelium.

0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	63	 GENETIC REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	64	In the unstressed intestine two apoptotic pathways have been identified.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The first takes place in the crypt at the level of the stem and early transit cells and is sometimes referred to as "spontaneous" apoptosis, although in fact the trigger has not been identified.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This spontaneous apoptosis takes place at a low rate and is thought to regulate the number of cells entering the crypt/villus axis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	67	 It is readily identified as apoptotic bodies in histological sections fixed in Carnoy's medium stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Mice that are p53 deficient (7) show similar levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium compared with their wild-type counterparts (3, 16).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This suggests that p53 plays little part in normal homeostasis in this tissue.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	70	Homozygous Bcl2-null mice (19, 20) demonstrate levels of spontaneous apoptosis in small intestinal crypts similar to their wild-type counterparts.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In the colon, however, Bcl2/ mice show elevated levels of spontaneous apoptosis, and this is concentrated at cell positions 1-2 at the base of the crypt (17).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	72	 This is the location of Bcl2 protein expression found by immunohis-tochemical studies and is also the presumed location of colonic stem cells.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	73	 This observation suggests that Bcl2 expression plays a part in homeostasis of normal colonic epithelium, although its precise role remains to be established, since the actual morphology of the colonic epithelium is normal in Bcl2/ mice (19, 20).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	74	 In contrast, Bax expression appears to have little effect on homeostasis in normal intestinal epithelium, as Bax/ mice (11) show the same levels of spontaneous apoptosis as their wild-type counterparts in both small intestine and midcolon (24).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This correlates well with the observed immunohistochemical distribution of Bax expression in those small intestinal cell lineages that are not crucial for maintenance of epithelial renewal, namely, differentiated Paneth cells and villus enterocytes (13).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	76	Apoptosis may also participate in the shedding process at the villus tip (for review, see Ref.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Careful studies with electron microscopy have demonstrated that neighboring epithelial cells extend processes underneath the cell to be extruded and form a tight junction.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This tight junction then migrates toward the lumen like a "zipper," pushing the cell to be shed out of the monolayer.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Apoptotic morphology is only seen rarely during this extrusion process; the shed cells only take on apoptotic morphology once free in the lumen (27).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	80	 It is not known at which point along the crypt/villus axis the process of apoptosis begins.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This is because most of the important signal transduction events take place while the cell is morphologically normal.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Nevertheless, at least some early apoptotic events must take place while the cell is within the monolayer, since activation of caspase-3, a member of the principal effector enzyme family of apoptosis, takes place at the villus tip (21).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	83	Few data are available on the regulation of cell loss at the villus tip.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	84	 It is clear that this shedding process is tightly regulated.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	85	 It is unknown whether apoptosis itself is the regulated event or whether apoptosis is merely secondary to detachment from basement membrane.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Bcl2 does not appear to regulate cell shedding, as villus dimensions are normal in mice with forced overexpression of Bcl2 in villus epithelial cells (6).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	87	 A particularly fascinating point is that the rate of cell loss at the villus tip must be tightly coupled with cell production at the base of the crypt.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This implies that there must be a feedback loop between the crypt and villus tip, but the anatomic basis for such a feedback loop is unknown.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	89	 One possibility is that / T cells migrating from the villus tip act as messengers to the crypt cells, as knockout studies have demonstrated that they are capable of reducing crypt cell production rate (12).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is another candidate for regulating the shedding process on the villus.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Raised levels of GLP-2 are known to increase villus length, possibly through inhibition of apoptosis at the villus tip and increased proliferation in the crypt (28).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Very recently, the human and mouse GLP-2 receptor has been cloned and characterized as a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (18).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	93	 It is unknown whether this receptor participates in the regulation of apoptosis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	94	Apoptosis is never seen along the length of the villus of the unstressed intestine except under highly artificial conditions.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This is not because the villus cells are postmitotic, since forcing villus cells back into cycle through the overexpression of SV40 large T antigen does not restore radiation-induced apoptosis (5).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Mice that express a dominant negative N-cadherin in their villus cells have spontaneous apoptosis along the length of the villus in addition to developing an inflammatory bowel disease reminiscent of Crohn's disease and colonic adenomas (9).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	97	    STRESS-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION STRUCTURE AND CELL KINETICS.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	98	 GENETIC REGULATION OF APOPTOSIS.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Studies of the apoptosis induced in p53/ mice by administration of genotoxic stimuli have revealed that p53 is a crucial determinant of the apoptosis that occurs within a few hours of damage.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The first observations of damage-induced apoptosis in this setting demonstrated that p53/ mice showed absence of intestinal apoptosis, which is normally observed in p53 wild-type animals during the 3-4 h period following gamma radiation (3, 16).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This observation correlated well with immunohistochemical studies in wild-type mice following the same stimulus of gamma radiation, since analysis of the cell positional distribution of immunohistochemical p53 protein expression was coincident with the position of apoptotic cells in the small intestine following 8-Gy gamma radiation(16).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	102	The acute apoptosis induced within a few hours of gamma radiation was therefore demonstrated to be completely p53 dependent.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	103	 What, however, was the long-term fate of the p53-null cells that had undergone significant DNA damage but had not been immediately deleted by apoptosis? Histological assessment of small intestinal epithelium 24 h after gamma radiation showed that significant numbers of apoptotic cells were present after 8 Gy, but very few were present after the lesser stimulus of 1 Gy.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	104	 With the use of electron microscopy, the morphology of the apoptotic cells seen 24 h after 8-Gy gamma radiation in p53/ mice suggested that these cells might have arisen as a result of aberrant mitosis (4, 15).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	105	 p53-Independent mechanisms of apoptosis therefore exist to delete cells that have been damaged by high doses of radiation, but this p53-independent apoptosis is observed several hours later than the p53-dependent wave of apoptosis.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	106	p53 expression also effects the acute intestinal apoptosis induced within 24 h by the alternative stimulus of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil, since p53-null mice show many fewer apoptotic cells than their wild-type counterparts after administration of this agent (26).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, the apoptosis induced by 40 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil was not influenced by coadministration of 500 mg/kg thymidine but was significantly rescued by 3,500 mg/kg uridine given 2 h after the cytotoxic stimulus.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This suggests that the p53-dependent apoptosis induced by 5-fluorouracil occurs as a result of the RNA-damaging mechanism of the drug rather than as a result of DNA damage consequent on thymidylate synthase inhibition.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This was confirmed by experiments utilizing the pure thymidylate synthase inhibitor Raltitrexed (Tomudex, ZD-1694), which has no RNA-damaging effects.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The apoptosis induced in small intestinal epithelium by this drug was completely rescued by coadministration of 500 mg/kg thymidine, yet was p53 independent, with no difference in apoptotic yield observed between p53 wild-type and null mice (Ref.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	111	 26 and Pritchard, unpublished observations).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This finding also illustrates that the intestinal apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents is not always p53 dependent and is influenced by the mechanism of damage caused by the drug.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	113	The experiments described above have demonstrated that the acute apoptosis induced within a few hours of administration of gamma radiation and 5-fluorouracil is exquisitely p53 dependent.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	114	 High doses of these cytotoxins also have long-term consequences in the intestine, manifested as histopathological changes such as villus shortening and ulceration and demonstrated clinically by reduced absorptive capacity of the gut and diarrhea.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Does p53 expression also modulate this long-term response of the intestine to toxic damage? One way of investigating this has been to use clonogenic crypt survival following gamma radiation as an indicator of long-term intestinal fate.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	116	 p53/ mice showed no difference in crypt survival in the small intestine following gamma radiation ( > 10 Gy) compared with their wild-type counterparts; rather, they paradoxically showed decreased crypt survival in the large intestine as measured by the crypt microcolony assay (8, 15).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	117	 These observations suggest that absence of p53 expression does not protect the epithelium from the long-term effects of gamma radiation.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	118	However, a subsequent study using different methodology and the alternative cytotoxic stimulus of 5-fluorouracil gave somewhat different results.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	119	 By assessing changes in epithelial histology, such as changes in crypt and villus length and cell number, it was demonstrated that p53/ mice showed significantly less histopathological intestinal damage than their wild-type counterparts 72-96 h after the administration of two doses of 400 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (23).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This effect was not simply a reflection of the p53-null mice showing less apoptosis within the first 24 h after drug administration but, additionally, resulted from the lack of p53-dependent inhibition of cell cycle progression.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	121	 It will be interesting to investigate this further using mice rendered homozygously null for p21Waf1/Cip1.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This gene product acts downstream of p53 to cause G1 cell cycle arrest.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Immunohistochemical studies have previously suggested that expression of this protein is important in determining the response of intestinal epithelium to damage (29).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	124	How can the results of the studies described above involving gamma radiation and 5-fluorouracil be reconciled? A number of factors must be considered.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	125	 First, the methods used to assess long-term fate were different between studies.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Second, the stimuli induce cytotoxicity in different ways: gamma radiation causes DNA damage directly, whereas 5-fluorouracil causes cytotoxicity by RNA perturbation (26).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Third, very high doses of gamma radiation, in excess of 10 Gy, are required for the crypt microcolony assay.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Such doses may completely overwhelm a cell's metabolic responses, so that any differences that may have emerged with a less severe stimulus might remain hidden.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The Bcl2 family consists of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (1).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	130	 A cell's capacity to undergo apoptosis is probably determined by the ratio of all Bcl2 family members expressed within it.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Knockout studies uniquely enable the contribution of an individual family member to be studied within the context of a complex tissue in vivo.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Three to four hours following stimulation by gamma radiation, Bcl2/ mice show similar levels of small intestinal apoptosis as their wild-type counterparts.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, as with spontaneous apoptosis, elevated levels of damage-induced apoptosis are observed in the colon.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This colonic apoptosis again occurs specifically at those cell positions at the base of colonic crypts, which are believed to harbor the colonic stem cells (17).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	135	 A similar picture is also seen using the alternative cytotoxic stimulus of 5-fluorouracil, in that Bcl2/ mice demonstrate significantly greater levels of apoptosis particularly at the base of colonic crypts 4.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	136	5 h after 40 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (24).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	137	 However, 24 h after 40 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil administration, there was no significant difference in apoptotic yield between Bcl2 wild-type and null mice, suggesting that, in this setting, Bcl2 expression serves to delay the onset of apoptosis rather than prevent it completely (24).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The long-term effects of the protection of stem cells at positions 1-2 at the early time points after 5-fluorouracil administration require a long-term toxicological study of gut integrity, as has been described above for p53/ animals.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	139	In contrast to p53 and Bcl2, Bax expression appears to play very little role in the regulation of damage-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelium.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Bax/ mice show no significant difference in apoptotic yield compared with their wild-type counterparts in small intestine or midcolon 4.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	141	5 h after 1 Gy or 8 Gy of gamma radiation or 40 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil administration and only a small reduction in apoptotic yield 24 h after 40 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil administration (24).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The contrast between the effects of Bax and p53 expression on the apoptosis induced in intestinal epithelium by both gamma radiation and 5-fluorouracil suggests that Bax expression is not an important determinant of the p53-mediated induction of apoptosis in this setting.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Other downstream factors are thus likely to be responsible for the pro-apoptotic effects of p53 in this tissue following cytotoxic stimuli.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Experiments similar to those described above have not yet been conducted in mice that have been rendered homozygously null for other members of the Bcl2 family.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Hence, the effects of these gene products on spontaneous and damage-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelium remain to be established.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	146	Ischemia-reperfusion-induced apoptosis is another example of stress-induced apoptosis, which contrasts with radiation-induced apoptosis in revealing ways (6).
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The ischemia-reperfusion injury is caused by temporary occlusion of the blood supply followed by its restoration.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This stimulus induces apoptosis in both the crypt and villus and is independent of p53 but inhibited by Bcl2.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This tells us that epithelial cells on the villus have the molecular machinery to undergo apoptosis but for some reason it is not activated by radiation.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	150	 One can speculate that apoptosis on the villus is induced by reintroduction of a blood borne factor, which is destroyed by radiation.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	151	In conclusion, knockout studies have provided results that could not have been obtained from experiments utilizing either the cell lines available today or human samples.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In addition, they have yielded mechanistic information that could not be gained from immunohistochemical studies.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Nevertheless, they have significant disadvantages in that generating a single knockout strain is both time consuming and expensive and numerous strains are necessary to dissect the complex interrelationships among all the apoptosis regulators relevant to intestinal epithelium.
0.5345665.10644554.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, such studies are vital for the rational design of new and more effective therapies for major intestinal epithelial diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.

0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	3	   Abstract Top Abstract Main text References   The p51/p63/KET proteins were identified based on their strong homology to the tumour suppressor p53 and a related set of proteins termed p73.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	4	 All these protein species were shown to activate transcription from at least some p53-responsive promoters.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To evaluate a possible role of the transcriptionally active splicing variant p51A/p63 in tumour suppression, we determined whether viral oncoproteins that inactivate p53 might also target p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Neither the large T-antigen of simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) nor the E6 protein from human papillomavirus type 18 were found to inhibit p51A-mediated transcription, whereas they strongly suppress the activity of p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Further, SV40 T-antigen directly interacts with p53 but not detectably with p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Finally, a cytoplasmic mutant (K128A) of SV40 T-antigen relocalizes p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but p51A remains in the nucleus when coexpressed with cytoplasmic T-antigen.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of these viral oncoproteins is specific for p53 and does not measurably affect p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, unlike p53, p51A does not appear to be a necessary target in virus-induced cell transformation and may not exert a role comparable to p53 in tumour suppression.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	11	   Main text Top Abstract Main text References   The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene in human malignancies, and all known small DNA tumour viruses express proteins that inactivate the p53 protein.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These and many other lines of evidence support the view that p53 is a central factor in the control of malignant growth (Levine, 1997 ).
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it was discovered that p53 is not the only factor of its kind in mammalian cells.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Rather, gene products with strong homologies to p53 were identified.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These p53 homologues were each found to be expressed in several splicing variants.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The first p53 homologue to be reported was termed p73 (Kaghad et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	17	 p73 was subsequently shown to induce transcription and apoptosis in a manner similar to p53 (Jost et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	18	, 1997 ), but some splicing variants of p73 lack these activities (De Laurenzi et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Another protein (and its splicing variants) with strong homologies to p53 and even more pronounced similarity to p73 was identified from human, murine and rat cells, and termed p51 (Osada et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	20	, 1998 ) or KET (Schmale  and  Bamberger, 1997 ).
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A particularly active splicing variant of this factor was termed p51A (Osada et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	22	, 1998 ), and this splicing form was examined in the present study.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	23	 While this and other splicing variants of p51 have been shown to activate transcription in a manner analogous to p53 and p73 (Osada et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1998 ), it remains to be shown whether p51 is a growth regulator that inhibits the development of malignant tumors, like p53, or whether it performs functions other than tumour suppression.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mice lacking the p51/p63 gene have been developed.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These mice are born alive but carry severe developmental defects (Mills et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	27	, 1999 ) and may therefore not live up to the formation of tumors, even if tumour development was facilitated by the absence of p51.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Therefore, the role of p51 in cancer needs to be evaluated by different approaches.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	29	 One way of doing so is to determine if viral oncoproteins evolved to target p51 in addition to p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This approach was previously used to examine p73.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It was shown that the E1B 55 kDa protein from adenovirus (Higashino et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	32	, 1999 ), the large T-antigen from simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) (Dobbelstein  and  Roth, 1998 ; Higashino et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	33	, 1999 ) and the E6 proteins from oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) (Marin et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	34	, 1998 ) all fail to functionally interact with p73 but do efficiently bind and inactivate p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These results suggest that virus-mediated malignant transformation can occur without inactivating p73 but usually requires the targeting of p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In this study, we examined the ability of SV40 T-antigen and HPV-18 E6 protein to interact with p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Our results suggest that p51A, like p73, does not represent a target for these viral oncoproteins.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	38	We first determined if the expression of viral oncoproteins inhibits the transcriptional activity of p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	39	 For these experiments, the p51A splicing form was chosen since it shows considerably stronger transcriptional activity in reporter assays when compared to the p51B splicing form (Osada et al.

0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, upon co-expression of p53 with cytoplasmic T-antigen, p53 was found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig.

0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In contrast, p51A remained in the nucleus of the cell (Fig.

0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Thus, cytoplasmic T-antigen relocalizes p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but does not affect the location of p51A.

0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	102	  Our results show that viral oncoproteins from HPV and SV40 do not detectably antagonize the activity of p51A but specifically inactivate p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The E1B 55 kDa protein of adenovirus type 5 seems to display a similar specificity (our unpublished observations).
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This does not preclude that other viral or cellular proteins might target p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, at least the SV40 T-antigen alone is already sufficient to mediate the transformation of various cell types, yet does not bind p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This argues that p51A inactivation is not a prerequisite for virus-mediated malignant transformation, whereas all known small DNA tumour viruses have devised a mechanism to control p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Therefore, it seems likely that p53 and p51A do not perform equivalent roles in tumour suppression.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	108	While our results show that the HPV-18 E6 protein fails to downregulate p51A-mediated transcription, the reason for this is currently unknown.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It is well established that p53 is inactivated by HPV-18 E6 through a complex mechanism that not only includes a direct interaction between p53 and HPV-18 E6, but also the association with another cellular protein termed E6AP.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	110	 p53 is then ubiquitinylated and degraded (Huibregtse et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	111	 It is subject to further investigations whether all of these steps occur specifically on p53 but not p51A, or whether HPV-18 E6 might still form a complex with p51A and E6AP5 without mediating the intracellular degradation of p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	112	At present, it remains possible that the p51 gene does not represent a tumour suppressor gene at all.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	113	 If so, what other function(s) might be associated with this protein? Studies on mice carrying a targeted disruption of the p51/p63 gene suggest that p51 proteins are required for proper development of the limb and ectodermal structures (Mills et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Such a role in development has not been reported for p53 (Donehower et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Thus, the p51 gene and its products may carry out important functions during development, but the limited life span of these mice makes it difficult to draw any conclusions on its role in tumorigenesis.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The results presented here suggest that its function in tumour suppression may not be comparable to the role of p53.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The ultimate answer on the importance of p51 in tumour development can be expected from detailed studies on p51 mutations and expression patterns in tumour tissue.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In the case of the first p53 homologue to be identified, p73, such studies revealed that the corresponding gene does not display the features of a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the tumour species examined (Mai et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The failure of viral oncoproteins to interact with p51A suggests that the same might turn out to be true for the p51 gene.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, until the mutational status of the p51 gene and other p53 homologues that might exist (Bian  and  Sun, 1997 ; Zeng et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	121	, 1998 ) are fully characterized, it is still not certain whether p53 may have one or several  Doppelganger  (Kaelin, 1998 ) that can actually replace some of its tumour suppressing functions.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	122	Despite the functional differences between p53 and its homologues encoded by the p73 and p51 genes, we and others have shown that the mdm2 protein antagonizes p73-mediated transcription in addition to regulating p53 (Dobbelstein et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We have tested the ability of mdm2 to bind p51A (our unpublished observations).
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	124	 While p51A can be shown to bind mdm2 in vitro, we did not observe inhibitory effects of mdm2 on p51A-mediated transcription in our assays (data not shown).
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Differences in turnover and/or DNA binding affinities between p53 and p51A may explain this phenomenon.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	126	 At present, it is unclear whether mdm2 can actually inhibit p51A in a physiological setting.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	127	 However, it is tempting to speculate that antagonizing effects of mdm2 on p73 and possibly p51A may affect embryonic development.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	128	How can the different functional roles of p53 and its homologues be explained on a mechanistic level? First, despite the abilities of all three protein species to activate transcription from different promoters, quantitative differences in promoter specificity between p53 and p73 have been demonstrated (Zhu et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Such differences may also exist between p53 and p51A.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Nonetheless, all three protein species not only activate p53-responsive promoters but also induce apoptosis (Jost et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	131	, 1998 ), which is generally thought to be an essential activity for p53-mediated tumour suppression.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	132	 However, another important feature that determines the biological role of these proteins is likely to be in the regulation of their expression.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Indeed, it has been shown that p53 accumulation can be induced by genotoxic stress, while the levels of p73 do not seem to be upregulated under such circumstances (Kaghad et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Further, p53 is found at low but ubiquitous levels, whereas tissue-specific expression was observed for the p73 and p51 genes (Kaghad et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In addition to overall expression, p73 and p51 (but not human p53) can be regulated by alternative splicing, resulting in transcriptionally inactive forms (De Laurenzi et al.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	136	, 1998 ) that may even exert dominant negative effects on the transcription from p53-responsive promoters.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 homologues may, in principle, be able to carry out the biochemical activities needed for tumour suppression, but that their expression may not generally be regulated in a way appropriate to achieve this.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In such a scenario, the growth of tumour cells carrying mutant p53 might be controlled by a strategy aimed at the expression of transcriptionally active p73 and p51 proteins in these cells.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	139	 If the expression of such p53 homologues could be achieved, this would represent a novel therapeutic approach to suppress tumour growth.
0.51450485.10567658.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The failure of viral oncoproteins, like HPV E6, to inhibit p51A and p73 may then represent an advantage that facilitates the reconstitution of growth control.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Differences between species in pathways contributing to tumor development, however, raise the question in how far mouse models are valid for human risk assessment.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	7	 One striking difference relates to the frequency of spontaneous liver cancer which is high in certain mouse strains but rather low in humans.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Similarly, mutation frequencies in cancer genes are characteristically different, i.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	9	 P53 mutations are frequent in human but very rare in murine liver tumors, whereas Ras genes are often mutated in mouse liver tumors but hardly ever in human liver cancers.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Since P53 has been shown to control oncogenic RAS in human cells, we hypothesized that this function of the tumor suppressor could differ in mouse hepatocytes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	11	 To test this hypothesis, we used hupki (human p53 knock-in) mice which carry a partly humanized P53 sequence (P53KI).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In this study, we report the results of the first hepatocarcinogenesis experiment with this strain of mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mice of the genotypes P53KI/KI, P53WT/KI and P53WT/WT were treated with N-nitrosodiethylamine at 2 weeks of age and killed 35 weeks later.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The frequency of liver tumors and glucose-6-phosphatase-altered liver lesions was almost identical in all three P53 genotypes and 40 to 50% of liver tumors showed activating mutations in codon 61 of the Ha-Ras gene independent of genotype.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Moreover, only very few P53-positive lesions were observed but without nuclear localization of the protein, suggesting the absence of P53 mutations.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These data suggest that the hupki allele behaves like its murine ortholog in mouse hepatocarcinogenesis.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	18	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are one of the ten most frequent human cancers worldwide (1).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Risk factors like hepatitis B and C virus and aflatoxins as given in southern Africa and southern China make HCC the most frequent cause of cancer death in these countries.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Most populations from industrialized countries, however, show a comparatively low incidence of HCC, indicating that development of  spontaneous  HCC is a rather rare event in humans.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	21	 By contrast, certain strains of laboratory mice, e.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	22	 C3H, show a very high incidence of spontaneous liver tumors which can reach up to 100% at the end of the animals' lives (2).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These opposing findings are paralleled by differences at the molecular level.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	24	 One of the most striking differences lies in the mutation frequencies of genes in two pathways, namely the P53 and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	25	The transcription factor P53 is a well-known tumor suppressor protein that induces cell growth arrest, apoptosis and senescence in response to various types of stress.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In unstressed cells, P53 is maintained at low levels by the action of the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 which earmarks P53 for degradation in the proteasome (3).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	27	 MDM2 can also bind to the transactivation domain of P53 thus reducing its transcriptional activity (4).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	28	 DNA damage or oncogenic stress, e.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	29	 caused by mutated CTNNB1 (ss-catenin), c-MYC or RAS lead to a stabilization of the P53 protein (5 to 7) and transcriptional activation of a battery of  caretaker  genes (8).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	30	RAS-mediated signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation, which constitute fundamental processes that are deregulated in tumors carrying mutated Ras genes (9 to 11).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The most common mutations in Ras affect the GTPase activity of the small monomeric G-protein resulting in the constitutively active molecule which may, amongst others, permanently stimulate cell-cycle progression via activation of MAP kinase and other effector pathways (9).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The tumorigenic transformation of cells by Ras oncogenes can be prevented by P53-controlled mechanisms: inappropriate stimulation of cell-cycle progression leads to an E2F-mediated upregulation of the tumor suppressor protein p14/19ARF which can bind MDM2 and inactivate its ability to initiate P53 degradation (7,12 to 14).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, in human cells, P53 controls oncogenic RAS and activation of RAS in tumor cells is often accompanied by ablation of P53-dependent responses.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	34	Inactivation of P53 by mutation is frequently observed in human HCCs (15 to 17) whereas RAS and its downstream effector B-RAF are only very rarely mutated in human HCCs (2,18).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Liver tumors from mice, however, are hardly ever mutated in P53 (2,19) but rather harbor activating mutations in Ha-Ras (20,21) and B-Raf (22).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This evidence could indicate that murine P53 may not control the activated RAS oncoprotein in mouse liver as opposed to its human ortholog, suggesting that the P53 protein may differ in function between mice and men.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Although P53 shows high homology between the two species both in the overall amino acid sequence (74%) and the DNA binding domain (91%), the homology is less in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions and the polyproline domains (PPDs).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Mouse P53 lacks, for example, residues that constitute important phosphorylation sites in its human ortholog, e.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	39	 serine 37 and 46, amino acids which are relevant for the modulation of P53 stress response in cells, and proline 72 with a role in apoptotic responses (23,24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	40	The aim of our present work was to investigate whether structural differences between human and mouse P53 proteins are critical determinants during hepatocarcinogenesis.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	41	 A potent tool to address this question is the transgenic hupki (human p53 knock-in) mouse, in which parts of the murine P53 gene are replaced by the respective human sequences (exons 4 to 9) containing serine 46, proline 72, and threonines 76 and 86 (25).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The Jackson Laboratory Repository designation for the knock-in allele is Trp53tm/Holl; it will be abbreviated as P53KI in the following, as opposed to the wild-type allele (P53+).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The humanized hupki P53 seems to carry out all normal functions of the mouse P53 investigated to this point (25 to 27).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We now analyzed the frequency of liver tumors induced by a single injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) in C3H mice carrying the P53KI allele homozygously or heterozygously in comparison with C3H mice with the wild-type murine P53 (P53+/+).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	45	 C3H mice were chosen because of their high susceptibility to liver tumor formation (28).

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Mice of all three groups showed increased liver weights and liver/body weight ratios caused by the high liver tumor burden, without significant differences between groups (Table I).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In historical controls, untreated wild-type C3H mice showed a liver/body weight ratio of 4 to 5%, a value that was almost doubled in DEN-treated mice of the present study.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	93	  The neoplastic response in liver was determined by enzyme-histochemical staining of frozen sections for G6Pase, which is, under most circumstances, decreased in activity in hepatocellular preneoplastic foci, adenomas and carcinomas, and is frequently employed as a marker for the identification of these lesions (35).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In this study the majority of liver lesions were of a G6Pase-negative phenotype but in addition, lesions were observed which showed increases rather than decreases in G6Pase activity, often with inhomogeneous staining patterns.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The fraction of G6Pase-altered tissue in liver was quantitatively evaluated and was found to range between 60 and 70% without significant difference between groups (Table I).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Therefore, if P53 has an effect on the development of liver tumors in mice, this effect does not differ between the endogenous mouse protein and its humanized P53 ortholog.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In the course of that study, Ha-Ras mutations were analyzed in parallel.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Since the emphasis of the study was on B-Raf and since no significant differences in the mutation frequencies between p53 genotypes were detectable, we did not discriminate in our previous publication between genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In Table III we now present Ha-Ras codon 61 mutation patterns of liver tumors grouped by genotype of the animals.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Point mutations in Ha-Ras codon 61 were detected in 40 to 50% of tumors without significant differences in frequencies and patterns between mice of the three genotypes.

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	112	  Mutation of P53 is often associated with nuclear accumulation of the protein.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, immunohistochemical P53 staining is a common and fast method to indirectly score for the presence of P53 mutations in tumor tissues.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In this study, we analyzed 42 liver sections stained for P53, 14 of each genotype (P53+/+, P53+/KI and P53KI/KI), for P53 accumulation in tumor transections.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Altogether 347 tumor transections could be identified, but only 4 of these showed a positive P53 staining.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Nuclear staining, often indicative of P53 mutation, was not observed in these lesions (Figure 1), of which two were from P53+/+ mice and the other two were from P53KI/KI mice.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	117	 P53-positive lesions stained also positive for glutamine synthetase, which is indicative for activation of ss-catenin by mutation of the gene (39,40) (Figure 1).

0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Note the cytoplasmic localization of P53.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	122	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   The results of our present study demonstrate that carcinogen-treated hupki mice, which harbor the human P53 sequence from exons 4 to 9 replacing the corresponding murine exons 4 to 9, show no differences in their neoplastic response in liver as compared with mice harboring the respective murine allele.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Several studies have pinpointed the fact that P53 plays a central role in tumorigenesis both in humans and in experimental systems.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	124	 For example, the gene dosage of P53 affects malignant development in murine skin and P53 null mice are highly susceptible to radiation-induced tumorigenesis (41,42).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	125	 It is also well known that heterozygous P53 null mice show an overall increase in tumor burden when compared with wild-type mice (43).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Interestingly, however, hepatocarcinogenesis was not enhanced on treatment of heterozygous P53 null mice with a chemical carcinogen (43 to 48).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	127	 These results may be interpreted in the sense that murine P53 plays an important role in the control of malignant development in some organs of mice but not in their liver, quite in contrast to human liver where the frequent inactivation of P53 in HCCs points toward an important control function of the suppressor protein during malignant transformation.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, recent data from mouse models of the Li to Fraumeni syndrome show that point mutant P53 mice develop carcinomas in a number of tissue sites, including the liver, reopening the debate on effects of P53 mutation on murine hepatooncogenesis (49).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	129	The humanized P53 protein contains several important phosphorylation sites which are possibly regulated differentially in mice and men.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The P53 proteins share a high homology between species and, although the post-transcriptional modifications of the mouse protein are not as well understood as those of the human counterpart, there is evidence that there are a number of species-specific sequence differences especially in the replaced PPD which possibly lead to a differential post-translational regulation of P53's function.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	131	Residue 72 is an important site for apoptosis and response to chemotherapy in human cells (50,51).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In humans, it is polymorphic, encoding arginine or proline, whereby the arginine variant (the more common form in Northern European populations) correlates with an enhanced response to apoptotic stimuli.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Comparing this sequence with mice is not straightforward since it lies in one of the most divergent parts of the protein [discussed in (52)], but at the corresponding position in mouse P53 (codon 69) there is an alanine.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In the hupki protein, this part of the sequence is human with an arginine at this site, but our data indicate that this does not induce a difference with respect to control of Ras-mutated cells by P53 since the prevalence of Ha-Ras mutated tumors was very similar in mice of all three P53 genotypes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	135	Serine 46 in human cells and in hupki cells (M.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	136	, unpublished data) is phosphorylated by a yet unidentified kinase after massive DNA damage (24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Substitution of serine 46 blocks the expression of P53AIP1 (P53 regulated apoptosis inducing protein 1) which is an important mediator of P53-dependent apoptosis (53).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The murine protein lacks this phosphorylation site.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Serine 46 might also provide a link of P53 to cell-cycle control since, based on sequence homologies, it could be a target for cyclin-dependent and MAP kinases in human cells (24).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Constitutive activation of MAP kinase signaling in Ras-mutated cells carrying the humanized KI alleles could therefore have a lead, by feedback inhibition, to fewer Ras-mutated tumors, an effect that was not detectable in our study.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	141	Murine threonines 76 and 86 in the PPD are expected sites of phosphorylation by MAP kinases (54,55).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Increased phosphorylation was detected after stimulation of cells with TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) (54,56).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	143	 There is no equivalent to this site in the human sequence, but again our data show that the lack of this phosphorylation site affects neither the tumor response in liver nor Ha-Ras mutation prevalence of tumors.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	144	Liver lesions of the present study stained very infrequently positive for P53 (1%).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Accumulation of P53 is a hallmark of mutation of the gene.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Nuclear P53 accumulation, however, was not observed in the positively stained lesions.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Mutation within the DNA binding domain of P53 often results in loss of the protein's ability to act as a transcription factor.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As a result Mdm2, one of its target genes, is no longer transcribed which eliminates the feedback loop that negatively controls the intracellular concentration of P53 (57).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We therefore conclude that mutation of P53 was infrequent in the mouse liver tumors, irrespective of whether the mice harbored the murine or the humanized P53 alleles.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We also found that the rare P53-positive lesions we detected were simultaneously positive for glutamine synthetase which is absent from most normal hepatocytes except those in a small ring of cells directly located around the central veins (58).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Glutamine synthetase is overexpressed in hepatoma cells with an activated version of ss-catenin and may serve as marker indicating mutation of the gene (39,40).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	152	 ss-Catenin and P53 may in fact interact: activation of ss-catenin signaling provoked by LiCl treatment of cells or by mutation of the gene leads to stabilization of P53, cell-cycle arrest, and induction of senescence in endothelial cells (59) and mouse fibroblasts (60).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We therefore suggest that the accumulation of P53 protein in glutamine synthetase-positive liver lesions of this study may be caused by the presence of an activated form of ss-catenin in cells of these lesions.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	154	The results of our present study demonstrate that hupki mice behave like P53-wild-type mice with respect to hepatocarcinogenesis induced by our DEN treatment protocol.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	155	 There was no difference in tumor response, the Ha-ras mutation prevalence of tumors was similar and there was no indication of P53 mutations in liver tumors from hupki mice, in analogy to what has been demonstrated in mice with an unmodified P53 locus (19).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	156	 These findings do not support the hypothesis that P53 harboring the human polyproline and DNA binding domains has a growth control function that is lacking in normal murine P53 of mouse hepatocytes.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	157	 We cannot exclude the possibility that the segments of murine P53 that are not replaced in the hupki model could have had an influence on the outcome of this study (Figure 2).
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Another possibility is that the hupki allele may have novel properties but nevertheless behaves like the mouse protein in the genetic environment of the mouse, either because other human-specific proteins that interact with P53 are missing or mouse-specific proteins block the control function mediated by the human allele.
0.5264005.15917304.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The reason why the mutation prevalences in Ras and in P53 in liver tumors from mice and men are so different remains to be unveiled.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	4	Precisely how mutant p53 exerts a dominant negative effect over wild type p53 has been an enigma.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To understand how wild type and mutant p53 form hetero-oligomers, we studied p53 biogenesis in vitro.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We show here that p53 dimers are formed cotranslationally (on the polysome), whereas tetramers are formed posttranslationally (by the dimerization of dimers in solution).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 therefore results in 50% of the p53 generated being heterotetramers comprised of a single species: wild type dimer/mutant dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Using hot spot mutants of p53 and a variety of natural target sites, we show that all wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest impaired DNA binding activity.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This impairment is not due to the mutant dimeric subunit inhibiting association of the complex with DNA but rather due to the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For all heterotetramers, bias in binding is particularly pronounced against those sequences in genes responsible for apoptosis rather than cell growth arrest.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results explain the molecular basis of p53 dominant negative effect and suggest a functional role in the regulation of p53 tetramerization.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	12	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	13	The importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor has been well documented.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Over half of all human cancers are mutated in the gene encoding p53, and many viruses can induce transformation of the host cell through p53 inactivation (Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Furthermore, inheriting a germline p53 mutation characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome confers a strong predisposition to cancer because 50% of those afflicted acquire cancer by age 30 (4, 5).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The role of p53 in tumorigenesis was also demonstrated in an animal tumor model, in which p53/ mice were found to be more prone to cancer development (primarily lymphomas) compared with their wild type (p53+/+) and heterozygous (p53+/) littermates (6, 7).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Loss of p53 or its function is therefore clearly linked to tumor formation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	18	As "guardian of the genome," p53 is activated by a number of genotoxic and stress signals such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (reviewed in Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Critical to the tumor-suppressing function of activated p53 is its ability to bind sequence-specific DNA sites and induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This is illustrated by the fact that most p53 mutations occur in its DNA-binding domain and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding ability (1).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Such mutations (called "hot spot" mutations) can be divided into two categories; class I mutations affect residues that make direct contact with DNA, whereas class II mutations occur at residues crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (9).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	22	The consensus p53 binding site consists of two or more copies of the 10-bp half-site 5'-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3' separated by up to 13 bp (10).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Minor variations to this consensus sequence are found in all p53 target genes.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Each half-site consists of two inverted repeat 5-bp quarter sites.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	25	 p53 binds to this consensus DNA sequence as a pair of clamps, with the two monomers within each dimer binding to two consecutive quarter sites within a half-site (11).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The two dimers within the tetramer therefore bind to the two half-sites in juxtaposition to each other, resulting in overall enhanced stability of the p53-DNA complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The lack of such cooperative binding in a single dimer-half-site interaction accounts for the drastically reduced stability of the dimer-half-site complex relative to that of the tetramer-full site complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This is also reflected by the observation that in contrast to full sites, half-sites do not confer transcriptional responsiveness to p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	29	Although there is little doubt that tumors often arise through deletion or mutation of both p53 alleles (the two-hit model) (12), there is increasing evidence that a point mutation or deletion in a single allele could result in increased susceptibility to cancer (13-17).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In cases where both mutant and wild type p53 are expressed, it has been suggested that the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild type protein, essentially rendering the latter inactive (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The end result is a drastic decrease in the level of functional p53, which in turn promotes genomic instability and cancer development.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	32	 That the mere reduction in functional p53 levels may be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis has also been recently shown in an animal tumor model in which heterozygous p53+/ mice containing a single wild type p53 allele develop tumors much earlier than those mice with two functional p53 alleles (17).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	33	The fact that many human tumors contain both a mutant and a wild type allele has led to speculations as to how mutant p53 can affect wild type p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It has been proposed (and generally believed) that in such tumors, the mutant p53 protein complexes with the wild type counterpart and drives the latter into a mutant conformation that is nonfunctional (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This model portrays mutant p53 as being dominant over wild type p53, leading to the so-called "dominant negative" effect.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Support for this model has come largely from experiments in which mutant and wild type p53 were found to be coprecipitatable when they are coexpressed (20).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	37	 More recent data suggest that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 is absolutely required for the manifestation of this dominant negative effect, because p53 mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not dominant negative and not oncogenic (21, 22).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Although it now seems clear that p53 mutants need to interact with wild type p53 to impart a dominant negative effect (23), there is no concrete evidence that this effect is the result of an induced conformational change of the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Indeed, it has been reported that mutant p53 proteins that have a wild type conformation (class I mutants) are also able to impart a dominant negative effect (24).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In corroboration with the above observation was the demonstration that the C-terminal oligomerization domain alone is sufficient to disrupt normal wild type p53 function (25, 26).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In view of the somewhat fragmentary and at times apparently contradictory information obtained thus far pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of the p53 dominant negative effect (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	42	 18 and 19), a unifying concept that can accommodate most, if not all, of the observations made to date is badly needed.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of p53 mutants in tumor development and would lead to the design of more precise and effective therapeutic measures in restoring wild type p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	44	We approached this problem by first studying the biogenesis of p53 in vitro.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We demonstrate here that dimerization of p53 occurs on the polysome (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	46	 cotranslationally), whereas tetramerization (dimer-dimer interaction) occurs in solution (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Thus, coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 results in only a single heterotetrameric species of p53 (wild type dimer/mutant dimer), representing 50% of total p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Through the use of hot spot mutants of p53 (none of which is capable of strong binding to DNA) and a variety of natural p53 target sites, we show that all heterotetramers bind poorly to these sites compared with the wild type p53 tetramer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Such impaired binding is not likely due to mutant-imposed conformational change of wild type p53 but rather is due to the lack of complementary binding by the mutant dimeric subunit (positive dimer-dimer cooperativity).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We propose this "incompetent partner" model, which reconciles a number of puzzling observations to date, as the basis of the p53 dominant negative effect.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The dominant negative effect is more pronounced with sequences linked to apoptotic response than those responsible for cell growth arrest, supporting the notion that the lack of apoptotic cell death likely plays a more important role than does loss of cell growth control in cancer development.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	91	p53 Dimerization Occurs Cotranslationally-- To gain a complete understanding of how p53 monomers reach a tetrameric state, we carried out in vitro experiments to study the biogenesis pathway of p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	92	 It was important to first determine whether p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	93	 To this end, we used transcripts of a dimeric mutant named A344 for in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	94	 This mutant contains a point mutation at residue 344 (from leucine to alanine) that disrupts the dimer-dimer interface and results in the formation of dimeric rather than tetrameric p53 (27).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We reasoned that if p53 dimerization was a posttranslational event, then the efficiency of dimer formation would be strictly dependent on the concentration of the translated A344 protein (and hence the concentration of the transcripts) in the reaction.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Conversely, the efficiency of cotranslational dimer formation (i.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	110	 A344N is derived from A344 and has a small deletion at the N terminus (residues 2-30), making it migrate faster than A344 upon SDS-PAGE.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Furthermore, because of this deletion, A344N was unable to interact with the anti-p53 antibody DO-1, which readily recognized A344 (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Because DO-1 is capable of recognizing a monomer within a dimer (see below), it was used in coprecipitation studies to see whether cotranslation of the two constructs could lead to the formation of A344/A344N heterodimers detectable by this antibody.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The results show that under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA, where the two constructs formed dimers readily (as assessed by EMSA), DO-1 precipitated A344 but not A344N (Fig.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	116	 To rule out the possibility that A344/A344N heterodimers are unstable or undetectable, we cotranslated the two transcripts at high RNA concentrations.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These species should be clearly discernible using the antibody DO-1 for supershift experiments in EMSA.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Overall, the results from the two sets of experiments involving dimeric and tetrameric constructs, respectively, are consistent with the idea that p53 biogenesis is a two-step process: cotranslational dimerization followed by posttranslational tetramerization.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	173	 On the other hand, because dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) is a posttranslational event, there is a good possibility that dimeric subunit exchange between p53 tetramers can occur with a certain degree of efficiency (30).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This is an important consideration because it would imply that an equilibrium could exist between dimers and tetramers and that external factors or parameters could influence this equilibrium and hence p53 function.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	175	To test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to confirm the relative lack of monomeric exchange between dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	176	 35S-Labeled A344 and A344N were translated separately, and cycloheximide was then added to halt further translation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Incubation was continued for an additional hour to allow time for each reaction to reach equilibrium.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The two reactions were then mixed and incubated for 2 h, after which immunoprecipitation with DO-1 was carried out to look for heterodimer formation, which would be indicative of subunit exchange.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The results showed that no A344N could be coprecipitated with A344 (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	180	 5A), suggesting that exchange of monomers between dimers did not occur.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Therefore, the cotranslational formation of p53 dimers appears to be a one-way process.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	192	 After a 2-h incubation period, there was a clear increase of heterotetramer formation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This shows that dimers within a tetramer of p53 can exchange with one another and that they are in equilibrium.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This equilibrium strongly favors tetramers over dimers because the vast majority of p53 present following translation and maturation is tetrameric (11).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Our demonstration of dimer exchange between tetramers is again congruent with the concept of p53 tetramerization being a posttranslational process involving the dimerization of dimers.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Our present demonstration that p53 tetramers are formed by posttranslational dimerization of dimers suggests that in cells (e.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Because we have recently established that the two dimers within a p53 tetramer are conformationally independent (31), it would be of interest to assess the binding of these heterotetramers to the consensus sequence (CON).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To this end, we cotranslated hp53N with five of the most common p53 mutants in human cancers (1), in addition to wild type hp53 as control.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Of the five mutants used, three are contact (class I) mutants (named H273, W248, and Q248) whose mutations lie in amino acids that directly associate with DNA, whereas two are conformational (class II) mutants (named S249 and H175) whose mutations destablilize the structure of the core domain of p53 (9).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	202	Immunoprecipitation of the cotranslation reactions with the DO-1 antibody reveals that like wild type p53, all five mutants efficiently complexed with hp53N (Fig.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In contrast, the five heterotetramers manifested significant consensus sequence binding activity, ranging from 40 to 100% that of the control (hp53)2/(hp53N)2 tetramer (Figs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Moreover, all five DNA-bound heterotetramers were stably bound, with half-lives ranging from 4.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	207	5 min (data not shown), which was significantly longer than that of a wild type dimer bound to a half-site (half-life, ~1 s) (11, 31).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Therefore, for both class I and class II mutants, the inability of the mutant dimeric subunit to bind CON does not negatively affect the capacity of the wild type dimer subunit to bind DNA.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It thus seems unlikely that in a mutant/wild type p53 heterotetramer, the mutant dimer imposes a mutant conformation upon the wild type dimer.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	224	 7 (left panels), cotranslation of hp53 and hp53N (the wild type control) generated three tetrameric species ((hp53)4, (hp53)2/(hp53N)2, and (hp53N)4), all of which bound to each of the 10 sequences in the approximate ratio of 1:2:1 (the slight variation in migration rates between target sequences was due to size (charge) differences of these sequences).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	225	 However, cotranslation of the five mutants with hp53N revealed a very different scenario.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	226	 First, none of the mutant homotetramers were capable of efficient binding to any of the target sites (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	227	 the equivalent of the uppermost band shown in the control ((hp53)4) was either weak or not present at all in the mutant/hp53N cotranslations).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This was not unexpected because all of the mutants were known class I or class II mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Second, and importantly, all five mutant p53/hp53N heterotetramers bind the 10 target sites relatively poorly compared with the wild type p53/hp53N heterotetramer, although the binding to CON was the least affected (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Reduced binding capacity of the heterotetramer was less pronounced for the mutant H273 but was clearly manifest for the other four mutants (H175, S249, Q248, and W248) (note different scales used).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	231	 We reason that the reduced binding to these natural p53 target sequences is likely due to the lack of significant input in the form of complementary (and cooperative) binding from the mutant dimeric partner.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	232	 A third interesting observation pertains to the extent of reduced binding of the heterotetramers to the different sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In particular, all of the mutant heterotetramers show drastically reduced binding to promoter sequences that govern apoptosis, namely, PIDD, IGF-BP3, and bax, compared with the other promoters, such as p21, that regulate cell cycle progression.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	244	It is generally accepted that the p53 tetramer is a dimer of dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, precisely how this comes about has been an enigma.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	246	 It has been assumed that p53 comes off the polysome as monomers, which then dimerize in solution to form dimers; dimer-dimer interaction in turn leads to the formation of tetramers (34, 35).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The present study shows that this scenario is incorrect; we demonstrate that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	248	 on the polysome), whereas tetramerization occurs posttranslationally (i.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In normal cells in which both p53 alleles are wild type, whether dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally probably has no major theoretical ramifications.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, this is not the case where the cell harbors a wild type and a mutant p53 allele.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Based on a posttranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization mechanism (the currently accepted model), wild type p53 tetramers in such cells would comprise only of total p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	252	 On the other hand, the alternative mechanism (cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization) would result in 1/4 of total p53 in these cells being wild type tetramers, a 4-fold difference that may well be sufficient to alter the fate of these cells upon exposure to genotoxic stress.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This is an important consideration in view of the recent observation that the mere reduction in p53 levels is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis (17).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Our results are compatible with the cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization model.

0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Stability of this binding is further enhanced by positive cooperative interaction between the two dimers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Panel ii, mutant p53 homotetramers are unable to bind DNA (or bind DNA very poorly) because they have mutations either in residues that make direct contact with DNA (class I mutants) or in residues that are crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (class II mutants).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Panel iii, p53 dominant negative effect: the "incompetent partner" model.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In wild type p53/mutant p53 heterotetramers, it is unlikely that the mutant dimer imposes a conformational change on the wild type dimer, which can still bind to a half-site.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The inability of the mutant dimer to "properly" bind to the other half-site and to contribute significantly to positive cooperativity results in an unstable heterotetramer-DNA complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The extent of reduced positive cooperativity varies between target sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	268	In concluding that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally, we are suggesting that neighboring nascent p53 chains on a polysome interact with each other prior to being released into the cytosol (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Such a dimerization scheme would be highly efficient because it would spare individual p53 subunits the need to search for their "partners" in a soluble pool.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Precisely how monomeric p53 nascent chains interact with each other is unclear at present.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Based on our current knowledge of the p53 dimerization domain, which is located at the C terminus of the protein (residues 323-356 (30, 36-38)), it would seem logical to deduce that interaction between neighboring chains occurs during the late stages of the translation process, close to the 3' end of the p53 transcript and just prior to release of the p53 chains from the polysome.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, one cannot rule out the possibility that interaction between neighboring nascent chains first occurs at more upstream sites, which then gives way to more a stable interaction at the C-terminal oligomerization domain as soon as this becomes feasible.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Considering the highly hydrophobic nature of the oligomerization domain (30, 36-38), cotranslational dimerization would offer an efficient means by which hydrophobic residues from neighboring chains could quickly interact such that protein misfolding would be greatly minimized.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	274	In light of the model presented for the biogenesis, it is possible that the tetramerization process could represent a form of functional regulation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Assuming that p53 is imported to the nucleus as a dimer, an attractive hypothesis would be that dimeric p53 represents a latent, inactive form of p53 requiring a signal to induce tetramerization and activation.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Then, following activation, degradation could be achieved by once again forming dimers to reveal a nuclear export sequence hidden in the tetramerization domain (34, 39, 40).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	277	 One way of accomplishing this could be through the posttranslational modification of p53.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	278	 To date, numerous posttranslational modifications have been described (reviewed in Ref.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-315 and Ser-392 have been shown to affect p53 tetramerization (41, 42).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Others have suggested potential roles for SUMOylation and ubiquitination in p53 activation and degradation by altering its oligomeric state (39, 40, 43, 44).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Further experimentation is needed to properly address this issue.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	282	Perhaps the most important conclusion from these studies pertains to the so-called p53 dominant negative effect whereby a mutant p53 protein somehow negatively affects the function of the wild type counterpart (reviewed in Refs.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Our results suggest that in cells possessing a wild type and a mutant p53 allele, there is only one type of heterotetramer produced, namely wild type dimer/mutant dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The mutant dimeric subunit within such a heterotetramer does not exert its negative effect by totally abrogating DNA binding of the complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Based on results from the present study and our previous observation that the two dimers within a tetramer are conformationally independent (31), we favor the idea that the mutant dimer does not cause a conformational change in the wild type dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Rather, the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner leads to the overall weakened DNA binding of the heterotetramer (Fig.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Because such heterotetramers bind DNA stronger than wild type dimers alone, it is likely that some cooperativity still exists and that different target sites require varying degrees of dimer-dimer cooperativity within a p53 tetramer for DNA binding.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Our model (the "incompetent partner" model) also explains why small polypeptides corresponding to the p53 oligomerization domain alone could interfere with wild type p53 function (25, 26) (because they block wild type p53 tetramerization but not dimerization) and that mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not oncogenic (22) (because they cannot interfere with wild type p53 tetramer formation).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	289	Although the present study clearly demonstrates that essentially all the wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest reduced DNA binding affinity compared with the wild type protein, the extent of this reduction varies greatly and depends on both the mutant and the target sequence.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Of the five mutants examined, H273 appears to exert the least dominant negative effect over the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	291	 For example, its presence in the heterotetramer has little or no affect on the binding of the latter to the CON or p21 sequence, whereas the other heterotetramers bind to these sequences with greatly reduced efficiency.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This could explain why, unlike other p53 mutants, ectopically expressed mutant H273 is still capable of CON-dependent transactivation (45-47).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	293	 With the other sequences, however, H273 exerts a clear dominant negative effect on the wild type protein.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	294	 But here again, this effect is not as pronounced as those manifested by the other mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It is interesting that H273, being the second most common p53 mutation in human cancer, is the least dominant negative by most accounts.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Our results indicate that mutants W248 and Q248 are the most dominant negative mutants of the five, which could in turn explain why Li-Fraumeni patients with mutations at Arg-248 rarely display loss of heterozygosity (48); apparently Arg-248 mutation in one allele is sufficient to incapacitate wild type p53 from the normal allele.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	297	Another striking observation pertains to the target sequences.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	298	 For all the five mutants used, the p21 sequence that regulates cell growth arrest is by far the least sensitive to the dominant negative effects of these mutants.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In sharp contrast, sequences that regulate apoptosis such as bax, PIDD, and IGF-BP3 all manifest very low affinity for the heterotetramers.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Additionally, we found the half-lives of the p21-heterotetramer complexes to be markedly longer (by 10-30-fold) than those of bax-, PIDD-, or IGF-BP3-heterotetramers (data not shown).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This bias was also demonstrable using wild type p53 (data not shown).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Such differential binding affinity explains recent transactivation studies showing that p53 mutants were more dominant negative for induction of apoptosis than for growth arrest in human cancer cell lines (49).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It also shows why mutants are not dominant negative in vivo when assayed for p53-dependent growth arrest (50, 51).
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	304	In summary, by studying p53 biogenesis in vitro, we demonstrate for the first time that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally, whereas dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) occurs posttranslationally.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Thus in cells possessing a wild type and mutant p53 allele, only one type of heterotetramers is present: wild type dimer-mutant dimer.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	306	 These heterotetramers manifest reduced binding affinity for all p53 target sequences tested, not because the mutant dimer necessarily imposes a mutant conformation on the wild type dimer, but because it has low affinity for DNA and therefore cannot significantly contribute to the overall stability of the p53-DNA complex.
0.5221876.11805092.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Reduced affinity was particularly marked for sequences that govern apoptosis rather than cell growth arrest, suggesting that defects in apoptotic cell death probably play an important role in cancer development in Li-Fraumeni patients.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	3	The ability of p53 to induce apoptosis requires its sequence-specific DNA binding activity; however, the transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23) can still induce apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Previously, we have shown that the region between residues 23 and 97 in p53 is necessary for such activity.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In an effort to more precisely map a domain necessary for apoptosis within the N terminus, we found that deletion of the N-terminal 23 amino acids compromises, but does not abolish, p53 induction of apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Surprisingly, p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, retains the ability to induce apoptosis to an even higher level than wild-type p53.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A more extensive deletion, which eliminates the N-terminal 63 amino acids, renders p53 completely inert in mediating apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, we found that both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate a subset of cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, we showed that residues 53 and 54 are critical for the apoptotic and transcriptional activities of both p53(1-42) and p53(Gln22-Ser23).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Taken together, these data suggest that within residues 43-63 lie an apoptotic domain as well as another transcriptional activation domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We therefore postulate that the apoptotic activity in p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42) is still transcription-dependent.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	12	    INTRODUCTION Top Abstract Introduction Procedures Results Discussion References.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	13	The p53 tumor suppressor protein serves as a checkpoint in maintaining genome stability (1-3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Several different biological responses that could play a role in maintaining genome stability have been strongly correlated with wild-type p53 function (1, 3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Following stress conditions such as in the presence of damaged DNA or insufficient growth and survival factors, the cellular levels of p53 increase.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This leads to one of at least three well understood cellular responses as follows: cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Several factors have been shown to determine how a cell responds to the accumulation of p53, e.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	18	 cell type and the presence of several cellular and viral proteins (4-8).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition, the levels of p53 in a given cell can dictate the response of the cell such that lower levels of p53 result in cell cycle arrest (9) or differentiation (10), whereas higher levels result in apoptosis (9, 10).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	20	The functional domains of p53 have been subjected to extensive analysis (1, 3, 4).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A transcriptional activation domain has been shown to lie within N-terminal residues 1-42 (11, 12).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Within this region there are a number of acidic and hydrophobic residues, characteristics of the acidic activator family of transcriptional factors (13).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Indeed, a double point mutation of the two hydrophobic amino acids at residues 22 and 23 renders p53 transcriptionally inactive (14).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These two residues presumably are required for the interaction of the activation domain with the TATA box binding protein and/or TATA box binding protein-associated factors (15-18).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	25	It is well established that as a transcriptional activator, p53 up-regulates p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (19-21), which leads to p53-dependent G1 arrest.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, it is not certain what function(s) of p53 is required for apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The transactivation function of p53 was shown to be required in some experimental protocols (22-24).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	28	 There are several candidate genes that play roles in apoptosis that can be activated in response to p53 induction, such as BAX (25), IGFBP3 (26), PAG608 (27), KILLER/DR5 (28), and several redox-related PIGs genes (29).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Several other studies, including our own observations, have provided evidence that p53 might have a transcription-independent function in apoptosis (9, 30-32).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recently, the proline-rich region between residues 60 and 90, which comprises five "PXXP" motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid), was found to be necessary for efficient growth suppression (33) and apoptosis (34) and to serve as a docking site for transactivation-independent growth arrest induced by GAS1 (35).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	31	Previously, we showed that the region between residues 23 and 97 is necessary for apoptosis (9).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To more precisely map such a domain in the N terminus necessary for apoptosis, we have made several new mutants.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Analyses of these mutants lead to identification of a novel domain between residues 43 and 63 that can mediate apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We also found that a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes both the transcriptional and apoptotic activities mediated by this novel domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, we hypothesize that a transcriptional activity located in this novel domain regulates a subset of cellular p53 targets that are responsible for apoptosis.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	83	A Novel Domain within Residues 43-63 Is Necessary for Mediating Apoptosis-- Previously, we showed that p53(1-22), which lacks the N-terminal 22 amino acids, can still induce apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest (9).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Since both residues 22 and 23 are critical for p53 transcriptional activity (14), we decided to determine whether p53(1-23), which deletes the N-terminal 23 amino acids, would also be able to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	85	We have previously established a cell line that expresses high levels of wild-type p53 called p53-3 (9).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	86	 This line was established using a tetracycline-regulated expression system as described previously (42).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	87	 By using similar techniques, we established nine stable cell lines that express p53(1-23).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Three representative cell lines, p53(1-23)-9, -10, and -23, are shown in Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Western blot analysis showed that these cell lines express p53(1-23) at levels comparable to wild-type p53 in p53-3 cells (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To characterize p53(1-23), we looked at its transcriptional and apoptotic activities and the growth rate of the cell line p53(1-23)-9.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The transcriptional activity was determined by monitoring the expression of the endogenous gene, p21, a well defined transcriptional target of p53 (19).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We found that p53(1-23) is still capable of activating p21, albeit to a much less degree than wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Next, the growth rates of p53(1-23)-9 cells under both uninduced and induced conditions were determined, and these cells failed to multiply following p53 expression (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To exclude potential effects of the regulator tetracycline and/or the tet-vp16 transactivator (42) on cell growth, we analyzed the growth rate of the cell line H24-1, which was similarly established but did not express any protein.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The results showed that the growth rates of H24-1 cells under both the uninduced (+tet) and induced (tet) conditions were nearly identical (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	96	 1C), indicating that both tetracycline and tet-vp16 transactivator have no effect on cell growth.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	97	 It is well established that the percentage of cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content reflects the extent to which cells are undergoing apoptosis (9, 23, 31).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Since p53 can induce apoptosis in H1299 cells (9, 31), FACS analysis was used to observe the extent of apoptosis by determining the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The results showed that 18% of cells expressing p53(1-23) had a sub-G1 DNA content 3 days after induction of this mutant, compared with less than 5% of the same cells expressing no p53 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Trypan blue exclusion assay showed that 15% of cells were dead, which is consistent with FACS analysis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In contrast, about 45 and 30% of cells had a sub-G1 DNA content at day 3 following expression of either wild-type p53 or transactivation-deficient p53(Gln22-Ser23), respectively (Table I).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The FACS results also showed that the number of cells in S phase was decreased from 38 to 22.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	167	The above observations raise the following question: why does p53(Gln22-Ser23) fail to activate these well-defined p53 transcriptional targets (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	168	 4A; Table II) despite the fact that it still contains an intact activation domain II? One of the possibilities is that p53(Gln22-Ser23) might be still able to activate a subset of p53 transcriptional targets which have yet been identified.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	169	 To this end, we tested the expression patterns of several potential p53 targets identified in our laboratory.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	170	 We found that one putative p53 transcriptional target, MCG14, was activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) to a level comparable to that by wild-type p53, p53(1-42), p53(64-91), and p53(364-393) (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	171	Since a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23 abolishes the transcriptional activity of the activation domain I (14), we looked for analogous hydrophobic amino acids within the activation domain II.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Two were found: tryptophan at residue 53 and phenylalanine at residue 54.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	173	 We therefore made identical mutations in these two amino acids in p53(Gln22-Ser23) or p53(1-42), changing tryptophan 53 to glutamine and phenylalanine 54 to serine to generate p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We then established a number of cell lines that inducibly express these mutants, and their ability to induce apoptosis and activate cellular p53 targets were similarly analyzed as above.

0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	190	The p53 protein has been divided into several functional domains (1, 3, 4) as follows: (a) an activation domain which lies within residues 1-42 that has been shown to be required for both transcriptional activation and repression (11, 12, 14, 44); (b) a newly identified proline-rich domain within residues 64-91 which is necessary for efficient growth suppression (33), apoptosis (34), and for mediating GAS1-dependent growth arrest (35); (c) a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain which lies within the central, conserved portion of the protein (1, 3); (d) a nuclear localization signal which lies within residues 316-325 (1, 3); (e) a tetramerization domain which lies within residues 334-356 (1, 3); and (f) a C-terminal basic domain which binds DNA nonspecifically and regulates the sequence-specific DNA binding activity (1, 3).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	191	Here we found that within residues 43-63 lies another novel domain that is necessary for apoptosis on the basis of the following observations: (i) p53(1-42), which lacks the N-terminal 42 amino acids and the previously defined activation domain, contains a strong apoptotic activity; (ii) p53(1-63), which lacks the N-terminal 63 amino acids but contains intact PXXP motifs, has no apoptotic activity; (iii) a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 renders both p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) completely inert in inducing apoptosis; and (iv) codon 53 is one of the frequently mutated sites outside the DNA binding domain in the p53 gene in human tumors (45), which underscores the importance of the apoptotic function within residues 43-63 in p53 tumor suppression.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	192	How does this novel domain mediate an apoptotic activity? Previously, it was shown that p53(Gln22-Ser23), which cannot activate several cellular p53 targets (9, 14, 22, 31, 43), is still capable of inducing apoptosis (9, 31, 34), and a p53 mutant, which lacks the proline-rich region, is capable of activating several p53 targets (33, 34) but cannot induce apoptosis (33, 34).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These results lead to a hypothesis that p53 has both transcription-dependent and -independent functions in apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, it is well established that p53 mutants that are defective in sequence-specific DNA binding activity are also inert in inducing apoptosis (1, 3, 4), suggesting that p53 sequence-specific DNA binding activity and possibly its sequence-specific transcriptional activity are required for inducing apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Here we found that p53(1-42), which lacks the entire previously defined activation domain I, not only induces apoptosis, but also activates the MDM2, BAX, and GADD45 genes through its activation domain II located between residues 43 and 63 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Since p53(Gln22-Ser23) contains an intact activation domain II, we hypothesized that it might still contain transcriptional activity.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Indeed, we found that p53(Gln22-Ser23) can activate one of the putative p53 targets, MCG14.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Furthermore, a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 completely abolishes the ability of both p53(Gln22-Ser23/Gln53-Ser54) and p53(1-42/Gln53-Ser54) to activate MCG14 and induce apoptosis.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Consistent with our results, Candau et al.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	200	 (46) recently showed that within residues 40-83 lies a sub-activation domain, which can activate a reporter gene under control of a promoter with a p53-responsive element when p53 is cotransfected, and a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 also abolished the transcriptional activity of the sub-activation domain.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These results suggest that p53 has two independent activation domains.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	202	 A second activation domain within a transcription factor is not without precedent.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Herpes simplex virus protein VP16 also contains two independent activation domains (47).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Thus, it appears that in response to various stress conditions and their subsequent modifications, the two independent activation domains might serve as an intrinsic factor of p53 that determines whether a given p53 target is activated.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Although BAX, MDM2, and GADD45 are the activation domain II-regulated gene products, these cellular p53 targets might not mediate the p53-dependent apoptosis on the basis of two observations: (i) these genes were not activated by p53(Gln22-Ser23) which is competent in inducing apoptosis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	206	 4A; Table II); (ii) these genes were activated by p53(62-91) which is defective in inducing apoptosis (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Since cell type has been shown to influence the cellular response (cell cycle arrest or apoptosis) to p53 (1, 4, 8), cellular genetic background might then determine the modification of the two activation domains.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Therefore, the results obtained in H1299 cells need to be confirmed in other cell types.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	209	It is intriguing that although p53(Gln22-Ser23) contains an intact activation domain II, it fails to activate BAX, GADD45, and MDM2 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Since both p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) can activate these p53 targets, it suggests that the presence of the first 23 amino acids may mask the ability of the activation domain II in p53(Gln22-Ser23) to activate these cellular p53 targets.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Alternatively, it is also possible that when the activation domain I is inactivated by a double point mutation at residues 22 and 23, the N-terminal 42 residues might then inhibit or block interaction of a co-activator (or an adaptor) with the activation domain II that is required for activation of some p53 targets, such as MDM2, p21, BAX, and GADD45, but not for activation of other p53 targets, such as MCG14.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	212	 It is important to note that although the activation domain I is primarily responsible for activation of p21, the level of p21 in cells expressing either p53(1-23) and p53(1-42) was slightly increased upon p53 induction (Figs.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	213	 1A and 2A), suggesting that the activation domain II can weakly activate p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Furthermore, our preliminary studies showed that activation of p21 was compromised by a double point mutation at residues 53 and 54 when p53(Gln53-Ser54) was expressed at a low to intermediate level,3 consistent with the idea that the activation domain II contributes to the activation of p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Since several clones that express various expression levels of the target genes are required for determining the function of the targets (48), these results remain to be confirmed.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	216	Previously, it was shown that overexpression of p21 can protect human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells from prostaglandin A2-mediated apoptosis (49).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Lack of p21 expression due to homologous deletion of the p21 gene also renders HCT116 colorectal cancer cells susceptible to apoptosis following treatment with either -radiation or chemotherapeutic agents (50).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	218	 In addition, a significant fraction of tumors in mice deriving from p21/ HCT116 cancer cells were completely cured, and all tumors deriving from p21+/+ cancer cells underwent regrowth after treatment with -radiation (50).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	219	 It is interesting to note that p53(Gln22-Ser23) and p53(1-42), both of which lack a functional activation domain I, cannot significantly activate p21 (Fig.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	220	 2 and 4; Table II) but can induce apoptosis (Table I).
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The strong apoptotic activity conferred by p53(1-42) might be due to its failure of activating p21.
0.5739836.9582339.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Thus, we have generated a mutant, p53(1-42), that might be better than wild-type p53 in the elimination of cancer cells and therefore a potential candidate for gene therapy.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   hGTSE-1 (human G2 and S phase-expressed-1) is a cell cycle-regulated protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm and apparently associated with the microtubules.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	4	 hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate levels and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein: it binds the C-terminal region of p53 and represses its ability to induce apoptosis after DNA damage.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here we report that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 becomes stabilized in a p53-independent way and accumulated in the nucleus.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Further characterization of hGTSE-1 localization revealed increased nuclear staining in unstressed cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, or when a nuclear export signal (NES) located in its C-terminal region was mutated.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Finally, we provide evidence that hGTSE-1 ectopic expression, in addition to p53 protein levels down-regulation, is able to enhance cytoplasmic localization of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Interestingly, NES-mutated hGTSE-1 accumulates in the nucleus, binds p53 but looses its ability to enhance cytoplasmic redistribution of p53 and to regulate p53 protein levels.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Similarly, when wild type hGTSE-1 functions on p53 were analyzed in cells lacking Mdm2, it failed in regulating both p53 localization and protein levels, thus indicating that hGTSE-1 requires an intact NES and functional Mdm2 for the regulation of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of hGTSE-1 function, whereby its characterized nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling ability is required to regulate p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53-mediated response pathway is among the most frequent targets of inactivation in human cancers.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The tumor-suppressor p53 protein is a nuclear transcription factor that transactivates a variety of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis (1).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Failure of p53 function can be attributed to the following: (a) inactivation of p53 by mutations altering its DNA binding capability (2), (b) deregulation of proteins that control p53 levels or activity (i.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	14	 cellular or viral oncogenes) (3-5), and (c) nuclear exclusion that interferes with its role as transcription factor (6).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	15	Regulation of WT-p53 protein is based on a strict physiological turnover including ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 depends on nuclear export signals (NES)1 and nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) located in the N and C termini of the protein (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The main regulator of p53 is Mdm2, which interacts with the N-terminal of p53 thus blocking p53 transcriptional activation and promoting its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 seems to be essential for its degradation by Mdm2 (9, 10).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Mdm2 expression is a key factor that efficiently promotes nuclear export of p53 (11, 12).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Important stimuli leading to p53 activation and stabilization such as DNA damage, which causes phosphorylation of the N-terminal NES (13), or p14ARF expression, which interferes with Mdm2 activity (14), efficiently inhibit p53 nuclear exclusion.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	21	 On the contrary, proteins like E1B55k (15), Mot-2 (16), Parc (17), or PSF-TFE3 (18) are able to down-regulate or destabilize p53 by cytoplasmic sequestration, thus emphasizing the importance of p53 relocalization as an effective means to control its function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	22	The C-terminal domain of p53 has been characterized as a key domain involved in the control of p53 localization (19, 20).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Three NLSs and one NES are located within amino acids 316 and 384 of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It has been proposed that p53 localization is mainly regulated by the NES masking/NES exposition switch (21).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mdm2-driven ubiquitination or certain mutations of the p53 C-terminal region enhance p53 relocalization to the cytoplasm (22, 23).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	26	Mouse GTSE-1 (G2 and S phase-expressed), previously named B99, is a cell cycle-regulated protein that mainly localizes to the microtubules and is induced by WT-p53 upon DNA damage (24, 25).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We have recently shown that its human homologue, hGTSE-1 (26), is able to control DNA damage-induced apoptosis by down-regulating p53 function (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	28	 hGTSE-1 binds the C-terminal domain of p53 (355-393) and induces down-regulation of p53 levels and activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Although hGTSE-1 binding to p53 seems to be required for repressing p53 activity, it is unclear how hGTSE-1 regulates p53 stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	30	Here we report that hGTSE-1 protein accumulates after DNA damage through a p53-independent mechanism concomitant with its relocalization from cytoplasm to the nucleus.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	31	 By studying hGTSE-1 subcellular localization we found that it is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein containing an active NES in its C-terminal region.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We also demonstrate that in addition to decreasing p53 levels, hGTSE-1 expression promotes p53 localization to the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, we show that shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 as well as Mdm2 are both required for the regulation of p53 localization and levels.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Nevertheless, similarly to other p53 target genes, mouse GTSE-1 is also induced by DNA damage in cells lacking functional p53 (24).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	66	To characterize the p53-dependent regulation of hGTSE-1 protein, we used human cell lines expressing a temperature-sensitive p53 allele (TS-p53), with a mutant conformation at 37  degrees C and a WT conformation at 32  degrees C.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	67	 1A, no differences in hGTSE-1 protein levels were observed between WT or mutant p53 conformations, indicating that the expression of hGTSE-1 protein is not induced by WT-p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This observation is supported by the fact that p53 failed to increase hGTSE-1 mRNA levels in Northern blot analysis in the same cellular system (data not shown).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Furthermore, analysis of p53 response in this context showed that hGTSE-1 becomes accumulated with a slower kinetic compared with both p53 and the p53-induced protein p21Waf-1 (32), detected 3 and 6-9 h after ET treatment, respectively, indicating that hGTSE-1 increases in a late phase after DNA damage.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	81	By analyzing hGTSE-1 intracellular localization we observed that, similar to the murine protein, hGTSE-1 is a cytoplasmic protein localized to the microtubules (26).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Overexpression of hGTSE-1, however, revealed a small subpopulation of cells that, in addition to cytoplasmic staining, displayed nuclear staining (data not shown).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	110	 We generated human and mouse GTSE-1 constructs with a double-point mutation within the putative NES (hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES-, respectively) by changing isoleucine 628 and leucine 630 to alanine in hGTSE-1, and leucines 648 and 650 to alanine in GTSE-1 as indicated in Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	111	 hGTSE-1 NES- and GTSE-1 NES- constructs were transfected in U2OS cells and 24 h later their localizations were assessed by immunofluorescence.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	112	 3C, both NES mutants displayed an enhanced nuclear localization, thus identifying the presence of an active NES within GTSE-1 proteins.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	113	 This result is in accordance with the enhanced nuclear localization of hGTSE-1 and GTSE-1 observed after LMB treatment, because such a drug inhibits nuclear export pathways that require the CRM1 receptor for leucine-rich NESs (34-36).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Accumulation of GTSE-1 proteins to the nucleus could imply another control at the level of nuclear entry, in addition to the described regulation of nuclear export.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Finally, we investigated whether down-regulation of p53 levels by hGTSE-1 required proteasome activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Experiments were performed by adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to cells transfected in parallel to those shown in the left panel of Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Cells were treated with MG132 during the last 8 h before lysis.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	179	 5E (right panel), inhibition of proteasome abolished p53 down-regulation by WT hGTSE-1, indicating that proteasome activity is required for the control of p53 stability by hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	180	Functional Mdm2 Is Required for hGTSE-1-dependent p53 Nuclear Export The obtained results suggest that hGTSE-1 is able to down-regulate p53 protein levels by a mechanism involving p53 cytoplasmic relocalization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Mdm2 is the major regulator of p53 (4, 5) and strongly promotes p53 nuclear exclusion (11, 12).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	182	 For this reason we next analyzed the requirement of Mdm2 in the hGTSE-1-dependent regulation of p53 subcellular localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	183	Our first approach was to analyze the effect of hGTSE-1 in the subcellular localization of GFP-p53 in Mdm2-deficient cells (MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/-).

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	187	 6A, hGTSE-1 expression failed to promote p53 cytoplasmic localization in Mdm2-deficient cells.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Moreover, the effect of hGTSE-1 on p53 nuclear export was partially rescued by Mdm2 expression, thus indicating that the effect of hGTSE-1 on p53 nuclear export requires functional Mdm2 (Fig.

0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	206	Finally, by using MEF p53-/-, Mdm2-/-, where hGTSE-1 fails in relocalizing p53 to the cytoplasm, we investigated whether hGTSE-1 could affect p53 stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	207	 To this purpose cells were transfected with vectors expressing WT or NES- hGTSE-1 and p53, together with an empty GFP vector used as transfection control as performed in Fig.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Western blot analysis indicated that hGTSE-1 did not markedly affect p53 stability, suggesting that hGTSE-1 could regulate p53 levels by enhancing its cytoplasmic relocalization through an Mdm2-dependent mechanism.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	209	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Here we present new insights on the function of hGTSE-1, which we have recently characterized as a negative regulator of p53 (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	210	 We provide evidence that hGTSE-1 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein that becomes stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage, independently of p53 status.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	211	 We show that hGTSE-1 nuclear export depends on a C-terminal NES that, when mutated, increases its nuclear localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Interestingly, hGTSE-1 overexpression enhances cytoplasmic localization of p53, requiring an intact NES and functional Mdm2 to efficiently exert this function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	213	In unstressed cells, a number of positive and negative regulators maintain the steady-state level of p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Under stress conditions, p53 is activated by a variety of post-translational modifications that altogether lead to its rapid stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These modifications are usually necessary for the association of p53 with factors involved in its stabilization and activation, such as Pin-1 (40) and/or for dissociation from factors that negatively regulate p53, like Mdm2 or JNK (41, 42).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	216	 On the contrary, during post-damage recovery, negative regulators play a critical role in down-regulating p53 levels and activity to restore its steady-state function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	217	 It can be hypothesized that such a recovery phase requests for other regulators, like hGTSE-1, in addition to the most established ones.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	218	In this report we show that hGTSE-1 protein levels increase in response to several DNA-damaging agents.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Because we have recently demonstrated that hGTSE-1 expression attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by controlling p53 function (27), increased levels of hGTSE-1 protein after DNA damage may be involved in negative feedback regulation of the p53 signaling pathway.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Consistent with this model, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of hGTSE-1 sensitizes cells to p53-dependent apoptosis upon DNA damage (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Thus, hGTSE-1 may play an important role in DNA damage response, by preventing prolonged p53 activation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Further analysis of the behavior of hGTSE-1 allowed us to show that, after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 is clearly relocalized from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Time course experiments performed to dissect the kinetics of hGTSE-1 enhanced expression and nuclear accumulation after DNA damage, indicate that both occur with a slower rate when compared with p53 stabilization, activation, and p21Waf-1 induction.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This observation could imply that, at early time points after DNA damage, hGTSE-1 should not interfere with the p53 response, rather, it could play a critical role in controlling a later phase in the p53 response, most likely in the post-damage recovery phase.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	225	We show that hGTSE-1 actively shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as evidenced by the nuclear export inhibitor LMB, which caused clear nuclear accumulation of hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Furthermore, mutation of the C-terminal NES (hGTSE-1 NES-) enhanced hGTSE-1 nuclear localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	227	Shuttling activity of hGTSE-1 therefore emerged as a potentially critical mechanism for controlling p53 localization and stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In line with this hypothesis, coexpression of hGTSE-1 and p53 (used as GFP-tagged protein) resulted in increased cytoplasmic distribution of p53 when compared with localization of p53 alone.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	229	 hGTSE-1 is known to interact with p53 in a region mapped between amino acids 355 and 393 (27), where two NLS are located (7).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of lysine residues found within these NLSs results in enhanced cytoplasmic localization of p53 (23), suggesting that modification to this region could lead to p53 nuclear export.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In this context, physical interaction of hGTSE-1 with p53 could affect this region, enhancing p53 cytoplasmic localization.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Importantly, hGTSE-1 shuttling activity is required to promote p53 localization to the cytoplasm.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Our results clearly demonstrate that NES defective hGTSE-1 failed in enhancing p53 distribution to the cytoplasm, although its ability to associate p53 was comparable with WT hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	234	 It is therefore conceivable that cytoplasmic redistribution of p53, as enhanced by hGTSE-1, is not merely because of alterations or modifications of the C-terminal domain of p53 caused by this interaction, rather, our data also indicate the requirement of hGTSE-1 shuttling activity.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Interestingly, Mdm2, known to efficiently promote p53 nuclear exclusion (11, 12) is also required for the hGTSE-1 effect on p53 localization, because we observed that hGTSE-1 WT shows an impaired ability in relocalizing p53 in Mdm2-deficient cells.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	236	Similarly to that observed for p53 relocalization, an intact NES and functional Mdm2 seem to be required by hGTSE-1 in regulation of p53 protein levels, indicating a relationship between the ability of hGTSE-1 to relocalize p53 to the cytoplasm and to regulate its stability.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Moreover, inhibition of proteasome activity prevents p53 protein down-regulation by hGTSE-1 expression, indicating that cytoplasmic localization of p53 could be accompanied by proteasome-dependent degradation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The Mdm2 ring finger domain and its ability to ubiquitinate p53 have been shown to be critical in promoting p53 nuclear export (11, 12) and degradation in the cytoplasm (10, 38).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The possibility that hGTSE-1 could promote p53 nuclear export by enhancing Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 does not seem to be consistent with our data, because no detectable increase in p53 ubiquitination was observed in the in vivo ubiquitination assay (data not shown).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	240	 We thus favor the hypothesis that hGTSE-1 accelerates the p53 nuclear export process after Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	241	Nuclear accumulated hGTSE-1 looses its ability to regulate both localization and levels of p53, as demonstrated using NES defective hGTSE-1.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Therefore, we could hypothesize that nuclear accumulation of hGTSE-1, in response to DNA damage, could be because of the phosphorylation-dependent mechanism-inactivating NES function.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Subsequently, in the post-damage recovery phase, reactivation of hGTSE-1 NES activity through dephosphorylation could be required for the efficient regulatory function of hGTSE-1 on p53.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	244	It is conceivable that a similar function of hGTSE-1 takes place in unstressed cells during the cell cycle, because we have shown that it can control basal p53 levels preferentially during the S and G2 phases (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Moreover, p53 localization was reported to change during the cell cycle, with increased cytoplasmic distribution during S and G2 (43, 44), coincident with hGTSE-1 highest expression.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Together these data could suggest a physiological function of hGTSE-1 in regulating p53 stability and nuclear exclusion of p53 in unstressed cells, possibly during specific phases of the cell cycle that require additional and more stringent negative regulators.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	247	Our results indicate that after DNA damage hGTSE-1 is stabilized independently of p53 status, suggesting that in response to damage, hGTSE-1 could play specific functions in parallel to that involving p53 regulation.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In fact, the ability of hGTSE-1 to regulate the cell cycle progression is p53 independent (27).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Other proteins such as JNK (42), Pin-1 (40), or p38 kinase (45) play a role in p53 signaling although their regulation does not depend on p53, thus suggesting that p53 function is tightly controlled by independent signaling pathways.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	250	We present here a possible mechanism by which hGTSE-1 can regulate p53 after DNA damage, highlighting the relevance of its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling activity and functional requirement of Mdm2.
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	251	 hGTSE-1, like its mouse homologue GTSE-1, is a cell cycle-regulated protein that maintains its S- and G2-specific expression even when induced by DNA-damaging agents (25).
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We therefore propose a role of hGTSE-1 as part of a negative feedback loop involved in the control of DNA damage and during specific phases of the cell cycle that require more effective means to down-regulate p53 activity and levels.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, September 7, 2004 , and in revised form, October 4, 2004.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor is a key mediator of the cellular response to stress.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Phosphorylation induced by multiple stress-activated kinases has been proposed to be essential for p53 stabilization, interaction with transcriptional co-activators, and activation of p53 target genes.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, genetic studies suggest that stress-activated phosphorylation may not be essential for p53 activation.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We therefore investigated the role of p53 phosphorylation on six key serine residues (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392) for p53 activation using nutlin-3, a recently developed small molecule MDM2 antagonist.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We show here that nutlin does not induce the phosphorylation of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Comparison of the activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide in HCT116 and RKO cells revealed no difference in their sequence-specific DNA binding and ability to transactivate p53 target genes and to induce p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We conclude that p53 phosphorylation on six major serine sites is not required for activation of p53 target genes or biological responses in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates a complex network of cellular proteins evolved to protect cells from malignant transformation (1, 2).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In response to diverse stress factors, p53 induces the expression of different subsets of genes leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, or senescence.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In cells that are not under stress, p53 activation could suppress their growth or induce apoptosis were it not for the tight regulation elicited by MDM2 (3, 4).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The MDM2 gene expression is regulated in part by a p53-responsive promoter.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In turn, MDM2 protein binds the p53 N-terminal transactivation domain and negatively regulates tumor suppressor function by compromising transcriptional regulation.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Additionally, as MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 and itself, MDM2 controls p53 half-life via ubiquitin-dependent degradation.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This negative feedback control mechanism assures that both p53 and MDM2 proteins are kept at very low levels in proliferating cells (4).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	18	In response to stress, the p53-MDM2 interaction must be disrupted to enable p53 to associate with factors needed for activation of its target genes.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Stress-induced p53 activation involves post-translational modification of p53 on multiple sites by phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation (2, 5) and modifications to MDM2 that can enhance MDM2 autoubiquitination and degradation (6).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	20	 With regard to p53 modifications, phosphorylation has been studied most intensively and has been proposed to play a critical role in the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These studies have been greatly facilitated by the availability of antibodies that recognize p53 modified on specific phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (for review, see Ref.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Multiple serine (6, 9, 15, 20, 33, 37, 46, 315, 371, 376, 378, and 392) and three threonine residues (18, 55, and 81) have been reported to undergo phosphorylation in response to diverse stresses.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Multiple serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in the upstream signaling leading to p53 phosphorylation (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, CK1, p38, CDK2, PKC, JNK), but the precise mechanism of this signaling and its regulation are not well understood (8, 9).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Residues from the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain of p53 (Ser20 and Thr18) have been shown to play a critical role in the interaction between the two proteins and their stress-induced phosphorylation decreases substantially the affinity between p53 and MDM2 when analyzed in vitro using peptide substrates (10 to 12).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These and other studies (7, 13) have led to the conclusion that phosphorylation of p53 is a key mechanism responsible for activation of the tumor suppressor in response to cellular stress.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	26	In addition to its proposed role in abrogation of p53-MDM2 binding and stabilization of the protein, p53 phosphorylation has also been implicated in regulation of its activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, this aspect of p53 phosphorylation is still poorly understood and controversial.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Transcriptional activity of p53 is of principal importance for its function as a tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It has been suggested that phosphorylation at specific residues can affect the transcriptional activity of p53 and/or its selectivity toward different subset of genes thus determining the specific type of cellular response to stress (5, 8).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Activity of p53 as a transcription factor may be influenced by several factors: (a) ability to form active tetramers, (b) sequence-specific DNA binding, and (c) interaction with other components of the transcriptional machinery.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It has been reported that Ser315 and Ser392 phosphorylation may regulate the oligomerization of p53 and thus its sequence-specific DNA binding (14 to 16).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Ser15 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance the interaction of p53 with transcriptional co-activators CBP and PCAF (10, 17 to 19).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser46 has been implicated in the activation of p53-dependent apoptotic response (20, 21).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recently, prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been reported to bind p53 and enhance its DNA binding and transcriptional activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This binding is dependent on DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 (22, 23).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 phosphorylation may play an important role not only in stabilization of p53 but also in modulation of its transcriptional activity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	37	 On the other hand, experiments in which almost all phosphorylation sites in p53 have been mutated demonstrated that transiently expressed phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p53 do not differ significantly in their stability or ability to transactivate reporter genes in p53-null cells (24).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Furthermore, studies using mouse mutants with substitutions of Ser15 or Ser20 suggest that these residues are not essential for p53 activation (25 to 27).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	39	Recently, we reported the identification of the first potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction, the nutlins (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53 binding pocket with high selectivity and can release p53 from negative control leading to effective stabilization of p53 and activation of the p53 pathway in vitro and in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Nutlins are non-genotoxic and activate p53 by preventing it from binding to MDM2 (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	42	 They do not bind to p53 protein and do not interfere with its activities.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Treatment of cultured cells with MDM2 antagonists cause accumulation of p53 protein that is free of phosphorylation on Ser15 (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Therefore, nutlins may represent valuable molecular tools for studying the role of p53 phosphorylation in its natural cellular context.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Here, we show that p53 induced by the MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3, is not phosphorylated on six key serine residues.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Despite the lack of detectable phosphorylation, nutlin-induced p53 showed equal or better sequence-specific DNA binding, ability to transactivate p53 target genes, and p53-dependent apoptotic activity than phosphorylated p53 induced by the genotoxic drugs doxorubicin and etoposide.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Our results provide further support to the notion that separating MDM2 from p53 is an important step in p53 activation, but phosphorylation is not required for execution of p53 biological functions.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	83	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   MDM2 Antagonists Stabilize p53 and Activate p53 Target Genes Recently, we developed a class of potent and selective inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interaction (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These compounds, called nutlins, bind MDM2 at the p53 pocket with high specificity and can displace p53 from its complex with its negative regulator.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Treatment of cells encoding wild-type p53 with nutlins leads to p53 stabilization, accumulation, and activation of the p53 pathway.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	86	 As nutlins activate p53 by preventing its physical interaction with MDM2, they should not alter the post-translational modification status of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consequently, they represent valuable molecular probes to study the contributions of post-translational modifications to p53 function.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	88	Using the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3, we aimed at studying the functional activity of unmodified p53 compared with the activity of p53 modified in response to treating cells with the genotoxic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	89	 We chose the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and RKO as they possess wild-type p53 and respond to genotoxic stress by p53 stabilization and activation of the p53 pathway (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To find the optimal treatment condition, we incubated exponentially growing cells with a range of concentrations of etoposide, doxorubicin, and the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 (nutlin-3a) for 24 h.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	91	 These ranges included the IC50 and IC90 values previously determined by a proliferation/viability assay (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Western analysis of the cell lysates from both cells lines revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of p53 and its target gene products MDM2 and p21Waf1/CIP1 (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The observed decrease in the MDM2 and p21 level at the high doxorubicin concentrations is most likely due to protein degradation in cells undergoing apoptosis.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Our data demonstrate that unphosphorylated p53 is fully capable of activating downstream signaling in the p53 pathway equivalent to phosphorylated p53.

0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This conclusion is compatible with recent studies showing that drugs such as leptomycin B also activate p53 in the absence of serine 15 phosphorylation (6, 40).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	215	Nutlin-treated HCT116 and RKO cells accumulated p53 protein at levels comparable with those levels induced by two genotoxic drugs, doxorubicin and etoposide (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, as predicted by the mechanism of action, p53 induced by interference with p53-MDM2 binding did not show detectable phosphorylation on six serine residues previously reported as major phosphorylation sites (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	217	 At the same time, p53 was phosphorylated on all six serine residues in doxorubicin-treated cells (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Etoposide-induced p53 showed a comparable level of phosphorylation on some serine residues but much weaker to undetectable on others, reflecting differences in the upstream signaling by these drugs (41).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The fact that nutlin-induced p53 is not phosphorylated on six highly conserved phosphorylation sites makes it unlikely that other potential sites could be phosphorylated by MDM2 antagonists.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that p53 stabilized by nutlin-3 is free of phosphorylation and perhaps from other post-translational modifications.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	221	Nutlin-induced p53 in HCT116 and RKO cells showed comparable binding activity to its consensus DNA sequence indicating an equivalent transactivation potential (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	222	 However, transactivation properties depend on multiple factors and are best measured on native p53-regulated genes in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	223	 To this end, we examined the activation of three different p53 target genes by quantitative PCR.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	224	 All three have been reported as immediate downstream genes directly regulated by p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This test revealed that unphosphorylated nutlin-induced p53 had equal or superior activity (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Together with the previous result, this experiment confirmed that the phosphorylation status does not confer to p53 higher transactivation potency.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	227	 On the contrary, it appears that unphosphorylated p53 is an equivalent or possibly better activator of all three genes in both cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Only MIC-1 is activated slightly higher by doxorubicin in RKO cells.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	229	Although we did not see effects of p53 phosphorylation on the transcriptional activity of p53 on three genes in two cell lines, we cannot exclude the possibility that differences might be detected in the large constellation of p53 regulated genes or under specific conditions in specific tissues or cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, the results from a recent study published during the preparation of our manuscript render this possibility unlikely.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	231	 (42) have used isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced p14ARF as a means to sequester MDM2 and stabilize p53 in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	232	 ARF-induced p53 has been found phosphorylation-free on five N-terminal serine residues (Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, and Ser37) but still phosphorylated on the C-terminal Ser392.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Comparison of the global gene expression activated by this partially phosphorylated p53 with fully phosphorylated doxorubicin-induced p53 by DNA array analysis revealed that most genes are up-regulated similarly.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These authors concluded that N-terminal phosphorylation is not required for transcriptional activation of most p53 target genes.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The data from this and our study derived by different tools in different cell systems support the conclusion that p53 phosphorylation is dispensable for transcriptional activation of p53-regulated genes in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	236	It has been established that p53 functions primarily as a transcription factor that regulates multiple genes involved in regulation of cell growth and homeostasis.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, transcription-independent p53 functions have also been reported to mediate apoptosis under some experimental conditions (36, 37).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	238	 p53 can bind directly to mitochondrial proteins and induce apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner (43).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Apoptotic activity of p53 is the most complex and least understood of its functions.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	240	 There are multiple and frequently overlapping apoptotic pathways downstream of p53, and studying one or several of them may not be of significant value.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Fortunately, all apoptotic pathways converge at the point of irreversible commitment to apoptosis.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This can be quantified by measuring an established apoptotic marker such as annexin V reactivity.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells with the active enantiomer of nutlin-3 for 48 h induced apoptosis in a substantial fraction of the cell population that is p53-dependent, since the inactive enantiomer did not contribute to apoptosis (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The apoptotic fraction in etoposide-treated cells was slightly higher, while doxorubicin induced massive apoptosis (90%) in both cell lines.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	245	 We found that a significant fraction of the apoptosis induced at high doses was p53-independent by comparing the apoptotic fractions in isogenic variants containing (RKO) and lacking (RKO-R) a functional p53 pathway (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	246	 If the apoptotic activity of doxorubicin and etoposide in RKO-R cells is subtracted from their activity in the parental RKO cell line, the residual activity should represent the p53-dependent component of the apoptotic activity of both drugs.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The maximal residual (p53-dependent) activity for both doxorubicin and etoposide is equal or lower than the activity of nutlin-3a.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This result suggests that the p53-dependent apoptotic activity of nutlin-induced unphosphorylated p53 is equal or better than the activity of phosphorylated p53 induced by doxorubicin or etoposide.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	249	 However, one needs to acknowledge that such normalization for p53-independent activity could only be used as an approximation, since both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms may utilize the same apoptotic pathways.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Despite the possible inaccuracy, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reveal differences in the apoptotic activity of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Further studies, however, are needed to assess the possible effect of phosphorylation on transcription-independent apoptotic activity of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	252	Comparison of the activities of p53 phosphorylated on six key serine residues in response to genotoxic insult with unphosphorylated p53 induced by MDM2 antagonists revealed that phosphorylation status of p53 does not affect the main functions of the tumor suppressor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Unphosphorylated p53 is indistinguishable from phosphorylated p53 by its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activate transcription of target genes and apoptosis in vivo.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	254	 This study confirms and extends previous observations (24, 42) using an experimental system that allows assessing p53 function in its natural cellular context and reinforces the notion that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation of p53 as a transcription factor.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The data also demonstrate the importance of separating MDM2 from p53 as a key requirement for p53 activation.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	256	 They raise the question of how this is achieved in vivo in light of studies showing that p53 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated can nonetheless be activated equivalently to wild-type p53 (24).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Recent studies imply that a key event may actually be the damage-induced phosphorylation of MDM2 itself, which triggers the preferential degradation of MDM2.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This provides an effective and rapid means for removing MDM2 from p53 in vivo and for enabling p53 to engage the transcriptional apparatus for target gene induction (6).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	259	The possibility still remains that phosphorylation of p53 may affect p53 activity independent of transcription (e.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	260	 in p53-dependent apoptotic pathways).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	261	 However, previously published data from our laboratory does not support this possibility.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Treatment of the SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell line with 10  microM nutlin-3a leads to massive apoptotic death (28) comparable with that in doxorubicin-treated RKO cells (Fig.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This higher responsiveness to MDM2 antagonists is most likely due to the fact that mdm2 gene amplification in SJSA-1 cells is the only defect in the p53 pathway, while cell lines with normal MDM2 level (e.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	264	 HCT116 and RKO) are likely to have defects in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathways.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	265	The conclusion that p53 phosphorylation is not essential for execution of its major functions in the p53 pathway has one important implication for cancer therapy.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We have shown that MDM2 antagonists can stabilize p53 and inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenografts models of human cancer (28).
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	267	 However, these drugs are non-genotoxic and do not cause phosphorylation of p53.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	268	 If p53 phosphorylation is important for modulation of its transcriptional activity then the effectiveness of MDM2 antagonists may be limited.
0.60193133.15471885.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Our data support the utility of MDM2 antagonists as single therapeutic agents in treating tumors with wild-type p53 that have retained intact signaling downstream of p53.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Purified fractions of a recombinant IHD miniprotein are active in a set of in vitro assays highlighting its affinity to the N-terminal LXXLL domain of p53 including (i) dose-dependent binding to Ser-20-phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated binding to p53 tetramers; and (iii) inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The active component of the IHD miniprotein was localized to a 75-amino-acid fragment corresponding to amino acids 401 to 475 on human p300.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This minimal IHD miniprotein can function in vivo as a p53-binding polypeptide in assays including: (i) complex formation with VP16-LXXLL peptide motifs in the two-hybrid assay; (ii) action as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 from p21 luciferase templates; and (iii) attenuation of endogenous p21 protein levels.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Further, we show here that the IRF-1-dependent stabilization and reactivation of p53PRO protein (LXXLL+/PXXP-) can be neutralized by the minimal IHD miniprotein, suggesting that IHD can bind to the p53 LXXLL domain in vivo.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Phage-peptide display to the IHD miniprotein gave rise to an LSQXTFSXLXXLL consensus binding site that displays significant homology to the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The stress-activated tumor suppressor protein p53 has been well characterized as a transcription factor that associates with basal transcription machinery.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The vast array of genes that p53 induces and/or represses in response to cell injury provides an excellent model system with which to identify the complex and transient associations with co-activators/repressors and the core promoter transcriptional apparatus that drive promoter activation (2).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Central to the stress-activated transcription program of p53 is the interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300 (3).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	15	The p300/CREB-binding protein family of proteins participate in many physiological processes, including proliferation and differentiation and apoptosis (4).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	16	 p300 functions as a transcriptional co-activator that is involved in multiple signal-dependent transcription events (5).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Viral onco-proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A and SV40 T antigen, possess high affinity for specific binding sites with p300 (6), which results in the loss of cell growth control, enhancement of DNA synthesis, and blocks in cellular differentiation (7).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	18	 There are data implicating altered p300 gene expression in an array of human tumors (5).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	19	 p300 contains three broad functional domains including: (i) an acetyltransferase domain that mediates substrate acetylation; (ii) a bromodomain, which is implicated in binding to acetylated amino acids; and (iii) a variety of LXXLL, PXXP, and other transactivation peptide-binding domains.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The coordinated function of these domains is thought to mediate the role of p300 as a bridge, scaffold, and/or catalyst for binding to transcriptional components and the activation of gene expression.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	21	The tetrameric nature of p53, its allosteric properties, the enzymatic activity of p300 involved in its activation of p53, and the multiple transactivation peptide-binding domains of p300 make the p300:p53 complex an attractive model to understand the dynamic nature of a biological machine, an important goal in the dissection of the proteome.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The molecular mechanism by which p53 tetramers interact with p300 and how this modulates acetylation are beginning to be defined biochemically.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Reconstitution of purified forms of the p300:p53 protein complex in vitro followed by validation in vivo have identified sequential stages in p300:p53 complex dynamics and include: (i) docking-dependent phosphorylation of the LXXLL motif at Thr-18 or Ser-20 by enzymes of the calcium-calmodulin superfamily such as CHK2 and CHK1 (8); (ii) stabilization of p300 binding to the p53 activation domain by phosphorylation at Thr-18 or Ser-20 (9); (iii) anchoring of p300 to the contiguous phospho-LXXLL and PXXP activation domains in p53 (10); (iv) sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, which induces a conformational change in the tetramer, forcing acetylation to be DNA-dependent and PXXP-dependent (10); and (v) acetylation of DNA-bound p53 that in turn stabilizes the p300:acetylated p53:DNA complex (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	24	 How this multidomain scaffold arranges itself onto an "octavalent" substrate such as p53 is not known, nor is it known how acetylation of the native p53 oligomer can be constrained in the absence of consensus site DNA.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The ability of IF-1 protein to bind to p300 and stimulate p53 acetylation by a novel allosteric mechanism (see also Ref.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	26	 22) further highlights the multifaceted and dynamic nature of the p300:p53 complex assembly.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	27	 To continue dissecting out how p300 can bind to p53, we have mapped the various Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL and PXXP peptide-binding domains of p300 and have found them to map to regions distinct from the classic C/H1 and C/H3 p53 activation-binding domains (10).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These peptide-binding regions in p300, in turn, are distinct from the binding of IRF-1 activation domain interfaces on p300 (see also Ref.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Together with mapping data from other approaches, these data identify at least eight peptide-binding minidomains of p300 that can contact p53 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD,1 IHD, SPC-1, SPC-2, KIX, and Bromo.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	30	The major Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL p53-binding domains of p300 have been mapped to the C-terminal IBiD (12) and N-terminal IHD scaffolds (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Both of these miniproteins can function as dominant negative inhibitors of p300-coactivated stimulation of p53-depednent gene expression in cells (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, only the C-terminal IBiD domain has been examined structurally (12).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The IBiD scaffold was defined by mapping regions of p300 that bind to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3, although the miniprotein can also bind to non-phosphorylated activation domain fragments of other proteins.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This apparent lack of "sequence specificity" in IBiD miniprotein binding to activation domain peptides is rationalized by the ability of unstructured activation domain peptides to acquire structure by an induced fit mechanism upon scaffold binding.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, it may be the capacity of a peptide to form a helix that makes it a good IBiD-binding motif.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The structure and minimal LXXLL peptide binding activity of the N-terminal IHD miniprotein are not known, nor is it known whether the IHD scaffold has intrinsic peptide consensus site for selected polypeptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Characterization of IHD and determination of whether it has a stringent peptide-docking site consensus site will advance dissection of the p300:p53 complex assembly.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In this report, we define the minimal IHD scaffold to a 75-aminoacid fragment with homology to the minimal IBiD region of p300, demonstrate that IHD can contact the LXXLL region of p53 by a variety of assays including inhibition of IRF-1 reactivation of p53PRO, and demonstrate by phage-peptide display that the IHD miniprotein prefers a consensus peptide motif with significant homology to the LXXLL motif of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These data indicate that IHD is a bona fide LXXLL-p53 scaffold that promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complex between p53 and the co-activator p300.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	40	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Reagents and Enzymes Recombinant human p53 was purified from insect cells and bacterial expression systems using heparin-Sepharose, as described previously (13).

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	192	 4C), the ability of IHD to inhibit p53 activity is presumably not due to its binding to the proline-repeat transactivation domain, which can also contact p300 directly.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	195	 There were some differences in the specific activity of IHD miniprotein deletion variants as p53 inhibitors; for example, the IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 501) was not as effective as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 as other IHD derivatives (amino acids 401 to 475 and amino acids 401 to 553), especially at intermediate levels of gene transfected (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These data suggest that polypeptide fragments encoded from amino acids 476 to 501 can affect the specific activity of IHD as a p53-binding domain and/or that factors in vivo are binding to it in trans to the region and competing it away from p53.

0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	234	 7B, lane 4 versus lanes 5 and 2).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Interestingly, transfection of increasing amounts of IRF-1 protein is also able to stabilize p53PRO (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	236	 7B, lanes 2 to 4 versus lane 1).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These data indicate that p53 activity can be uncoupled from the proline-repeat activation domain, presumably by the ability of IRF-1 to enhance p300 contact with the LXXLL activation domain in p53, which in turn stabilizes and activates p53PRO.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This hypothesis can be tested using the IHD miniprotein.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	239	 If IRF-1 effects on activating p53PRO are due to the stabilization of the p300:LXXLL motif, then we would predict that IHD would block IRF-1 stimulatory effects.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Maximal p53PRO activity from the p21-luciferase reporter induced by IRF-1 transfection (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	241	 7C, lane 3 versus lanes 2 and 1) can be attenuated by the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	242	 7C, lanes 4 to 7 versus lane 3) as well as the 8-kDa IHD miniprotein (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	243	 7C, lanes 8 to 11 versus lane 3).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The attenuation by IHD of IRF-1-dependent p53PRO activity (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	245	 7C) can also be linked to the destabilization by IHD of p53PRO protein levels in the presence of IRF-1 protein (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Using fixed amounts of p53PRO and inhibitory levels of the IHD miniprotein (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	247	 7D, lanes 1 to 3), a titration of IRF-1 protein actually destabilizes p53PRO (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	248	 7D, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Using fixed amounts of p53PRO and the small IHD derivative (amino acids 401 to 475) (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	250	 7D, lanes 4 to 6), a titration of IRF-1 protein similarly destabilizes p53PRO (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	251	 7D, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 3).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These data suggest that the LXXLL activation domain is indeed the target of IRF-1 stabilization of p53PRO and that the minimal IHD miniprotein can contact the LXXLL domain of p53 in vivo.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	253	Structural studies on the IBiD, C/H1, and C/H3 domains of p300 have demonstrated an interaction of the minimal peptide-binding domains with activation domain peptides of no apparent sequence similarity.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	254	 It is generally held that such small peptides acquire helical structure when bound to the peptide-binding scaffold.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Although our characterization of IHD indicates that it can bind to LXXLL-containing polypeptides, it is not yet clear whether the IHD miniprotein displays any sequence preference for the p53 sequence, LXXLL-containing peptides, or other alternate consensus sequences.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We have previously used phage-peptide display as an in vitro method for identifying novel protein-protein interfaces in MDM2-p53 and p300:p53 complexes (10, 14).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This technique has the advantage of fixing bait protein in a solid phase in a native conformation and incubating with a library containing random 12-mer peptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The 17-kDa His-tagged IHD miniprotein was captured in the solid phase with an anti-His monoclonal antibody and incubated with phage libraries through three rounds of selection.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Identical His-tagged bait capture methods identified proline repeat-containing peptides as preferentially enriched using full-length p300 (10).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In this latter study, it was relatively surprising that LXXLL-containing peptides were not selected given the number of LXXLL-binding domains present in p300.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	261	 When high affinity peptides were enriched after three rounds of selection, three general classes of peptides were identified.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In the first class of peptides (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	263	 8A), a striking similarity in the peptides isolated to the p53 activation domain identified critical consensus site contacts for IHD into three small motifs across the activation domain: PLSQ, T(F/Y)S, and SXLXXL.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	264	 These data suggest that the IHD miniprotein can display some relative specificity for p53 activation domain fragments, although other peptides with a match to this consensus can be identified using an e-motif search engine (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	265	 A second class of peptides (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	266	 8B) showed less of a similarity than class I peptides but did display the retention of a Gln residue (which is critical for full-length p300 to contact the serine 20 phosphorylated p53 activation domain), a core (T/S)(F/W)(S/T)(D/E) motif, and an LXXL motif.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The third class of peptides displayed less resemblance to p53 but maintained a Gln residue and a relatively loose consensus of (S/T)QXX(F/W/Y)(S/T)XXXXL.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	268	 A general consensus site developed for IHD was PLSQXFSX-LXXLL and suggests that either the miniprotein has a very high affinity for the p53 activation domain fragment or that such consensus site peptide fragments have the capacity to adopt a helical conformation upon IHD scaffold binding, giving rise to an apparent consensus site.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	269	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   p53 has been shown to be regulated by two distinct pathways that direct the biochemical actions of the tumor suppressor.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	270	 MDM2 forms a component of a negative regulatory feedback pathway that promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and subsequent degradation of p53 through the proteasome (17).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	271	 p300 competes for the same binding region as MDM2 present within the N-terminal LXXLL transactivation domain of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This co-activator protein forms part of a positive regulatory component that is essential for p53 required for p53 stabilization after DNA damage and induces its transcriptional responses.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	273	 p300-catalyzed acetylation of native p53 tetramers requires two associated events: p300 docking to the two contiguous LXXLL and PXXP/PXP activation domains of p53 and sequence-specific DNA to function as an allosteric activator by removing conformational constraints on p53 acetylation.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	274	 It is not known how p300 docks to the p53 tetramer, whether it involves one or more of the peptide-binding domains of p300 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD, IHD, SPC-1, or SPC-2, and whether a rearrangement of the p300:p53 complex occurs after acetylation to stabilize the p300-bromo domain binding to the acetylated p53 residue.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Such a rearrangement or an allosteric mechanism appears to operate since a small peptide derived from IRF-1:p300 interface can bind p300 and stimulate in trans the enzymatic activity of p300 (22).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	276	As a means to begin answering these questions, in this report, we have fine-mapped one p53 docking site on p300, named IHD, and provided evidence that this minidomain of p300 is a bona fide polypeptide-binding domain that possesses an intrinsic ability to bind to peptides with homology to the p53 LXXLL activation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	277	 One key feature of the IHD miniprotein is that it mimics full-length p300 in its stabilization by phosphorylation at the serine 20 residue (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Although serine 20 phosphorylation function was originally thought to be in the reduction of MDM2-binding to p53, biophysical studies have demonstrated that serine 20 phosphorylation has no impact on MDM2 binding (15).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Rather, this phosphorylation stabilizes p300-binding to p53, and as an indirect consequence, prevents MDM2 binding to p53 (23).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Genetic studies have shown that mutation of the serine 20 residue in cell lines or in mice models attenuates p53 apoptotic activity (24, 25), suggesting that phosphorylation at this residue is important for p53 function.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Further mutation of the equivalent serine 20 residue in murine p53 or knockout of the known serine 20 kinase, CHK2, have the same phenotype in mice; p53 protein can still be stabilized by irradiation but has a lower specific activity as transcription factor or apoptotic inducer (21, 25).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These genetic data can be reinterpreted to suggest that the role of serine 20 phosphorylation is to stabilize p300 binding based on the following data.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	283	 (i) p53 activity is attenuated by serine 20 phosphopeptide mimetics that bind to and neutralize p300 (9); (ii) full-length p300 is stabilized by phosphorylation of the p53 activation domain at serine 20 (9); and (iii) serine 20 phosphopeptides can block DNA-dependent acetylation of p53 by p300 (11).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In this report, we show that the minimal IHD miniprotein can bind preferentially to full-length p53 tetramers that are phosphorylated at serine 20 and that IHD binding can be further stimulated in binding to p53 by consensus site DNA (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This mimics full-length p300 properties and suggests that the IHD domain may be an important component of p53 stabilization to p300 after DNA damage via CHK2 phosphorylation at serine 20.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	286	Based on previous data, it was suggested that p300 minidomains such as IBiD do not necessarily prefer a specific polypeptide primary amino acid sequence.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Our work using phagepeptide display suggests that IHD can prefer a specific peptide sequence.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	288	 To find novel high affinity ligands for IHD domain, we screened phage display peptide libraries for IHD-binding phage and sequenced a series of clones encoding 12-mer peptides.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The peptide sequences showed surprisingly good homology with the previously established p300-binding domain on p53 (14 to 25 amino acids), confirming that the peptide PLSQETFSDLWKLLP region is crucial for the interaction between p300 and p53 and that IHD can be responsible for stabilizing p300:p53 complexes that are transcriptionally competent.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Underlined residues represent the match of the phasepeptides to the p53 activation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The selection for the three submotif-containing peptides (LSQ.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	292	 L) is not common in our experience of this technique and therefore not due to the overenrichment or "stickiness" of this peptide class in the phage library.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	293	 For example, using full-length p300, we enriched proline-repeat peptides (PXXP), using DAPK3, we enriched p21-like peptides (RKKXT), and using ligand-complexed MDM2, we enriched a variety of peptides with little homology to the p53 activation domain (10, 14, 18).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Further, using ligand-free MDM2 as a control, we did acquire peptides with homology to the p53 activation domain but with the consensus TFXXXWXXL that fits with the known contacts in the MDM2-p53 activation domain structure (14).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	295	Another advantage of phage-peptide display is that peptide consensus sequences developed can be used to identify novel binding partners.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	296	 We have used this to identify HSP90 as a novel MDM2-binding protein that controls p53 unfolding and have identified novel cell cycle substrates of the interferon-induced kinase DAPK3 (14, 18).
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Further, the proline-repeat peptides pulled out using p300 as a bait (10) identified a large panel of LXXLL containing transcription factors that, like p53, have flanking LXXLL motifs of a contiguous PXXP or PXPXP motif in their transactivation domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In examining the IHD consensus peptides for homology to other proteins in the databases, there are several other interesting transcription factors and viral onco-proteins that possess IHD consensus sites that could potentially interact also with p300 through this docking site domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	299	 These proteins include oncogenic Ras-related Rab 721, cyclin G, CHK2, SV40 large T antigen, DNA and RNA polymerases, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA-6), and more (Fig.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The result that large T-antigen could potentially bind p300 via IHD is of great interest since p53 responses are abrogated in the presence of T-antigen and SV40 infection culminates in the degradation of p53 and loss of proliferative control (19), thereby supporting the notion that T-antigen has another mechanism of disrupting the critical activities of tumor suppressor proteins.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In fact, T-antigen was reported to bind to p300 (20), and this may be mediated in part through the IHD domain.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	302	In summary, we have characterized the minimal IHD LXXLL peptide-binding region of p300 and determined that it can display similar characteristics of full-length p300 including affinity for LXXLL-containing peptides, DNA-stimulated binding to serine 20 phosphorylated p53 tetramers, and in vivo interaction with the LXXLL activation domain of p53.
0.4995434.15337767.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Future work will involve determining the dominance in the known LXXLL-binding domains in p300 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD, and IHD and how these domains effect DNA-dependent acetylation of p53.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The choice between these cellular responses is influenced by many factors, including the type of cell and stress, and the action of p53 co-activators.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	8	 p53 stimulates a wide network of signals that act through two major apoptotic pathways.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The extrinsic, death receptor pathway triggers the activation of a caspase cascade, and the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway shifts the balance in the Bcl-2 family towards the pro-apoptotic members, promoting the formation of the apoptosome, and consequently caspase-mediated apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The impact of these two apoptotic pathways may be enhanced when they converge through Bid, which is a p53 target.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The majority of these apoptotic effects are mediated through the induction of specific apoptotic target genes.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, a multitude of mechanisms are employed by p53 to ensure efficient induction of apoptosis in a stage-, tissue- and stress-signal-specific manner.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The ability of p53 to eliminate excess, damaged or infected cells by apoptosis (Kerr et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	21	, 1972) is vital for the proper regulation of cell proliferation in multi-cellular organisms (Huang and Strasser, 2000).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	22	 p53 is activated by external and internal stress signals that promote its nuclear accumulation in an active form.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In turn, p53 induces either viable cell growth arrest or apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The latter activity is crucial for tumor suppression.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The growth inhibitory activities of p53 prevent the proliferation of cells with damaged DNA or with a potential for neoplastic transformation.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, p53 contributes to cellular processes such as differentiation, DNA repair and angiogenesis, which also appear to be vital for tumor suppression (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	27	Being a key player in the cellular response to stress, p53 serves as the major obstruction for tumorigenesis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This obstacle has to be removed in order to allow tumor development.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Indeed, approximately 50% of human cancers bear p53 gene mutations; in the majority of the remaining cancer cases, p53 activity is compromised by alternative mechanisms (Vogelstein et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These involve elevation in the expression levels of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2 or the E6 protein of HPV, or silencing of key p53 co-activators, such as ARF (Vogelstein et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	31	Under normal conditions p53 is a short-lived protein.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The p53 inhibitor Mdm2 (Hdm2 in humans) is largely responsible for keeping p53 in this state.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Mdm2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 and, more importantly, promotes its degradation by the proteasome.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, the status of p53 is drastically altered when cells are exposed to stress, including DNA damage, untimely expression of oncogenes, hypoxia and nucleotide depletion (reviewed by Giaccia and Kastan, 1998).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	35	 p53 activation involves stabilization of the protein, and enhancement of its DNA binding and transcriptional activity.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These changes in p53 are mediated by extensive post-translational modifications of p53 and protein-protein interactions with cooperating factors.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Ultimately, the activation of p53 leads to cell growth arrest, senescence or apoptosis, the choice of which depends on the summation of the incoming signals and the cellular context (see below).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because the apoptotic function of p53 is critical for tumor suppression, reconstitution of inactive p53-dependent apoptotic pathways is an attractive approach currently being explored for anti-cancer treatment.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	45	 It restricts cellular growth by inducing senescence, cell cycle arrest (at G1 and/or G2 phase) or apoptosis (Jin and Levine, 2001).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The exact criteria that influence p53 to stimulate cell cycle arrest or apoptosis are only partially understood and are the subject of intense study.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Several general factors that influence this decision include p53 expression levels, the type of stress signal, the cell type and the cellular context at the time of exposure to stress (reviewed by Balint and Vousden, 2001; Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Several intriguing observations have recently provided insight into the apparent intricacies of such cell fate determination.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The examples described below involve the binding of p53 to its canonical binding sequence in target genes (el-Deiry et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Note, however, that p53 can also activate target genes through a non-canonical sequence.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The first such example is in the p53-induced gene 3 (PIG3), which has been implicated in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis induction (Polyak et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	52	 PIG3 can be induced by p53 through a microsatellite sequence within its untranslated region (Contente et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Another recently described example is the gene encoding the pro-apoptotic phosphatase PAC1, which is induced through binding of p53 to a novel palindromic binding site (Yin et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This might represent a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation of apoptotic genes by p53, which differs from that already described (see below).

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In response to DNA damage, the binding affinity of p53 for the promoter of the cell-cycle-regulating gene p21WAF/CIP1 (p21) is unchanged, whereas binding to the promoter of the DNA-repair-associated gene Gadd45 is reduced.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This is due, primarily, to oxidation of Cys277, residing within human p53, which contacts the third base (the first pyrimidine residue) in the p53-binding consensus pentamer A/TGPyPyPy: where the p53-binding element of p21 is 5'-GAACATGTCCcAACATGTTg-3' and that of GADD45 is 5'-GAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTg-3' (and where the critical residues that determine the binding to Cys277 are indicated in red, and consensus-fitting bases are in uppercase).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Although the mechanism of p53 Cys277 oxidation is unclear, it may be associated with the production of oxygen radicals that are induced in response to exposure to high-dose UV light (Buzek et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	62	Only under reducing conditions is the affinity of p53 for the Gadd45 promoter increased, which suggests that the reduction of Cys277 is necessary to enable binding of p53 to C-rich binding sequences, such as that of Gadd45.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	63	 found that reduction of residues Cys275 and Cys277 by selenomethionine (the major dietary source of selenium) caused p53 to recruit the p53-binding redox factor Ref1 and activate DNA-repair machinery through the induction of Gadd45, without affecting cell growth (Seo et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Thus, the redox state of p53 Cys277 appears to serve as a switch for activating the DNA repair machinery.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This selective activation of p53-dependent DNA repair activity has been proposed as a novel approach to cancer prevention (Gudkov, 2002).

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	80	 However, when Myc is present, exposure to UV triggers its recruitment by Miz-1 to the proximal promoter region of p21.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This interaction effectively represses p21 induction by p53 and other activators (Herold et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Intriguingly, this repression appears to be specific for p21, because other p53-target genes, such as p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and PIG3, are induced.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This block in p21 induction shifts the balance away from growth arrest towards apoptosis (Seoane et al.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	89	A novel insight into the interplay between p53 and its family members, p63 and p73, in the induction of apoptosis has been recently revealed by Flores et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Their study of the effect of p63 and p73 on p53 transcriptional activity, using a selection of knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), defined two distinct classes of target gene.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Whereas p53 alone is sufficient for the induction of p21 and Mdm2, the induction of the apoptotic genes PERP, Bax and Noxa requires p53 together with p63 and p73.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This finding demonstrates an essential role for both p63 and p73 in the efficient induction of apoptotic target genes by p53.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The mechanism of this cooperation is currently unknown, but it may involve an enhanced binding to and/or stabilization of the transcription complex on the promoters of p53 apoptotic target genes by the cooperative action of all three members (Urist and Prives, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In addition to the contribution of p63 and p73 to the apoptotic function of p53, they play an important role in the precise control of cell death during normal mouse development.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	101	 p53-mediated growth arrest is however impaired in these mice owing to pRb loss of function, but the apoptotic activity is functional.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	102	 These mice develop choroid plexus tumors, but at a slow rate owing to continuous p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Elimination of p53 from these mice, by crossbreeding with p53-null mice, resulted in aggressive tumor development.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This finding suggested that tumor suppression is primarily due to p53-mediated apoptosis (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The most compelling insight into this fundamental question came from a recent study using the E micro-myc-mediated lymphoma mouse model.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The apoptotic pathway of the lymphoma cells was blocked either by retroviral expression of bcl-2 or a dominant negative caspase-9.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The effect of this block on the growth of these lymphomas was then tested in recipient mice.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In the apoptosis-impaired cells there was no selection for p53 mutations, in contrast to cells that had intact apoptotic pathways.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Remarkably, in the apoptosis-impaired lymphoma cells expressing functional p53, the integrity of the genome and the cell cycle checkpoints were maintained.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Taken together these studies support the notion that apoptosis is the critical function of p53 in tumor suppression.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	111	How p53 mediates apoptosis has been a matter of intensive study since this was first demonstrated (Yonish-Rouach et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Numerous publications have recently described the importance of p53 transcriptional regulation of components of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	114	 p53 is also able to promote apoptosis through transcription-independent apoptotic mechanisms.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Moreover, transcriptionally inactive mutants of p53 can induce apoptosis in certain cell types (Haupt et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	117	, 1995), and PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT), which blocks binding of p53 to DNA, does not inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis (Nelson et al.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Presumably, these activities of p53 require cooperation with other apoptotic factors - for instance E2F-1 (a transcription factor in the retinoblastoma protein pathway) (reviewed by Vogt Sionov and Haupt, 1999).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Experimental cell transformation may mimic various stages of tumor development, where the apoptotic function of p53 is being activated and becomes critical for the suppression of tumor progression.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	128	 The extrinsic pathway involves engagement of particular `death' receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family and, through the formation of the death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998), leads to a cascade of activation of caspases, including caspase-8 and caspase-3, which in turn induce apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The intrinsic pathway is triggered in response to DNA damage and is associated with mitochondrial depolarization and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This may allow p53 to rapidly sensitize cells to Fas-induced apoptosis before the transcription-dependent effect operates.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	145	 How p53 promotes Fas trafficking is not understood.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	146	The second member of this receptor family that is induced by p53 is DR5/KILLER, the death-domain-containing receptor for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	147	 DR5 is induced by p53 in response to DNA damage (Wu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	148	, 1997) and in turn promotes cell death through caspase-8 (reviewed by Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	149	 DR5 induction is cell type specific.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Whole body -irradiation induces DR5 expression in the spleen, small intestine and thymus (Burns et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	151	, 2001), which is consistent with DR5 participating in the p53-mediated response to DNA damage in these tissues.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Strikingly, in MEFs exposed to DNA damage (by doxorubicin), similar levels of DR5 were identified in cells undergoing G1 arrest and apoptosis (Attardi et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Thus, the contribution of DR5 to these different p53-determined cell fates remains to be clarified.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	154	Another apoptotic gene, PERP, is induced in MEFs in response to DNA-damage in cells transduced with either E2F-1 or with the adenoviral E1A protein, which targets pRb, thereby releasing active E2F-1.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In this context, PERP probably cooperates with E2F-1 to induce apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	156	 PERP is a putative tetraspan transmembrane protein that represents a new member of the PMP-22/gas family of proteins implicated in cell growth regulation.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The kinetics of PERP induction in response to DNA damage and the presence of a p53-responsive element in the PERP promoter support the notion that it is a direct p53 target.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	158	 A role for PERP in apoptosis is suggested by the significantly higher levels of PERP mRNA in cells undergoing apoptosis than in arresting cells.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The Bcl-2 family comprises anti-apoptotic (pro-survival) and pro-apoptotic members.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Family members are classified on the basis of structural similarity to the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4), and a transmembrane domain.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The BH3 domain, which is present in all members and is essential for heterodimerization among members, is the minimum domain required for the proapoptotic function (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998; Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The Bcl-2 family is divisible into three classes: pro-survival proteins, whose members are most structurally similar to Bcl-2, such as Bcl-XL; pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, which are structurally similar to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and antagonize their pro-survival functions; and the pro-apoptotic `BH3-only' proteins (Bouillet and Strasser, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Intriguingly, a key subset of the Bcl-2 family genes are p53 targets, including Bax, Noxa, PUMA and the most recently identified, Bid.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	169	Bax was the first member of this group shown to be induced by p53, but p53-responsive elements have only recently been unequivocally identified in the Bax gene (Thornborrow et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In response to stress activation, Bax forms a homodimer and releases cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Skulachev, 1998), which results in caspase-9 activation (reviewed by Adams and Cory, 1998).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The requirement for Bax in p53-mediated apoptosis appears to be cell-type dependent.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Bax is required for the apoptotic response of the developing nervous system to -irradiation (Chong et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	173	, 2000) and contributes to chemotherapy-induced killing of E1A-expressing fibroblasts (McCurrach et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	174	In contrast, equivalent levels of Bax induced in MEFs undergoing either arrest or apoptosis had been understood to indicate that Bax does not dictate cellular fate in these cells (Attardi et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In addition, in colonic epithelia undergoing apoptosis in response to -irradiation, Bax did not appear to be essential (Pritchard et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	176	A fascinating explanation for the apparent enigmatic role of Bax in apoptosis induction has recently been offered in the context of PUMA.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The PUMA gene is also directly induced by p53 in response to DNA damage, through p53-responsive elements within the first intron of PUMA.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In humans, PUMA encodes two BH3-domain-containing proteins, PUMA- and PUMA-ss (Nakano and Vousden, 2001; Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	179	 A vital balance between PUMA and p21 has been identified to determine the onset of arrest, or death, in response to exogenous p53 expression and also hypoxia in human colorectal cancer cells.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Growth arrest through activation of p21 is the normal response to p53 expression in these cells.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	181	 If p21 is disrupted the cells die through apoptosis; if, however, PUMA is disrupted, apoptosis is prevented.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Bax is absolutely required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	183	 PUMA expression promotes mitochondrial translocation and mulitmerization of Bax, culminating in apoptosis induction (Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Thus, although p53 can bind to the Bax promoter, the affinity is weak in contrast to p21 and PUMA binding (Kaeser and Iggo, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Bax thus participates in the death response as an indirect target of p53 through PUMA (Yu et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	186	Another p53 target gene, Noxa, contains a single p53-responsive element in its promoter and is induced in response to X-ray irradiation (Oda et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Noxa encodes a BH3-only protein and hence is likely to contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis in a similar manner to PUMA and Bax, although this is yet to be demonstrated.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Thus, it appears that, in response to DNA damage, p53 activates the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression of at least three Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic family members, shifting the balance towards pro-apoptotic effects.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In another study the response to IR of thymocytes from Apaf-1/caspase-9 null mice was compared with that of normal mice.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This comparison revealed an impaired response, but neither protection from apoptosis nor normal sensitivity to IR-induced death (Marsden et al.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This apparent difference may represent a different role for the apoptosome in Myc-expressing fibroblasts versus normal thymocytes.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	200	 It may also suggest that the apoptosome can contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis, but perhaps is not essential for it to occur, at least in thymocytes.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	201	Caspase activation Caspase-9 and caspase-2 respond to changes in mitochondrial potential, whereas caspase-8 and caspase-10 sense activation of death receptors.

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In turn, AKT phosphorylates a range of targets that function to promote cell survival, including the major inhibitor of p53, Mdm2 (reviewed by Mayo and Donner, 2002).
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This phosphorylation enhances the nuclear accumulation of Mdm2, augments Mdm2 interaction with p300, and reduces the affinity of Mdm2 for p19ARF (reviewed by Testa and Bellacosa, 2001).

0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Intriguingly, p53 can intervene at every major step in apoptotic pathways: from extrinsic death receptor signaling, through the convergent pathway component Bid, to the intrinsic mitochondria pathways involving apoptosome formation, and culminating in direct caspase activation.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Many of these effects are mediated through the activation of specific p53-target genes.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In addition, p53 is able to activate apoptotic pathways by transcription-independent mechanisms (including direct shuttling of p53 to the mitochondrial membrane), more of which are likely to be unraveled in the future.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Why is this complex apoptotic network required? One possible reason may be to ensure a rapid response.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Another is that specific sets of target genes might be activated under a given set of conditions, in a stage-, tissue- and stimulus-specific manner.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Alternatively, active p53 may induce the same set of target genes under different conditions, the specificity being determined by other cellular factors.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Currently there are examples to support each of these options.
0.6178579.12972501.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Defining the effect of these variables on p53 transcriptional activity using genome-wide expression analysis may help to answer some of these fundamental questions.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Chromatin remodelling is necessary to allow such processes to proceed and may be defined as a discernible alteration in chromatin structure that results in a change in the accessibility of a region of DNA.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This encompasses changes induced by ATP-dependent remodelling complexes that can alter nucleosomal positioning, and post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones, which may alter the interactions between histones and the DNA (2,3).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Post-translational histone modification may also play a role in chromatin remodelling indirectly through the specific recruitment of non-histone proteins such as ATP-dependent remodelling complexes to chromatin (4,5).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The N-termini of the core histones are subject to a plethora of site-specific modifications including acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation (5).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The significance of these modifications can vary between the different histones.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For example, modification of the histone H3 has critical roles in heterochromatin and euchromatin formation (6), global chromatin condensation for mitosis (7 to 11), and chromatin remodelling for transcription and repair (5,12,13).

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The susceptibility of different genes to chromatin repression can vary considerably, however, depending upon factors such as the exact positioning of nucleosomes over the gene promoter and the ability of transcription factors to compete with histones for binding DNA (1,15).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Consequently, the contribution of chromatin remodelling to regulation of gene expression can also differ drastically between genes.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	26	A number of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressor complexes that bind p53 in vivo possess histone-modifying activities (16 to 20) suggesting that targeted chromatin remodelling may be important for p53 function as a transcription factor.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, in several cases the ability of a protein to act as a transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor has been shown to be dependent upon its enzymatic activity (21,22).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases also target non-histone proteins for acetylation/deacetylation and, interestingly, such targets include p53 (16 to 19,23,24).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	29	 p53 is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including acetylation at a number of sites in its C-terminus (19,23,24).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The co-activator and HAT p300 directly acetylates p53 at several lysine residues and acetylation has been reported to affect aspects of p53 function including DNA-binding (19,23,24), stability (25,26) and subcellular localization (27,28).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Since p53 is a substrate for HATs and HDACs (16 to 19,23 to 26) it is quite likely that changes in p53-dependent transcription upon recruitment of these activities may not necessarily be due to changes in histone acetylation.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A number of studies have addressed this issue directly and for some p53 target genes histone modification rather than modification of p53 is important for p53-dependent changes in gene expression (20,29 to 31).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	33	p53 can activate or repress transcription of a variety of cellular genes (32,33).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	34	 p53-induced growth arrest seems to be mediated by transactivation of the p21 gene and several independent studies have sought to understand the mechanisms by which p53 regulates p21 transcription.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Using a reconstituted in vitro transcription system with a chromatin-assembled p21 promoter, Epsinosa and Emerson found that the ability of p53 and p300 to activate p21 transcription is dependent upon cooperation to overcome the repressive effects of chromatin packing rather than acetylation of p53 by p300 (29).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that p53 recruits p300 to the p21 promoter thereby enabling targeted acetylation of chromatin-assembled core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (29).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	37	Barlev and colleagues investigated how acetylation of p53 increases transcription of p21 in vivo (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Following gamma irradiation they used chromatin immunoprecipitation to analyse the effects of p53 acetylation status on the association of p53 and of non-acetylatable p53 mutants with the endogenous p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Consistent with the results of Epsinosa and Emerson, acetylation of p53 had no discernible effect on p53 binding to the endogenous p21 promoter.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Exploring other possibilities, they found that acetylation of p53 promotes the association of the co-activators CBP and TRRAP with the p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	41	 While CBP has intrinsic HAT activity (34), TRRAP is a component of multiple co-activator complexes with HAT activity including PCAF, TFTC, STAGA and Tip60 complexes (35,36).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Recruitment of CBP and TRRAP by acetylated p53 correlated with elevated levels of acetylated H3 and H4 at the endogenous p21 promoter (30).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In another study, a variety of p53 mutants expressed in stable cell lines were analysed for their ability to activate endogenous p21 transcription (37).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	44	 While ChIP analysis revealed that the abilities of most of the mutants to bind to the p21 promoter was equivalent to that of wild-type p53, differences in their ability to activate transcription correlated directly with the extent of histone acetylation and levels of p300/CBP at the p21 promoter (37).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In further support of the importance of chromatin remodelling in p53-mediated regulation of p21 transcription, Lagger et al.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	46	 have discovered recently that p53 and the histone deacetylase HDAC1 are antagonistic regulators of p21 gene expression in vivo and that p53 can displace HDAC1 from the p21 promoter (38).

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Here transcriptional activation is dependent on recruitment of TRRAP, correlating with increased histone acetylation suggesting that chromatin remodelling is also important for p53-dependent regulation of mdm2 transcription (31).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	49	p53 also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes in vivo and work by Murphy et al.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	50	 indicates that such interactions may be important for transcriptional repression by p53 (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	51	 p53 recruits the transcriptional co-repressor mSin3a, which binds HDAC1, to the endogenous Map4 promoter, and this was found to correlate with histone deacetylation and reduced transcription (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A abrogated the ability of p53 to repress transcription of the p53 target genes Map4 and stathmin (20).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	53	Several subunits of the ATP-dependent remodelling complex SWI/SNF have also been shown to bind p53 and p53 can recruit hSNF and hBRG1 to the endogenous p21 promoter in vivo (39).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Moreover, whilst over-expression of hSNF5 and BRG1 stimulated p53-dependent transcription of a reporter construct, dominant-negative forms of hSNF5 and BRG1 repressed transcription, p53-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (39).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	55	It is apparent from these and other studies that regulation of local chromatin structure by p53, mediated through the varying actions of histone deacetylases, HATs and ATP-dependent remodelling complexes, is important for p53 function as a transcription factor.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This is summarized in Figure 1, which shows a schematic of both transcriptional repression and transcriptional activation by p53 through local changes in chromatin structure.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	57	 There is evidence that the mechanisms by which p53 activates or represses transcription may differ for different genes and that chromatin remodelling may be more important for changes in gene expression at some genes than others (31,40).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The majority of studies have focused on the p21 gene and further work is required to look at the relative contribution of chromatin remodelling to p53-mediated changes in transcription at different p53 target genes.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Amongst the most common forms of DNA damage are bulky DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts caused by UV-irradiation and other environmental carcinogens (41).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These types of lesions are eliminated by NER, which comprises of two subpathways: transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which removes lesions from actively transcribed regions of the genome, and global genomic repair (GGR), which erases damage in non-transcribed regions (41).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Efficient detection of these lesions requires chromatin relaxation (42 to 45) and for TCR the  opening  of chromatin by passage of the RNA polymerase along its template seems sufficient (45).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	69	 For GGR global chromatin relaxation is required to allow detection of lesions throughout the genome (43 to 45).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	70	Although it is well documented that efficient NER requires p53 (46) its exact role has been difficult to define.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Significantly, NER reconstituted in vitro with naked DNA has no requirement for p53 (47) but p53 is necessary for efficient NER in its natural context of chromatin and notably only for GGR (48,49).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Moreover, the effect of p53 on the efficiency of GGR is much greater for CPDs than 6-4 photoproducts (48,49).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	73	 CPDs are often located within nucleosomes and are thus much more dependent on chromatin relaxation for their repair than 6-4 photoproducts, which are only found in linker DNA (50).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Together the data are clearly suggestive that p53 may function in NER by facilitating access to the chromatin for GGR.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Using microscopy Rubbi and Milner asked if p53 can induce global chromatin relaxation for GGR and demonstrated that p53 is required for global chromatin relaxation induced by UV-irradiation (Figure 2) (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Interestingly, the UV dose of 4 J/m2 used in this study is half the minimum dose necessary to activate p53 as a transcription factor (51 to 53).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This suggests that p53-dependent global chromatin relaxation is due to transcription-independent effects of p53.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Furthermore, xeroderma pigmentosum cells deficient in p48, XPC or XPA all showed normal UV-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR (43) thus demonstrating that the p53 requirement for global chromatin relaxation is not mediated by p48 or XPC transcriptional targets of p53.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Under conditions in which p53 is activated as a transcription factor it is likely that p53 also has additional roles in NER (and perhaps chromatin accessibility) through the transcriptional induction of repair factors such as p48 and XPC (54 to 57).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Recent work from Ford and colleagues has shown that p48 can rapidly co-localize with CPD-containing foci following localized UV-irradiation and that p48 facilitates localization of XPC at such foci, leading to the suggestion that p48 may remodel chromatin thereby enabling the recognition of CPDs by XPC (56,57).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Here it is important to distinguish between chromatin relaxation and chromatin remodelling, and to note that p48 is dispensable for p53-dependent chromatin relaxation (43) (see above) but may facilitate chromatin remodelling (56,57).

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The histone acetyltransferase p300 co-localizes with p53 to sites of NER and inhibition of p300 by antibody microinjection inhibits NER suggesting that p53-dependent recruitment of p300 HAT activity may be mechanistically involved in the ability of p53 to induce global chromatin relaxation (43).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	89	It is also worth considering what happens after DNA repair.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Clearly, there is a need to restore the chromatin to its original state of condensation, which will help protect the genome from incurring further damage.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The demonstration that p53 can induce global alterations in chromatin structure raised the possibility that p53 might influence histone modification on a global scale.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Focusing upon modification of histone H3 because of its central role in local and global chromatin remodelling (5 to 9,12), we compared the pattern of modification at specific residues of H3 in isogenic clones of human p53+/+ and p53 to / to  cells.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Since there is a general increase in histone acetylation following UV treatment (58) we were particularly interested to see whether other lysine residues of histone H3 in addition to K9 were similarly acetylated in response to UV irradiation.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In contrast to K9, levels of acetylated K18 of histone H3 did not change in response to UV-irradiation (59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	100	 However, p53 did facilitate a rise in acetylated K14 levels (59).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Our results demonstrate that p53, directly or indirectly, has site-specific effects on histone H3 acetylation in response to UV-irradiation and it will be interesting to see how these changes are mediated and if they contribute to p53-induced global chromatin relaxation for GGR.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	102	 With the recent advances in siRNA technology it should be possible to confirm the effects of p53 upon histone H3 modification already observed in isogenic clones of human p53+/+ and p53 to / to  cells.

0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	146	 A histone code exists with proteins able to distinguish between different modifications through modification-specific binding domains (such as chromo- and bromodomains) (71,72) and through a combinatorial approach even the same modification on different residues (4,12).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	147	 As the case of methylated K9 and K4 of histone H3 exemplifies, the same modification of different residues of the same histone cannot be presumed equivalent (6).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Clearly there is a need to define in detail the pattern of modification at specific genes.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	149	 For example, how does the pattern of histone modification differ between a gene repressed by p53 and a gene activated by p53? Is the effect of p53 on the pattern of histone modification the same for all genes that are transactivated by the tumour suppressor? Do the effects vary depending upon stress and how do they correlate with the pattern of gene expression, i.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	150	 choice between growth arrest or death? Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with engineered mutation of histones at selected sites (4) will prove invaluable in addressing such questions.
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	151	 For example, Thanos and co-workers have used a reconstituted in vitro transcription system with nucleosomal templates assembled with wild-type, mutant and modified histones to define the specific role of particular histone modifications in activation of the IFN-ss gene (4).
0.5641164.15231688.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The relationship between chromatin remodelling and p53 is a very worthwhile topic for investigation and may hold important insights into the multiplicity of p53 functions in mammalian cells.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Conclusion References   In the last decade, basic cancer research has produced remarkable advances in our understanding of cancer biology and cancer genetics.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Among the most important of these advances is the realization that apoptosis and the genes that control it have a profound effect on the malignant phenotype.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	5	 For example, it is now clear that some oncogenic mutations disrupt apoptosis, leading to tumor initiation, progression or metastasis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Conversely, compelling evidence indicates that other oncogenic changes promote apoptosis, thereby producing selective pressure to override apoptosis during multistage carcinogenesis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Finally, it is now well documented that most cytotoxic anticancer agents induce apoptosis, raising the intriguing possibility that defects in apoptotic programs contribute to treatment failure.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Because the same mutations that suppress apoptosis during tumor development also reduce treatment sensitivity, apoptosis provides a conceptual framework to link cancer genetics with cancer therapy.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	9	 An intense research effort is uncovering the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis such that, in the next decade, one envisions that this information will produce new strategies to exploit apoptosis for therapeutic benefit.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Conclusion References   Apoptosis was initially described by its morphological characteristics, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (1 to 3).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The realization that apoptosis is a gene-directed program has had profound implications for our understanding of developmental biology and tissue homeostasis, for it implies that cell numbers can be regulated by factors that influence cell survival as well as those that control proliferation and differentiation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Moreover, the genetic basis for apoptosis implies that cell death, like any other metabolic or developmental program, can be disrupted by mutation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In fact, defects in apoptotic pathways are now thought to contribute to a number of human diseases, ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to malignancy (4).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	17	The notion that apoptosis might influence the malignant phenotype goes back to the early 1970s.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Kinetic studies of tumor growth implied that cell loss from tumors could be massive; indeed, observed tumor growth rates could be  < 5% of that predicted from proliferation measurements alone (1,2).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In principle, changes in this `cell loss factor' could have a major impact on tumor growth or regression.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although most of this death was assumed to arise from necrosis a catastrophic (and easily discernible) type of cell death Kerr et al.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	21	 raised the possibility that a large percentage of cell loss from tumors was due to apoptosis (1).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Subsequent studies revealed a high frequency of apoptosis in spontaneously regressing tumors and in tumors treated with cytotoxic anticancer agents (3).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Together, these observations suggested that apoptosis contributed to the high rate of cell loss in malignant tumors and, moreover, could promote tumor progression.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Nevertheless, the importance of apoptosis in cancer remained under-appreciated for  > 15 years.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Conclusion References   The cloning and characterization of the bcl-2 oncogene established the importance of apoptosis in tumor development.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	28	 bcl-2 was first identified at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18) in a human leukemia line and was later shown to be a common event in follicular lymphoma (5,6).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	29	 At this time, oncogenes were classified as either `transforming' or `immortalizing' oncogenes based on their properties in rodent cell transformation assays.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, bcl-2 did not behave like a typical oncogene: instead of disrupting normal proliferation controls, Bcl-2 promoted cell survival by blocking programmed cell death (7 to 9).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, in transgenic mice, Bcl-2 overexpression promoted lymphoproliferation and accelerated c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis (8,10).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To date, at least 15 Bcl-2 family member proteins have been identified in mammalian cells, including proteins that promote apoptosis and those that prevent apoptosis (11).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL is a potent death suppressor that is upregulated in some tumor types (12).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Conversely, Bax is a death promoter that is inactivated in certain types of colon cancer and in hematopoietic malignancies (13,14).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	35	p53 was the first tumor suppressor gene linked to apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	36	 p53 mutations occur in the majority of human tumors and are often associated with advanced tumor stage and poor patient prognosis (15).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	37	 By 1992, p53 was clearly established as a checkpoint protein involved in cell-cycle arrest and maintaining genomic integrity following DNA damage.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, p53 could induce apoptosis when overexpressed in a myeloid leukemia cell line, suggesting that p53 might also regulate cell survival (16).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Studies using p53 knockout mice demonstrated that endogenous p53 could participate in apoptosis: p53 was required for radiation-induced cell death in the thymus, but not cell death induced by glucocorticoids or other apoptotic stimuli (17,18).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Hence, the role of p53 in apoptosis was indirectly linked to DNA damage and could be stimulus- (radiation) and tissue-specific (thymocytes).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	41	 It is now known that other stimuli can activate p53 to promote apoptosis, including hypoxia and mitogenic oncogenes (see below).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Moreover, several upstream and downstream components of the p53 pathway (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Mdm-2, ARF and Bax) are mutated in human tumors (15).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	44	Although the initial studies on Bcl-2 and p53 established the importance of apoptosis in carcinogenesis, it is now clear that mutations in many cancer-related genes can disrupt apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	45	 For example, the Fas/CD95 receptor normally controls cell numbers in the immune system by eliminating cells through apoptosis, and disruption of this pathway can lead to lymphoproliferative disorders and even cancers (19).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In addition, several signal transduction pathways promote cell survival in response to growth and/or survival factors, and these pathways may be crucial in controlling cell numbers in vivo.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	47	 One critical pathway involves signaling through PI-3 kinase (20), which can be activated by Ras and is downregulated by the PTEN tumor suppressor (21).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Ras activation and PTEN loss are common in human tumors.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	49	Studies using transgenic and knockout mice provide direct evidence that disruption of apoptosis can promote tumor development.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition to the lymphomas (10), bcl-2 transgenes accelerate SV40 large T antigen-induced mammary carcinogenesis (22).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Similarly, p53 loss produced by gene `knockout' accelerates tumor progression in many settings, including the murine retina, lens, choroid plexus and in the lymphoid compartment (23).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In many cases, p53 loss is associated with reduced apoptosis in situ.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Additionally, mouse studies reveal the crucial role of extracellular survival factors in supporting tumor progression.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For example, large T antigen-induced pancreatic tumors require the upregulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) for progression to carcinomas in fact, tumors arising in IGF-2 animals remain hyperplastic and display excessive apoptosis (24).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Moreover, inactivation of PTEN promotes tumorigenesis and cell survival when disrupted in mice (21), and disruption of the pro-apoptotic bax gene accelerates brain and mammary tumorigenesis in large T antigen transgenic mice (25,26).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	56	Because molecules that regulate apoptosis can have other activities, it is often difficult to demonstrate that mutations in tumors actually confer a survival advantage.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	57	 For example, p53 can promote apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and senescence such that loss of p53 function increases viability, chromosomal instability and cellular lifespan.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	58	 However, compelling evidence indicates its apoptotic activity is important in tumor suppression.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	59	 First, marked decreases in apoptosis correlate with the occurrence of p53 mutations in some transgenic mice (23) and in clonal progression of Wilms' tumor (27).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Second, disruption of several p53 effectors in apoptosis (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	61	 bax, apaf-1 and casp-9) can promote oncogenic transformation and tumor development in mouse model systems (25,28,29).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In colon cancer, bax and p53 mutations appear mutually exclusive, consistent with a pathway relationship (30).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In contrast, p21, which is essential for p53-mediated arrest, is rarely mutated in human tumors (31).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Finally, some tumor-derived p53 mutants remain capable of promoting cell-cycle arrest while losing their apoptotic potential (32,33).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Nevertheless, these data do not imply that the other p53 activities are dispensible for tumor suppression; rather, they simply argue that its apoptotic activity is important.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	66	What triggers apoptosis during tumor development? A variety of signals appear important.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Extracellular triggers include growth/survival factor depletion, hypoxia, radiation and loss of cell-matrix interactions.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Internal imbalances can also trigger apoptosis, including DNA damage (produced by cell-cycle checkpoint defects or exogenous toxins), telomere malfunction and inappropriate proliferative signals produced by oncogenic mutations.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In some instances the apoptotic `trigger' actually alleviates an anti-apoptotic signal.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For example, IGF-1 promotes cell survival through the PI-3 kinase pathway (34), and depletion of IGF-1 or other survival factors can trigger `death by default' (35).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In contrast, other stimuli involve true pro-apoptotic factors; as an example, many forms of cellular stress can activate p53, which promotes apoptosis through pro-apoptotic molecules like Bax (25,28,36).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	72	The identification of apoptotic `triggers' provides insight into the forces of tumor evolution (see also next section).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	73	 For example, in the skin, excessive exposure to UV radiation induces apoptosis, which presumably serves to eliminate heavily damaged cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	74	 UV radiation induces apoptosis, and loss of p53 function leads to the survival of these damaged cells thereby initiating tumor development (37).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Other apoptotic triggers are important in tumor progression.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	76	 As developing tumors outgrow their blood supply, they encounter hypoxia (low oxygen), which can activate p53 to promote apoptosis (38).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Cells acquiring apoptosis defects (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	78	 p53 mutations) can survive hypoxic stress, leading to their clonal expansion within the tumor (38).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Similarly, as developing tumor cells undergo repeated divisions, telomeres are shortened until some malfunction triggers either senescence or apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Like hypoxia, p53 is required for apoptosis induced by telomere malfunction; thus p53 mutant cells survive this response and are genomically unstable (39).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Indeed, suppression of the apoptotic response to telomere malfunction may explain why combined loss of telomerase and p53 stimulates tumor development (40).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	82	 These studies may explain why p53 mutations are usually late events in tumor development a cell acquiring a p53 mutation might not have a selective advantage until the developing tumor encounters hypoxic conditions or achieves sufficient telomere erosion.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	83	Disruption of apoptosis may also contribute to tumor metastasis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To metastasize, a tumor cell must acquire the ability to survive in the bloodstream and invade a foreign tissue.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Normally, this process is prevented by the propensity of epithelial cells to die in suspension, or in the absence of the appropriate tissue survival (41).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Clearly, the fact that these processes trigger apoptosis creates selective pressure to mutate apoptotic programs during tumor development.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Apoptosis in suspension is controlled by a number of other molecules, including the focal adhesion kinase and signal transduction pathways (42).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Some studies argue that p53 and Bcl-2 can also influence cell death in suspension (43), and others observe enrichment for p53 mutations or Bcl-2 overexpression in metastases (44,45).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Hence, loss of apoptosis can impact tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Conclusion References   Although the primary focus of this review is on the biology of apoptosis in cancer, much is known about the biochemical action of many apoptotic players, and key components are being assembled into pathways.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	93	 At the molecular level, the best understood cell death pathways involve those initiated by `death receptors`, including Fas/CD95, TNFR1, DR3, DR4 and DR5 (46).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Upon binding, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) trimerizes its ligand TNFR1 and results in the subsequent recruitment of the signal transducing molecules TRADD through conserved protein interaction regions known as `death domains'.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	95	 TRADD recruits RIP and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF-2), leading to activation of nuclear factor B (NF-B), which suppresses TNF--induced apoptosis (47).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	96	 While the recruitment of FADD by TRADD results in apoptosis through activation of a cell death protease, caspase-8.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Activated caspase-8 initiates a protease cascade that cleaves cellular targets and results in apoptotic cell death (46).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Hence, disruption of FADD can prevent activation of caspase-8, thereby producing defects in receptor-mediated cell death (48).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This pathway is rarely the target of oncogenic mutations, but, if anything, it is enhanced during tumor development (see below).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	100	Growth factors, cytokines and DNA damage appear to signal cell death through the mitochondria, and this pathway is the target of many oncogenic mutations.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These diverse signals affect the function of Bcl-2 family members which, in turn, can modulate the mitochondrial function though the permeability transition pore (PTP), a proposed channel evolved in mitochondria following necrotic or apoptotic signals.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The PTP is thought to be composed of clustered components of the mitochondrial membranes, including the voltage-dependent anion channel and adenine nucleotide translocator; and the opening of PTP results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (49).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Consistent with this idea, the crystal structure of Bcl-xL is reminiscent of pore-forming proteins of some bacterial toxins (50).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Enforced expression of the pro-apoptotic molecules Bax or Bak can result in increased mitochondria membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, which can be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 (51).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Cytosolic cytochrome c can interact with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 to initiate a protease cascade similar to that described above (52 to 54).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	106	As eluded to above, a series of enzymes known as caspases are considered the engine of apoptotic cell death.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Caspases are cysteine proteases that are expressed as inactive pro-enzymes, and can be broadly classified into `signaling' or `effector' caspases (55).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Signaling pro-caspases associate with specific adapter molecules that facilitate caspase activation by induced proximity (56 to 58).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	109	 For example, caspase-9 associates with Apaf-1, and oligomerization of this complex in the presence of cytochrome c can activate the downstream caspase cascade.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Other adapter/caspase complexes include FADD/caspase-8 and RAIDD/caspase-2 (46).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In mitochondrial pathways, most caspases act downstream of cytochrome c release, and some evidence suggests that disruption of caspases only delays cell death (59,60).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, in other circumstances, loss of these proteases produces pathological increases in cell numbers (29,61 to 65).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	113	 To date, little is known about the involvement of caspase mutations in cancers.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Nevertheless, disruption of Apaf-1 is associated with Noonan's Syndrome, caspase-10 mutations contribute to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome type II (65,66), and frameshift mutations in caspase-5 can occur in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers, gastrointestinal and endometrial tumors (67).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	115	Certain signal transduction pathways alter the probability with which pro-apoptotic signals induce apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	116	 For example, cytokines such as IL-6 can suppress p53-induced apoptosis in certain cell types (16).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Also, TNF--induced apoptosis is modulated by TRADD's ability to bind TRAF2, which facilitates NF-B-mediated cell survival (47,68).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Finally, PI-3 kinase pathway mediates cell survival signaling from extracellular cytokines receptors.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These receptors activate Ras and a kinase cascade involving PI-3 kinase and Akt leading to the ultimate phosphorylation and inactivation of pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAD and caspase-9 (69,70).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	120	 PTEN acts as a lipid phosphatase to inactivate 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, thereby downregulating this pathway (71,72).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Together, these studies imply that the ultimate decision to initiate apoptosis results from a complex integration of internal and external pro- and anti-apoptotic signals.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	122	Apoptotic programs cannot simply be described as two parallel programs converging on a common caspase machinery.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	123	 First, genetic studies using caspase-deficient mice demonstrate that the requirement for different death effector molecules during apoptosis is highly variable, being cell-type and stimulus specific (61 to 65).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Second, a large degree of `cross-talk' can exist between pathways.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	125	 For example, p53 can transactivate genes encoding death receptors (73).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Also, receptor-mediated activation of caspase-8 can cleave and activate BID, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that can facilitate cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (74,75).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Animal studies indicate that the caspase-8/BID pathway is highly cell-type dependent (76).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	128	 It is likely that more complexities will be identified; although confounding to the experimentalist, cell type and stimuli specificities provide avenues for designing selective therapeutics.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Conclusion References   Some oncogenic changes promote, rather than suppress apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Although this finding has ramifications for multistep carcinogenesis and cancer therapy (see below), the initial insights came from studies on adenovirus.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Adenovirus encodes several oncoproteins that, when expressed together, transform rodent cells (77).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The E1A oncoprotein induces quiescent cells to enter S phase (presumably to make the host cell permissive for virus replication) and, as a result, acts as a potent oncogene.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The E1B 19 and 55K oncoproteins are required for efficient virus replication and cooperate with E1A in transformation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Adenovirus mutants lacking the E1B 19K protein induce an E1A-dependent `cytocidal' phenotype that is associated with `degradation' of both viral and host-cell DNA (78,79).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	137	 As a result, E1B mutant adenoviruses produce poor virus yield.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Subsequent studies explained these puzzling observation: E1A induces apoptosis, and the E1B 19K oncoprotein acts like Bcl-2 to suppresses apoptosis (80).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In virus-infected cells, E1B prevents E1A-induced apoptosis, allowing viral replication to proceed.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This implies that apoptosis can act to counter virus replication and provides a biologic basis for cooperation between E1A and E1B in adenovirus transformation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	141	Studies on the c-myc oncogene highlight the importance of oncogene-induced apoptosis in human cancer (81).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In normal cells, ectopic c-Myc expression drives proliferation and prevents cell-cycle arrest upon serum withdrawal.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, while c-Myc-expressing cells continue to proliferate in low serum, cells do not accumulate because they die by apoptosis (82).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Importantly, survival factors such as IGF-1 can suppress c-Myc-induced cell death without producing substantial effects on c-Myc-induced proliferation (83).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The observation that c-Myc actively promotes apoptosis explains the potent cooperative effects observed between c-myc and bcl-2 in murine lymphomagenesis (10).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In fact, much like E1A and E1B, c-Myc cooperates with Bcl-2 to transform rodent fibroblasts (84,85).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The ability of c-Myc to cooperate with Bcl-2 in transformation could be viewed very much like E1A and E1B; Bcl-2 allows c-Myc-induced proliferation to proceed without apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	148	Why do some oncogenes promote apoptosis? Studies on c-Myc have been unable to separate its proliferative functions from those which promote apoptosis, implying that the processes are coupled (86).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Similarly, in normal fibroblasts, the ability of E1A to promote apoptosis depends on its ability to inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, and cannot be separated from its transforming functions (87).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, Rb loss leads to increased apoptosis in animal models (88,89), and reintroduction of Rb into cells lacking functional protein can suppress apoptosis (90).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Both E1A and loss of Rb deregulate the E2F transcription factors, and E2F-1 overexpression itself can induce apoptosis (91 to 93).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Hence, the pro-apoptotic activities of E1A and c-Myc appear directly or indirectly coupled to their hyperproliferative activity, implying that apoptosis acts as part of a cellular fail-safe mechanism to limit the consequences of aberrant mitogenic signaling.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	153	The critical involvement of p53 in oncogene-induced cell death underscores the importance of this response as a protective measure against oncogenic transformation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Although p53 is not required for normal apoptotic deaths during development, E1A can stabilize p53 protein (94), and p53-deficient cells are resistant to E1A-induced apoptosis (95,96).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	155	 p53 loss substitutes for the E1B proteins in promoting the growth, survival and transformation of E1A-expressing cells (95).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This implies that the primary function of the E1B proteins in adenovirus transformation is to circumvent this program.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	157	 c-Myc also induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (97,98).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In vivo, loss of p53 function can dramatically accelerate tumorigenesis induced by mitogenic oncogenes such as large T antigen, E7 and c-Myc, which is associated with decreased apoptosis in situ (99 to 102).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Importantly, in MMTV/c-myc transgenic mice, loss of p53 function accelerates thymic lymphoma but not mammary cancers, suggesting the involvement of p53-indepenedent mechanism.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Hence, oncogenes can induce apoptosis in both p53-dependent and -independent manners, depending on cellular context.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	161	Recent studies indicate that p19ARF acts as an essential intermediate in oncogene signaling to p53 (103).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	162	 For example, oncogenes such as E1A or c-myc induce ARF message and protein in normal mouse embryo fibroblasts, which correlates with their ability to activate p53 and promote apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Recently, ARF was shown to be a transcriptional target of c-Myc (104).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In contrast, these oncogenes fail to activate p53 in ARF-null cells, and promote proliferation without substantial apoptosis (105,106).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Together, these studies indicate that p19ARF acts as part of a p53-dependent fail-safe mechanism to counter hyperproliferative signals, and predict that disruption of ARF, or the INK4a/ARF locus, should cooperate with mitogenic oncogenes during tumor development.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Studies using c-myc transgenic mice support this view (102).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	167	One question is whether oncogenes directly induce apoptosis or `sensitize' the cell to various apoptotic stimuli.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Clearly, oncogenes can induce apoptosis directly if expressed at sufficient levels, and E1A-expressing cells possess an oncogene-generated activity capable of activating apoptosis in cell free systems (107).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	169	 However, cells stably expressing E1A or c-Myc are `sensitized' to diverse apoptotic stimuli, including serum depletion, DNA damaging agents, hypoxia, Fas, TNF- and other stimuli (81).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	170	 One target of oncogene-induced sensitization is the mitochondria.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Both E1A and c-Myc facilitate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and cytochrome c alone is sufficient to sensitize cells to diverse agents (107,108).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Oncogenes can facilitate cytochrome c release independently of p53 (108), although it is worth noting that p53 can induce Bax and proteins that affect mitochondrial function (109,110).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Hence, p53 may be involved in sensitization as well as active induction of cell death in oncogene-expressing cells (Figure 1).

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Oncogenes such as E1A and c-myc induce apoptosis through p53-dependent and independent pathways, and both pathways may facilitate cytochrome c release from mitochondria.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In any case, the Apaf-1/caspase-9 death effector complex appears important for oncogene-induced death.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Current evidence has not ruled out the possibility that oncogenes and/or p53 influence Apaf-1 and/or caspase-9 independent of cytochrome c, but this remains a possibility.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Components of the oncogene-induced cell-death program that are mutated in human tumors are shown in black, candidate tumor suppressors are shown in gray.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	179	  Caspase-9 and its adapter Apaf-1 are essential downstream components of p53 in oncogene-induced death (29).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Hence, disruption of either Apaf-1 or caspase-9 in fibroblasts prevents c-Myc-induced death without affecting p53 accumulation or activation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In fact, inactivation of either caspase-9 or apaf-1 completely substitutes for p53 loss in promoting the oncogenic transformation of cells by c-Myc and Ras (29).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Concordantly, Apaf-1 has been identified in cell free systems as an `oncogene-generated activity' important for apoptosis in E1A-expressing cells (107,111).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Because cytochrome c is an essential co-factor that is required for activation of the Apaf-1/caspase-9 protease complex, these studies suggest how oncogenes are linked to the effector phase of apoptosis (Figure 1).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Of note, several molecules that modulate oncogene-induced apoptosis are mutated in human tumors, and the data described above identify Apaf-1 and caspase-9 as candidate tumor suppressors (Figure 1).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	185	 However, to date, no mutations in either apaf-1 or caspase-9 have been described.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Perhaps these components act too late in the cell death program to provide a long-term survival advantage; alternatively, the mutational status of these genes may not have been thoroughly examined.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Until recently, most research into drug action focused on their intracellular targets, the nature of the cellular damage produced by the drug to target interaction, or resistance mechanisms that prevent the drug target interaction.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, in the 1970s pathologists noticed that radiation and chemotherapy can induce cell death with morphological features of apoptosis (112) (Figure 2), although the significance of these observations was not widely appreciated.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In particular, the premise that anticancer agents induce apoptotic cell death implies that cellular responses occurring after the drug to target interaction can have impact on drug-induced cell death (113 to 115).

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Massive apoptosis occurs in response to cyclophosphamide.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	198	  It is now well-established that anticancer agents induce apoptosis, and that disruption of apoptotic programs can reduce treatment sensitivity (116).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Since agents with distinct primary targets can induce apoptosis through similar mechanisms, mutations in apoptotic programs produce multi-drug resistance (113,117).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	200	 For example, many agents activate p53, and that p53 loss can attenuate drug-induced cell death (15).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Moreover, p53 mutations reduce therapy-induced apoptosis and tumor regression in experimentally generated and spontaneous murine tumors (102,118), whereas re-introduction of normal p53 to p53 mutant tumor lines and xenographs cooperates with chemotherapy to induce apoptosis and tumor regression (15,119).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	202	 p53 is not strictly required for drug-induced cell death; indeed, at sufficient doses virtually all anticancer agents induce apoptosis (and other types of death) independently of p53 (15).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In fact, the contribution of p53 to drug-induced apoptosis is determined by a variety of factors, including agent, dose, tissue and mutational background of the tumor (15,120,121).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In short-term assays, Bcl-2 can promote resistance to a wide range of anticancer agents (122,123) and can even prevent p53-independent deaths (124).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Because Bcl-2 is considered as a general apoptosis inhibitor, these results argue for the broad importance of apoptosis in treatment sensitivity.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Additionally, death receptor pathways may also contribute to therapy-induced apoptosis (125), although the relative contribution of these effects is controversial (126).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	207	In human cancer, the most compelling links between apoptosis and treatment sensitivity occur in patients with leukemia or lymphoma.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In these malignancies, p53 mutations correlate with short remissions and drug resistance following therapy (15).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Also, INK4a/ARF mutations, which reduce cyclophosphamide-induced death in murine lymphomas (102), are associated with poor treatment outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (127).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The extent to which apoptosis contributes to treatment sensitivity in carcinomas is less clear: whereas some studies identify striking correlations between p53 mutations and poor treatment response, others see no effect (116,128).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Few studies have associated Bcl-2 with drug resistance in patients and, in fact, high Bcl-2 levels may be a good prognostic indicator for breast cancer.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Finally, in some settings loss of Bcl-2 and p53 delays therapy-induced apoptosis but does not enhance long-term survival in clonogenic assays (128).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	213	What could explain these discrepancies? Though it is possible that apoptosis does not contribute to treatment sensitivity in solid tumors, some caveats are worth mentioning.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	214	 First, clinical studies typically examine single alterations (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	215	 p53 mutation) relying on detection methods that are not perfect and cannot exclude extragenic mutations in the same pathway (15,116).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This makes it virtually impossible to determine negative results.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	217	 As an example, murine lymphomas harboring INK4a/ARF mutations are chemoresistant, display defective p53 function, but retain wild-type p53 genes (102).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	218	 These tumors would be mistakenly classified as `p53 normal' by current technologies.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Secondly, while clonogenic survival is often considered the `gold-standard' of cytotoxicity assays, this readout does not always reflect the in vivo response (129).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is possible that extracellular survival factors influenced by cell density or microenvironment can affect drug-induced death (130).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	221	Anticancer agents induce apoptosis in normal tissues as well as in tumors.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In fact, many of the pathologists who identified apoptosis in tumors realized that apoptotic cell death was induced in a subset of normal tissues (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	223	 bone marrow and intestine), and it was suggested that the process might contribute to the `toxicity' associated with chemotherapy (112).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Studies using mouse models provide strong support for this idea.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	225	 For example, moderate doses of radiation and chemotherapy induce apoptosis in the murine thymus, spleen, bone marrow and intestine, the same tissues that account for the deleterious side-effects of chemotherapy.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, these tissues in p53 `knockout' mice display much reduced apoptosis and cell loss following radiation or chemotherapy (17,18,131 to 134), and these animals are resistant to otherwise lethal doses of ionizing radiation (135).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Similarly, ectopic expression of Bcl-2 in bone marrow cells achieves a similar effect (136).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Together, these studies strongly suggest that drug-induced apoptosis causes loss of normal cells and contributes to the side effects of cancer therapy.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Indeed, it is remarkable that the same genetic alterations that influence apoptosis during tumorigenesis also modulate treatment sensitivity.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	233	 For example, c-Myc enhances apoptosis in low concentrations of survival factors or oxygen and following treatment with diverse cytotoxic agents (38,82,137), conversely, loss of p53 and overexpression of Bcl-2 suppress apoptosis induced by oncogenes, depletion of survival factors, hypoxia and cytotoxic drugs (17,118,138).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	234	 As a result, anti-apoptotic mutations arising during the course of tumor development can simultaneously select for chemoresistant cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This pattern of co-selection may explain the phenomenon of de novo drug resistance, i.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	236	 tumors that initially respond poorly to therapy despite having never been selected in the presence of drug.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	237	Studies on c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis support directly link disruption of apoptosis during tumor development to de novo resistance (102).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In a mouse lymphoma model, INK4a/ARF or p53 mutations dramatically accelerate c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis, owing to a defect in oncogene-induced apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Moreover, these tumors respond poorly to therapy; whereas mice harboring tumors with an intact p53 pathway are cured, the vast majority harboring tumors with INK4a/ARF or p53 mutations relapse shortly after treatment.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This pattern of `resistance' is particularly common in advanced solid tumors.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These tumor-types probably encounter many `triggers' of apoptosis during tumor evolution (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	242	 survival factor depletion, hypoxia, loss of cell-matrix interactions), and it seems likely that one or more apoptotic programs must be lost to reach the malignant state.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Perhaps this explains why many advanced solid tumors are inherently difficult to treat.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In addition to cell death, other programmed responses contribute to the deletion of potentially cancerous cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Senescence is an irreversible program of cell-cycle arrest that is disrupted in many tumors or tumor-derived lines (139).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Replicative senescence was originally defined by the observation that primary cells have a genetically determined limit to their proliferative potential in cell culture, after which they permanently arrest with characteristic features.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Owing to the `end-replication problem', telomeres shorten during each cell division unless telomerase is expressed, and it is thought that some aspect of excessive telomere shortening activates cell-cycle arrest and other characteristics of senescence (139).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	251	 However, other stimuli can induce phenotypes suggestive of senescence, including mitogenic oncogenes and ionizing radiation (140 to 143).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	252	These observations imply that cellular senescence can be induced by diverse stimuli leading to the engagement of a common cell-cycle arrest program.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In this view, senescence is conceptually similar to apoptosis, which is induced by diverse stimuli leading to the engagement of a common cell death program.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Consequently, the biological roles of cellular senescence may go beyond the control of cellular or organismal aging, and reflect a global anti-proliferative response to a variety of cellular stresses.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In this view, senescence may represent an important form of programmed cellular `death' that limits tumor development.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Recent evidence suggests that anticancer agents induce cellular senescence in human tumor-derived lines treated in culture or as xenographs (144,145).

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	261	 As indicated above, many empirically derived cytotoxic drugs already may target apoptosis, albeit indirectly and non-exclusively.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	262	 They are also mutagenic and toxic to normal tissues.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In contrast, agents that directly induce apoptosis may provide less opportunity for acquired drug resistance, decrease mutagenesis and reduce toxicity.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Two observations suggest that such strategies are feasible.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	265	 First, most anti-apoptotic mutations act relatively upstream in the program (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	266	 PTEN and p53 loss; Ras and NF-B activation), implying that tumor cells retain the `machinery' and latent potential for apoptosis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Secondly, tumor-specific alterations in apoptotic programs provide opportunities to target cell death in a selective manner.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Several current strategies are discussed below.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	269	Targeting anti-apoptotic activities In instances where apoptosis is disabled by dominant oncogenes, agents that disrupt their anti-apoptotic function can produce remarkable increases in cell death.

0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Bcl-xS, a dominant-negative repressor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, can synergize with chemotherapy and promote tumor regression in xenographs (147,148), but produces minimal apoptosis when introduced into normal epithelial cells (149).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Some current anticancer agents may unwittingly target the Bcl-2 family; for example, taxanes may induce phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl-2 (150).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	274	 As more is learned about Bcl-2 structure and function, small molecule inhibitors of Bcl-2 action might become feasible.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	275	Hyperactivation of cell survival signaling may accompany tumor development, and these pathways are particularly exciting targets for small molecule inhibition.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	276	 NF-B activity can be induced by oncogenes or anticancer agents to promote cell survival, such that inactivating NF-B enhances cell death in response to tumor necrosis factor and certain chemotherapeutic agents (151).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In fact, inhibiting NF-B activity using I-B or proteosome inhibitors synergizes with radiation and chemotherapy to induce cell death in tumor lines and xenographs (152,153).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway involves a series of enzymes that transit the survival signals.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In principle, small molecule inhibition of any of these molecules might restore apoptosis to tumor cells, or synergize with more classic agents to induce cell death (154).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	280	Oncogenic ras mutations deregulate normal growth control but can also signal cell survival (34).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Therefore, agents that interfere with Ras function might be cytostatic or cytotoxic.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	282	 To be biologically active, Ras must be modified by a farnysltransferase, and many groups have developed farnysltransferase inhibitors as anti-tumor agents.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Although these agents were predicted to be cytostatic, they can induce massive apoptosis and tumor regression of mammary carcinomas arising in ras transgenic mice (120).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In addition, inhibition of Ras-GAP induces apoptosis specifically in tumor, but not in normal cells, suggesting Ras-GAP as a novel target for cancer therapy (155).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Why would these agents induce apoptosis and, moreover, why would they be selective? The answer is unknown, but it is possible that tumor cells become dependent on survival signaling through the PI-3 kinase pathway, which could be suppressed by Ras inhibition.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	286	Restoring pro-apoptotic activities In circumstances where apoptosis is lost by a recessive mutation, restoring the dysfunctional gene or activity can promote massive cell death.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	287	 For example, reintroduction of p53 into p53 mutant tumor cells can directly induce apoptosis or enhance treatment sensitivity in tumor cell lines or in xenographs (156,157).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Indeed, strategies using this approach are currently in clinical trials (158).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	289	 As a general rule, tumor cells are inherently more sensitive to p53 inhibition than normal cells, perhaps because mitogenic oncogenes can activate p53 to promote apoptosis (117).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Hence, there is some rationale for selectivity of this approach.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Of note, strategies to counter recessive anti-apoptotic mutations need not rely on gene or protein therapy.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In some instances, inactivation of a pro-apoptotic gene might actually promote cell survival by relieving inhibition of a downstream death suppressor (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In such instances, the downstream effector may be a more suitable drug target (154).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	294	Death ligands Although mutations in death receptors are rare events in human tumors, changes accompanying tumorigenesis can alter the regulation of these pathways.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Mitogenic oncogenes like c-myc and E1A can increase sensitivity to Fas and TNF- in cultured cells (159,160), and many human tumors have alterations in TRAIL-mediated death pathways (19).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	296	 TRAIL is a TNF-related protein that initiates p53-independent apoptosis by binding to its receptors DR4 or DR5.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Normal cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, apparently because these cells express `decoy' receptors that compete with DR4 and DR5 for TRAIL but do not transmit a death-inducing signal (161,162).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Through an unknown mechanism, the expression of the decoy receptor 1 seems to be widely lost on tumor cells, making them exquisitely susceptible to TRAIL-mediated cell death.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Because DR5 is a p53-responsive gene, combination therapy with TRAIL and classic cytotoxic agents may be particularly effective in treating tumors with functional p53 (73).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	300	A conceptually related strategy for selective tumor-cell killing involves a viral protein known as `apoptin', the VP3 product of chicken anemia virus (CAV).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This protein is responsible for the cytopathic effects of CAV (163) and induces apoptosis in tumor cells but not normal cells (164).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, apoptin-induced apoptosis is independent of p53 and is enhanced by Bcl-2 (165,166).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	303	 At the very least, the remarkable effects of apoptin underscore the point that selective induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is achievable.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	304	Enhancing the effects of pro-apoptotic mutations Basic studies suggest that it is possible to directly harness the pro-apoptotic forces produced by certain oncogenic mutations to selectively kill tumor cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	305	 As mentioned earlier, oncogenes like c-myc and inactivation of tumor suppressors such as Rb force proliferation but at the same time promote apoptosis, presumably as a cellular safe-guard against tumorigenesis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In normal cells, E1A promotes apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity through a dual mechanism that involves inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein and binding the p300/CBP transcription co-activators.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	307	 As a result, E1A mutants unable to bind Rb (but retaining the p300/CBP interaction) promote apoptosis in Rb-deficient cells but not normal cells (87).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In principle, these E1A mutants, or small molecules which mimic their action, may provide tumor-specific anticancer agents by exploiting the fact that the Rb pathway is disrupted in the majority of human cancers.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	309	Rb mutations lead to increased E2F activity, and this promotes both proliferation and apoptosis (91 to 93).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Whereas Rb represses E2F activity during G0/G1, cdk2 kinase can repress E2F activity during S phase (167).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	311	 It has been suggested that simultaneous inactivation of Rb and cdk2 would be particularly pro-apoptotic, and produce a synthetic lethal effect in cells with a mutant Rb pathway (168).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Consistent with this hypothesis, cell-permeable peptides that interfere with cdk2 activity readily induce apoptosis in tumor cells while having little effect on normal cell lines (168).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Interestingly, although E2F-induced apoptosis is potentiated by p53 (91), these peptides can induce apoptosis in p53-deficient tumor cell lines.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Therefore, this strategy has widespread potential.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	315	Chemoprotection As indicated above, the propensity of certain tissues (e.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	316	 bone marrow and intestine) to drug-induced apoptosis may limit the effectiveness of many current therapies.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Studies using mouse models have clearly documented the importance of p53 for apoptosis in thymocytes, bone marrow and intestinal stem cells (see above); consequently, agents which suppress p53 function may be effective radio- or chemoprotective agents and/or allow dose intensification of current regimens.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Since most advanced solid tumors have lost p53 function, these inhibitors should not interfere with cell death of most tumor cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Recently, a small molecule (designated pifithrin-) has been identified that inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional responses and p53-induced apoptosis in cultured cells (169).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	320	 In mice, pifithrin- is a potent radioprotective agent; pifithrin- treated mice survive otherwise lethal doses of ionizing radiation.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	321	Several caveats exist with respect to p53 inhibition in patients.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	322	 First, the premise is based on animal studies, and it is not yet known the extent to which p53 contributes to anticancer agent toxicity in humans.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Secondly, although the protective effects in mice are striking, the magnitude of the protective effect over repeated doses and time is unknown.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Thirdly, p53 inhibition may promote mutations by allowing the survival of mutated cells.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This is clearly a concern, since p53 `knockout' mice are extremely sensitive to radiation-induced carcinogenesis.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	326	 However, transient inhibition of p53 may be less mutagenic (169).
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	327	 In any case, most current anticancer agents are directly mutagenic, and it is not clear whether p53 inhibitors (which would only indirectly promote mutations) would be worse.
0.53721935.10688869.html.plaintext.txt	328	 At the very least, this strategy warrants further consideration.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 protein plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Several compounds have been reported to restore wild type function to mutant p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	8	 One such compound, CP-31398, has been shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We also show the compound restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Using a quantitative DNA binding assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant p53 that binds to cognate DNA (Bmax) and its affinity (Kd) for DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The compound, however, does not affect the affinity (Kd value) of wild type p53 for DNA and only increases Bmax slightly.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We also show that CP-31398 had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein belongs to a superfamily of transcription factors that includes its homologs p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	17	 p53 is involved in a wide range of cellular activities that help ensure the stability of the genome, whereas p63 and p73 are involved in ectodermal morphogenesis, limb morphogenesis, neurogenesis, and homeostatic control and are not considered tumor suppressor genes (1).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	18	 p53 is involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis via transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these activities or by direct interaction with other proteins (2 to 4).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutations that inactivate p53 are present in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of aggressive cancers that are difficult to treat by chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (2, 5).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	20	The majority of inactivating mutations reside in the central core DNA binding domain (DBD)1 of p53 (2, 5).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These mutations can be divided into two main classes, DNA contact mutants, like R273H, where the mutation alters a residue involved in contact with DNA, and structural mutants, like R249S, which result in structural changes in the p53 core domain (6 to 8).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These mutations affect the function of p53 by distorting the structure and reducing the thermal stability of the protein (6 to 8).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This can alter the ability of p53 to bind to various p53 response elements in a variety of genes, hampering its transcriptional regulation (9).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, these mutations may alter p53 structure, so that p53 can no longer induce apoptosis by binding to BclXL, thereby inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function (10).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	25	One potential therapeutic approach to cancer would be restoration of growth suppression activity to mutant p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Several approaches have been tried, ranging from micro-injection of monoclonal antibody 421, C-terminal peptide of p53 and small molecules (11 to 16).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recently, small molecules and peptides, such as CP-31398, PRIMA1, and CDB3 peptide, have been shown to be effective in restoring p53 function (17 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Both PRIMA1 and CDB3 have been shown to restore p53 DNA-binding activity in vitro (18 to 21), whereas the effects for CP-31398 have been shown primarily in cell-based assays (17, 22 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Both CP-31398 and PRIMA1 have been shown to reduce tumor size in animal models (17, 18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It is postulated that the two molecules perform similar tasks, but by different mechanisms.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	31	 PRIMA1 has been suggested to work more broadly to restore p53 DNA-binding activity, but the specific mechanism is not known (18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	32	 CP-31398, on the other hand, has been suggested to stabilize p53 as a protectant against thermal denaturation and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (17).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Recently, CP-31398 has also been shown to stabilize wild type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (23).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Reports from other studies suggest that CP-31398 interacts with DNA and not with p53 in vitro, and it is proposed to act as a DNA-damaging agent (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Although it has been shown that the effects of CP-31398 on p53 do not depend on the DNA damage pathway (23), its p53-independent cellular growth suppression effects at higher concentrations and lack of demonstrated binding to p53 protein raise confusion about its mechanism of action (24 to 26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Here we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote mutant p53 to bind to p53 response elements in vivo using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition, using purified p53 core domain, we clearly demonstrate that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We also show that CP-31398 does not have any effects on the DNA-binding activity of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In contrast, PRIMA1 was ineffective in restoring DNA-binding activity to isolated mutant p53 DNA binding domain.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We treated both H1299 cells, which are p53-null cells, and SkBr3 tumor cells, which have the p53 mutation R175H, with or without 2.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The H1299 cells show no apoptosis effect when treated with CP-31398 and are similar to the untreated H1299 cells.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Previous reports (22 to 25) have shown that CP-31398 can induce p53-mediated apoptosis in mutant p53 tumor cells and that it has maximal effectiveness at 10  microg/ml, which is the concentration that we used in subsequent experiments.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	137	  Because the effect of CP-31398 seems to be dependent upon the presence of p53, we treated WiDr cells, a colon tumor cell line that harbors an R273H hotspot mutation, with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, and then made a nuclear extract, which we then used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a consensus p53 DNA binding site (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	138	 1B) to see if CP-31398 could restore sequence-specific binding to mutant p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Treatment with CP-31398 causes a shift of labeled probe that can be competed away with unlabeled p53 consensus oligonucleotide, in the CP-31398-treated nuclear extract, whereas no such band occurs in the untreated extract, indicating that the compound was capable of inducing mutant p53 to bind p53-specific DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	140	 To further demonstrate that the effect of CP-31398 was specific for p53-responsive genes, we treated WiDr cells with 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, then made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, bax, p21, and actin.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Treatment with CP-31398 did not alter the level of either p53 or actin, but it significantly increased the level of both p21 and bax (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In addition, we transiently transfected WiDr cells either with pSuper-p53, which encodes p53 SiRNA, or with the control empty vector, pSuper, then treated transfected cells with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, actin, p21, and bax.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The cells transfected with pSuper behaved similarly to the untransfected WiDr cells (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The level of p53 and actin were unaltered, but there was a significant increase in the levels of both p21 and bax in the presence of CP-31398.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	145	 With the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, actin levels were unaffected, but p53 levels were significantly decreased with or without CP-31398 (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In addition, there was no induction of p21 or bax in the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, indicating that the effects of CP-31398 were dependent on the presence of p53.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	147	To prove that the induction of bax and p21 was due to promoter binding of mutant p53 reactivated by CP-31398 in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in WiDr cells treated with either 0 or 10  microg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Treatment with CP-31398 specifically increased the amount of both p21 and bax promoter DNA that was immunoprecipitated with p53-specific antibody DO1, whereas there was no increase in the amount of ribosomal protein S9 promoter DNA, whose promoter does not have a p53 response element.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This indicates that the effect of CP-31398 is specific for p53 and promotes the reactivation of full-length mutant p53 into functional "wild type" p53, which is fully capable of binding DNA in vivo.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	150	Characterization of CP-31398 Effects on p53 in Vitro Given that CP-31398 appears to be capable of restoring DNA-binding activity to full-length mutant p53 in vivo, we wanted to see if CP-31398 would be equally effective in a system using purified protein, free of any potential cellular contaminants.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Previous reports (19) have indicated that CP-31398 protects the DNA binding domain of p53 from thermo-denaturation in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	152	 We then cloned and expressed the DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 as GST fusion proteins (Fig.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Binding was measured in the presence or absence of 500 nM C-terminal peptide or 500 nM CP-31398.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Both the peptide and CP-31398 caused specific binding to the consensus oligonucleotide, whereas no binding was seen with the altered oligonucleotide or in the absence of compound or peptide.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Next, we titrated various concentrations of CP-31398 with the mutant protein (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Binding of the protein to the labeled oligonucleotide was very low in the absence of compound.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	171	 As the compound was increased up to 1  microM, there is an increase in binding activity, demonstrating that CP-31398 can dose dependently restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain in an in vitro system.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The apparent difference between the concentration used in vivo and the concentration used in vitro is possibly due to the unstable nature of CP-31398 (26), which can not be stored in solution at room temperature for an extended period.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	173	Quantitation of CP-31398 Effects on p53 in Vitro To quantitate the effects of CP-31398 on p53, we have developed a quantitative DNA binding assay based upon an IGEN electro-chemiluminescence detection system, which captures a biotinylated oligonucleotide on a streptavidin-coated magnetic bead.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	174	 If protein is bound to the captured oligonucleotide, it is detected using an antibody specific to the protein, followed by a secondary antibody labeled with ruthenium.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The advantage of the electro-chemiluminescent system is that it is significantly more sensitive than an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and is capable of generating a more robust signal that helps to detect weak interactions.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	176	The assay was validated using GST-His p53DBD wt and a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus binding sequence (Fig.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Because CP-31398 was discovered in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based conformation stabilization assay using recombinant wild type p53 DNA binding domain (17), we wanted to see if CP-31398 had any effect on DNA-binding activity of wild type p53 core protein.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	182	 We assayed wild type p53 at 5 nM protein in the absence and presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (Fig.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 both mutants showed a dramatic increase in DNA binding, with the Bmax (R273H: 8890  plus or minus  1242 alone versus 108,047  plus or minus  8309 with CP-31398; R249S: 8031  plus or minus  739 alone versus 133,187  plus or minus  12,614 with CP-31398) increasing severalfold.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	199	  To see if this effect was specific for the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence, the p53 DNA binding site from the Bax promoter was substituted for the consensus site in the assay.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The p53 binding site in the Bax promoter (referred to as the bax site) has been reported to have a lower affinity for p53, and it binds p53 to a much lesser extent than the consensus binding sequence (9, 29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	201	 First we confirmed the effect of CP-31398 on wild type protein using the bax site (Fig.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	202	 As with the consensus DNA the affinity of wild type p53 (Kd) for the bax site did not change in the presence of 500 nM CP-31398 (106.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	203	71 with CP-31398), but the Bmax did (224,602  plus or minus  19,026 alone versus 353,797  plus or minus  26,649 with CP-31398).

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	214	  Effects of CP-31398 on p63 and p73 One potential issue with CP-31398 is that it tends to be cytotoxic at doses over 15  microg/ml in a p53-independent manner (17, 23 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Part of this cytotoxicity could be due to effects on the p53 homologs, p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	216	 To see if CP-31398 had any effect on p63 or p73, we cloned and expressed the DNA binding domains of both proteins as GST fusions (29) (Fig.

0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	231	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Restoration of wild type function to mutant p53 has recently become a viable and interesting approach for developing cancer therapeutics as more is understood about the mutational defects in p53 protein (2, 4).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Recently, several compounds and peptides have been reported to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53 in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Two of these compounds, CP-31398 and PRIMA1, have been effective in reducing tumor size in animal models (17, 18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	234	 CP-31398 was discovered in a random screen of small molecules for their ability to protect wild type conformation (monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope) of p53 core domain from thermal denaturation (17).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It has been suggested that p53 is a dynamic protein, an equilibrium exists between conformations, and mutation shifts the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation, promoting thermal denaturation at physiological temperature (6 to 8, 20).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Oncogenic mutations change the conformation of core domain thus abolishing binding with cognate DNA molecules (31).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Lack of evidence of direct interaction of CP-31398 with p53 core domain and controversy about the potential mechanism of action of this promising class of molecules prompted us to biochemically characterize its effects on DNA-binding activity of wild type and mutant p53 core domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	238	Here we show that CP-31398 can promote p53-mediated apoptosis and induce the expression of p53-specific genes such as p21 and bax in cells with mutant p53 in a similar fashion as has been reported (22 to 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	239	 We also show that CP-31398 has the ability to restore sequence-specific DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in the compound-treated nuclear extract in vitro in a manner similar to previous reports (25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In addition, using a ChIP assay, we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote the binding of mutant p53 to the response elements in p53-regulated genes in cells.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The binding of p53 to both p21 and bax promoter, and the failure of p53 to bind the S9 ribosomal protein promoter, indicate that CP-31398 interacts specifically with p53, and not DNA as had been previously suggested (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	242	 CP-31398 can functionally restore mutant p53 to make capable of acting like wild type p53 and interact with both high (p21) and low (bax) affinity promoters (9, 30).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The relatively high concentrations of CP-31398 needed for cellular experiments reported here and elsewhere (22 to 26) are indicative of a possible unstable nature of CP-31398 (26).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	244	Our studies with the purified p53 DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 clearly show that CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 core domain by increasing both Bmax and Kd values of the reaction.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Interestingly, the compound stimulates the DNA-binding activity of wild type protein without having any effects on affinity for DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	246	 With the wild type protein, Bmax is increased (1.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	247	5-fold) but the Kd remains the same in the presence of the compound, whereas with both R273H and R249S mutants, Bmax is more greatly increased than Kd ( > 10-fold).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This indicates that CP-31398 acts as a "non-competitive agonist," binding to the proteins, and alters the rate of the reaction and the amount of protein capable of binding to DNA, but not affecting the affinity of the protein for DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Such a result suggests an allosteric mechanism, where binding of the compound to a site away from the protein-DNA interface can cause the protein to be placed into a conformation capable of binding DNA (32).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	250	 As with CDB3, CP-31398 affects mutant protein binding to DNA in a similar way bringing the Kd of the mutant p53 for DNA to a similar level as wild type.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The variations in the effect are mainly due to the affinity of the individual mutants for the particular p53 DNA binding site.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	252	 R273H, which maintains a nearly wild type conformation, has the ability to transactivate from a consensus p53 DNA binding site but has a much reduced ability to transactivate and bind other sites like bax that have a much lower affinity for p53 than the consensus sequence (7 to 9).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	253	This non-competitive allosteric activation fits into the model suggested by Freidler et al.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	254	 (20), where CP-31398, like CDB3 peptide, functions as a chaperone, enables p53 to fold into an active conformation that is capable of binding DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	255	 What occurs after DNA binding is a source of speculation.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	256	 By Freidler's model (20), the compound should be displaced by the structural rearrangement that p53 undergoes once it binds DNA.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	257	 (33) has shown that CDB3 binds to wild type and mutant (R249S and R273H) in the same manner, at a site that is away from the protein-DNA interface, and away from the site distorted by the R249S mutation.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Thus, CDB3 exerting its effect via a long range conformational change and binding to a site that is different than the natural ligand, DNA, is an allosteric mechanism.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	259	In addition, CP-31398 has been shown to inhibit MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, possibly by blocking Mdm2 interaction with the core domain of p53 (23, 25).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Because binding of Mdm2 to the N terminus of p53 causes a conformational rearrangement of p53 and allows for access to its core domain, CP-31398 may prevent such rearrangements.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In addition, maintenance of wild type conformation may promote binding of the p53 core domain to BclXL (10).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	262	The major difference between CP-31398, CDB3, and PRIMA1, is that PRIMA1 seems not to bind to p53 core domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In our assay, PRIMA1 fails to stimulate DNA binding with just the DNA binding domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Others have reported that PRIMA1 only works with full-length protein and fails to interact with the DNA binding domain (18, 21).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	265	 A recent report (34) showed that PRIMA1 could induce apoptosis in the absence of new protein synthesis.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This suggests that compounds that alter the active conformation of p53 and turn it into a more wild type protein may also exert their influence by making p53 capable of interacting with BclXL and BH3 domain-containing proteins to help mediate mitochondrial depolarization (10, 34, and 35).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Given the nature of p53, it is likely that binding somewhere other than the DNA binding domain could exert effects on the DNA binding domain.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It has been suggested that binding occurs just outside of the DNA binding domain or in the tetramerization domain (18).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	269	 One possible effect is that it could promote and stabilize p53 tetramers in a conformation that is sufficient for the protein to function in DNA binding or in mitochondrial depolarization.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	270	CP-31398 and CDB3 appear to be more specific for p53 than p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Both p63 and p73 have homologous DNA binding domains as p53, but there are some amino acid differences between the proteins (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	272	 A comparison between models of p53 DNA binding domain and p63 DNA binding domain indicates that p63 has a more thermostable hydrophobic core, making the protein significantly more stable than p53 (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This is apparent from the fact that p63 and p73 protein can be expressed in soluble form at relatively high temperatures compared with p53 (29).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Interestingly, there are second site suppressor mutations that can restore DNA-binding activity to some oncogenic mutants of p53 (36 to 38).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Recently, a crystal structure of a quadruple mutant of p53 provides an explanation how loss of hydrogen bonds in V143A, a temperature-sensitive mutant, can be compensated by second site mutation N268D.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The suppressor mutation N268D not only increases the overall stability of the oncogenic mutant but also induces local change to the protein initially caused by the loss of two methyl groups of V143A (38).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	277	 This is a possible mechanism for compounds like CP-31398 and CDB3.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Their interaction with the p53 core may provide energetically favorable compensatory hydrogen bonds and increase overall stability of many oncogenic mutants and, by doing so, restore wild type function.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Given that the hydrophobic cores of p63 and p73 are stable, there may not be a site where the compounds can bind and act to give additional stability.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	280	We have shown that CP-31398 can affect the DNA-binding activity of both wild type and mutant p53 in vivo and in vitro.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	281	 We also have observed that DNA binding is restored to both DNA contact mutant (R273H) and structural mutant (R249S) by the compound, and the effect is more pronounced in a structural mutant (R249S).
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These effects seem to be specific to p53, because both CP-31398 and CDB3 do not affect the activity of p63 and p73.
0.4980571.15308639.html.plaintext.txt	283	 By developing a DNA binding assay with CP-31398 and mutant p53, we can potentially look for compounds that perform similar activities to CP-31398 and CDB3 but do not have the liabilities and side effects of these molecules.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	4	   Abstract Top Abstract References   Recent studies have suggested that the straightforward role of p53 as a transcription factor that functions by inducing apoptotic target genes to eliminate developing tumor cells is only part of a much more complicated story.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	5	 There is now a firm body of evidence supporting a transcriptionally independent activity of p53 as a functional, if not structural, homologue of the BH3-only proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Although this information adds another nuance to the mechanism by which p53 can induce apoptosis, further studies indicate that the apoptotic function of p53 represents only a part of its tumor suppressive activity.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although complicating our understanding of p53, these new insights may also provide some exciting new targets for the design of therapeutics that can reactivate p53 in cancers.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	8	The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes one of the most intensively studied proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This interest in p53 is engendered not by an essential role for p53 during normal growth and development, but by the contribution of p53 to tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Loss or alterations in the function of p53 have been found in most human cancers, including the major epithelial malignancies that may soon be responsible for most deaths in the Western world (1,2).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Understanding and treating these cancers has become a matter of some urgency, and the p53 pathway is an attractive candidate for the development of targeted cancer therapies.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	12	 But can such therapies be successfully developed? Compared with the kinases, the most popular and successful cancer drug targets to date, p53 remains a more elusive quarry.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Many functions have been ascribed to p53 that relate to activities as diverse as transcriptional activation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, exonuclease activity, DNA repair and regulation of angiogenesis (3 to 6).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The ability of p53 to signal a variety of growth inhibitory responses, including the induction of cell-cycle arrest, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis (7,8), establish a central role for p53 as a master regulator of tumor suppression (9).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, despite the efforts of many researchers over many years, the relative contributions of these activities to tumor suppression remain hotly disputed.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Over the past few years even the most unassailable  truths  about p53 have been called into question, leaving us with the uncomfortable feeling that the more we learn, the less we know.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Two examples of reasonably well-established facts about p53 that have recently become more complicated are the importance of p53 as a transcription factor and the role of apoptosis in tumor suppression, each of which we will discuss briefly in this review.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	18	Of all the activities of p53, none is more firmly accepted than the function of p53 as a transcription factor (10 to 12).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Assembling into a tetramer, p53 shows sequence specific DNA binding activity through its central domain (Figure 1), and activates the expression of genes that contain p53 binding sites in their promoters by virtue of interactions of the N-terminal domain of p53 with the transcriptional machinery.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Almost all tumor derived p53 mutants contain a point mutation within the DNA binding domain that prevents, or in some cases alters, the recognition of p53 binding sites.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In general, p53 mutants expressed in tumors lose the ability to activate expression of the target genes that are responsive to wild-type p53 although they may acquire unique transcriptional activities not shared by the wild-type protein and this by itself suggests that the transcriptional function of p53 is likely to be important for tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Identification of target genes that are activated by p53 has further supported this concept; of the hundreds of p53-inducible target genes that have been identified so far there is compelling evidence that several of these play a role in mediating the various downstream responses to p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was amongst the first of the p53 targets to be identified, and deletion of p21Waf1/Cip1 in a number of cell systems strongly abrogates the ability of p53 to induce a G1 cell-cycle arrest (13,14).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	24	 More recently, the products of other transcriptional targets of p53 have been shown to play a role in mediating various p53 responses, including a large group of genes encoding proteins with apoptotic activity (3).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Analysis of a number of these genes indicated that knocking out any one individually failed to protect the cells completely from p53-induced death, suggesting that the response reflects the combined effect of a number of targets.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, more recently, the BH3 domain protein PUMA has emerged as a promising candidate for a key p53-inducible apoptotic target (15,16).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	27	 PUMA was shown to be critical for p53-mediated cell death in a number of cells and tissues, with knock-out or knock-down of PUMA resulting in a severely impeded to apoptosis (17,18) and in some models, enhancing tumor development (19).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, given the all-or-nothing threshold nature of the apoptotic response, it seems unwise to conclude that PUMA is the be-all and end-all to p53-induced apoptosis.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Indeed, it is clear that in some cells types inactivation of other p53 target genes, like NOXA, has an equally profound effect on the apoptotic response (18,20).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Taken together, it seems most likely that the coordinated activity of many of the p53-inducible apoptotic target genes will play a key role in governing the life and death decision in response to stresses that activate p53.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Diagram showing the domain structure of the p53 protein.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The p53 protein is a transcription factor that contains several well-defined domains.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At the N-terminus are the transactivation domain and a proline-rich region, which is required for apoptotic function.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Within the N-terminus are the interaction sites of p53 with components of the transcriptional machinery as well as ubiquitin ligase Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The central domain harbors the sequence specific DNA binding region, where most of the tumor associated mutations occur.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This central region also contains binding sites for interaction with members of the Bcl2 protein family.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The C-terminal region contains the oligomerization domain as well as nuclear localisation and export signals.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Several sites within the N-terminal region have been shown to be phosphorylated and the C-terminal region contains numerous sites of modification which influence stability, localization and activity of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	40	  Despite the strong evidence supporting the role of p53 as a transcription factor, there has been consistent debate over whether p53 may also have transcriptionally independent activities.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Certainly, p53 also shows transcriptional repressor functions that are strongly correlated with apoptosis (21 to 23).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, a number of early studies suggested that p53 may have an apoptotic function that is completely separate from the regulation of gene expression (24 to 27).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	43	 An explanation for this activity has been provided very recently with the observation that following stress, a proportion of p53 appears to function outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm or at the mitochondria, and that p53 can be found in association with several members of the Bcl2 family of proteins (28).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The Bcl2 related proteins are the key components of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and fall into three main groups; those that can function to perturb mitochondrial membrane potential directly (Bax and Bak), the BH3-only proteins that directly or indirectly drive the activation of Bax and Bak, and the anti-apoptotic proteins that sequester pro-apoptotic family members and hold them inactive (such as Bcl2, BclxL and Mcl1).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The BH3-only proteins are further divided into two groups; those that bind Bax and Bak directly to activate them (the  activators , such as Bim and Bid) and those that bind the anti-apoptotic family members to release the activators (the  enablers  like Bad and Bik) (29,30) (Figure 2).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Unexpectedly, it would seem that p53 can function in a manner analogous to the BH3-only proteins, with evidence to support two broad, but not mutually exclusive, models.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In the first, p53 functions like an  enabler  BH3 domain protein, interacting with the anti-apoptotic proteins and presumably releasing pro-apoptotic BH3 domain proteins to drive apoptosis (Figure 2A and B) (31).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The second model is based on the recent observation that p53 can function in a manner more analogous to the  activator  BH3-only proteins, by directly activating the apoptotic function of Bax or Bak (Figure 2C and D) (32,33).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In either case, the remarkable parallels in the function between p53 and the BH3-only proteins is not reflected by any obvious amino acid sequence similarity, although it is possible that parts of p53 adopt a similar structure to the BH3 domain.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Interestingly, however, mutations in the DNA binding domain of p53 that are frequently found in tumors also prevent the interaction of p53 with BclxL (31), indicating that the loss of apoptotic activity of these mutants may derive from the concomitant failure to induce transcription and loss of this mitochondrial activity.

0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	53	 On the left, two possible roles for p53 as an  enabler  type BH3-only protein.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In these models p53 is able to disrupt the interaction between anti-apoptotic proteins (such as BclxL, Bcl2 and Mcl1) and pro-apoptotic proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This could directly relieve the inhibition of Bax and Bak (A), or free  activator  type BH3 only proteins (Bid and Bim), which can then activate Bax and Bak (B).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	56	 On the right, models in which p53 functions as an  activator  type BH3-only protein.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Activation of Bax and Bak might involve binding and releasing them from interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins (C).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Alternatively, p53 itself may be held inactive by interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In this case it is possible that other  enabler  BH3-only proteins like PUMA might be able to displace p53 from the anti-apoptotic proteins, thus allowing it to activate Bax/Bak (D).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Note that although there is evidence to support each of the models, not all the interactions indicated in the Figure have been confirmed.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	61	  Although in experimental systems the mitochondrial activity of p53 alone can be sufficient for cell death, it seems likely that under physiological conditions this function will cooperate with the ability of p53 to activate transcription of genes like PUMA to drive a full apoptotic response.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Although it is possible that PUMA and mitochondrial p53 activate independent apoptotic signals that combine to push the cell over an apoptotic threshold, it is interesting to consider a closer relationship between these two p53 activities.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	63	 One possibility is that the accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is an immediate response to stress, sensitizing the cells to further apoptotic signals like the expression of PUMA.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Recent studies have shown that in mice subjected to DNA damage treatment, a rapid p53 mitochondrial translocation (which precedes p53 target gene activation) triggers an early wave of apoptosis, which is followed later by a second wave that is transcription dependent (34).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In this study, mitochondrial p53 was found preferentially in radiosensitive organs or in cultured cells that respond to p53 by undergoing apoptosis, rather than a cell-cycle arrest.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	66	 These results suggest that the ability to accumulate mitochondrial p53 may be a distinguishing feature between radiosensitive and radioresistant organs and a determinant of whether or not a cell will die in response to p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	67	 However, another model has recently been proposed which intertwines the activity of p53 at the mitochondria and the function of PUMA even more closely (35).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	68	 As mentioned earlier, p53 can interact with the pro-survival BH3 proteins like BclxL, and it is possible that this interaction serves to inhibit the  activator  function of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	69	 PUMA has a very high affinity for the pro-survival proteins and appears to function like an  enabler  BH3-only protein (36,37).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Therefore, when expressed at sufficiently high levels, PUMA may be able to dissociate p53 from the pro-survival proteins and thereby drive the activation of apoptosis (Figure 2D).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Clearly, this cannot be the only route through which PUMA functions, since PUMA induces apoptosis in p53-null cells too (15).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, it is likely that the principal role for PUMA is to release the  enabler  proteins (which would now encompass Bid, Bim and p53) from the anti-apoptotic proteins to drive the activation of Bax and Bak.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	73	 This model nicely ties together the transcriptionally independent activity of p53 with the transcriptionally dependent activation of proteins like PUMA and suggests how the final apoptotic response may require both of these events.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	74	The ability of p53 to function at the mitochondria has also led to a reassessment of the consequences of how nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of p53 might be regulated.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Rather intriguingly, this brings us back to considering one of the main negative regulators of p53 function, Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The role of Mdm2 in controlling p53 function is clear from numerous studies in cells and in mice, and stress-induced inhibition of Mdm2 function is key to the activation of p53 (38).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal region of p53 that also contains the transcriptional activation domain (Figure 1), and this interaction of Mdm2 with p53 can block the binding of other components of the transcriptional machinery and inhibit the ability of p53 to activate transcription.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Mdm2 can also directly repress transcription, in part through its ability to function as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and ubiquitinate histones (39).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	79	 This E3 activity of Mdm2 is also critically important for the ubiquitination of p53, an activity that leads to the degradation and maintenance of low levels of p53 in unstressed cells.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The importance of the negative regulation of p53 by Mdm2 has been demonstrated in many systems, and it is generally accepted that inhibition of Mdm2 will result in the activation of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	81	 It is, therefore, somewhat heretical to suggest that Mdm2 may also be enabling some p53 functions, but the observation that Mdm2 is required for p53 to export from the nucleus (40,41) suggests that Mdm2 activity might contribute to the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic activities of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The mechanism through which Mdm2 drives nuclear export of p53 is not completely clear, although it is associated with ubiquitination of p53 (42,43) and many involve the unmasking of the nuclear export sequences that are present in the C-terminal region of p53 (Figure 1).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2, therefore, appears to have two roles, targeting of p53 to the proteasome for degradation and nuclear export.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Differentiation between these two responses depends on the extent of ubiquitination whereas mono-ubiquitination of p53 is sufficient for nuclear export, polyubiquitination is necessary for degradation (43).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Interestingly, in support of this model the p53 found at the mitochondria has been shown to be ubiquitin modified (44).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	86	The idea that Mdm2 may actually contribute to an apoptotic activity of p53 provides some rationale for the observed differences in apoptotic activity of the two most common polymorphic forms of p53, carrying either arginine or proline at amino acid residue 72.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The Arg72 variant shows an enhanced ability to interact with Mdm2 and Crm1 and is more efficiently exported from the nucleus and localized to the mitochondria than the Pro72 form (44).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Consistent with the importance for this localization of p53, the Arg72 variant shows significantly higher apoptotic activity.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Interestingly, the apoptotic defect of p53 proteins mutated in the N-terminus that had been ascribed to loss of transcriptional function (45 to 47) may also reflect a failure to bind Mdm2 and so relocalize to the mitochondria.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	90	Taken together, it seems that p53-induced apoptosis represents the culmination of many activities, including the activation of expression of a number of target genes, repression of gene expression and an ability to activate Bax or Bak in a transcriptionally independent manner.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Dissecting the relative importance of each of these functions to the overall apoptotic activity of p53 will be complex, and the identification of a mutant that could separate these functions would certainly be extremely helpful.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	92	The clarity of our vision of how p53 functions is becoming even more clouded with a growing appreciation of the importance of p53-induced responses other than apoptosis in preventing tumor development.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Certainly, the ability to induce cell death has been strongly linked to the function of p53 as a tumor suppressor (48,49).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Compelling studies showing that transformed cells are more sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis, and that under conditions of Myc or E1A driven tumorigenesis in mice, blocking apoptosis by overexpression of Bcl2 (50) or loss of Apaf1 (51) could substitute for loss of p53, strongly suggest that the ability to induce cell death might be key to the success of p53 as a tumor suppressor.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In vivo model systems examining Myc-induced lymphomas also provide elegant support for a tumor suppressive role of PUMA in these studies loss of PUMA was as effective at accelerating tumor development as loss of p53 (19).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	96	 However, there is now accumulating evidence that simply preventing the apoptotic response to p53 is not the same as losing p53 function completely.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	97	 For example, the PUMA knock-out mice do not resemble p53-null animals with respect to tumor development, despite showing profound defects in their apoptotic response in many tissues (17,18).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	98	 These observations therefore suggest that other activities of p53, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest or senescence and the contribution to the maintenance of genomic stability, also play an important role in tumor suppression.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	99	 As with apoptosis, pinning down the contribution of the cell-cycle arrest response to p53 tumor suppression has been complicated.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Although the deletion of p21WAF1/CIP1, one of the key mediators of the proliferative block induced by p53, can enhance susceptibility to cancer development in some models (52), loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 is not equivalent to loss of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Indeed in some systems, loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 may even impede tumorigenesis, possibly as a reflection of tissue and system-dependent pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of p21WAF1/CIP1 (53).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	102	 However, notwithstanding this complexity in the contribution of p21WAF1/CIP1, it seems clear that the proliferative block induced by p53 in the shape of cell-cycle arrest or senescence may be as important in preventing cancer development as the induction of cell death.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Some of this evidence has come from a reexamination of specific tumor derived p53 mutants that dissociate p53's apoptotic and cell-cycle responses.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Initial tissue culture studies indicated that while these mutants remain competent in the induction of cell-cycle arrest, they fail to induce apoptosis (54).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Interestingly, these p53 mutants function to enhance the transformation of cells in culture (55), adding further weight to the suggestion that apoptosis is the key tumor suppressor function of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	106	 More recently, however, a knock-in mouse expressing one such mutant p53 was created and interestingly, despite showing a complete loss of p53-mediated apoptosis and a reduced p53-induced cell-cycle arrest, these mice retained some ability to resist tumor development (56).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Although clearly more susceptible to cancer than their wild-type littermates (suggesting apoptosis does indeed play some role), the incidence of tumor development was far less than that seen in p53-null mice, strongly indicating that the ability to induce a proliferative block, which was matched by a maintenance of genomic stability, is an important weapon in the tumor suppressive armoury of p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	108	 These model systems will encourage us to think again about which p53 activities we should be trying to restore for therapy should we concentrate on apoptosis, cell cycle progression or even senescence (57)? Even if the ability of p53 to induce a proliferative block can inhibit tumor development, will it also be true that reinstating such a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest can help to cure a cancer? More importantly, will attempts to modulate the proliferative block in tumor cells have effects on the apoptotic response? For example, the identification of p21WAF1/CIP1 as a survival factor that might ideally be inhibited as a part of tumor therapy (58) suggests that reactivating this p53 response may have unanticipated and undesirable consequences for tumor cell survival.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	109	Clearly, there are many questions that remain to be answered, but despite the obvious gaps in our understanding of exactly how p53 works, the role of p53 in tumor suppression is indisputable.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This has encouraged the development of numerous approaches to harnessing the power of p53 for tumor therapy, including gene therapy to directly express wild-type p53 (59) as well as the development of small molecules that can restore function to mutant p53 (60) or reactivate wild-type p53 (61).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The latter approach depends on the observation that many tumors that retain a wild-type p53 gene show defects in the pathways that allow the activation of p53 in response to stress, in most cases resulting in an inability to turn off Mdm2.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In these tumors, targeting Mdm2 would be expected to stabilize and activate p53.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	113	 One extremely promising approach has been to identify small molecule inhibitors of the Mdm2 to p53 interaction (62).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Although inhibition of protein to protein interactions is not usually a favourite target for drug development, in this case, the success of the Nutlin compounds may reflect the extremely tightly defined interaction of a small domain of p53 into a deep pocket in Mdm2 (63).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Other approaches include the use of antisense oligonucleotides to inihibit Mdm2 expression (64) and the identification of small molecules that inhibit the E3 activity of Mdm2 (65).
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Interestingly, although the inhibition of Mdm2 activity should also hinder the mitochondrial function of p53 by preventing nuclear export, the results indicate that p53 activity can be restored with sufficient efficiency to induce an apoptotic response.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	117	Although promising, these approaches have by no means exhausted the potential of p53 as a therapeutic target.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	118	 As we discover more about p53, the list of possible drug targets that might allow for the reactivation of at least some facet of p53 tumor suppression also increases.
0.5127752.15888490.html.plaintext.txt	119	 We look forward to a continuing boom in our understanding of the basic biology of p53 advancing, hand-in-hand, with an increased ability to exploit this knowledge for cancer therapy.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The plasminogen/plasmin system includes the uPA, its receptor, and its inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interactions between these molecules regulate cellular proteolysis as well as adhesion, cellular proliferation, and migration, processes germane to the pathogenesis of lung injury and neoplasia.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In previous studies, we found that uPA regulates cell surface fibrinolysis by regulating its own expression as well as that of the uPA receptor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this study, we found that uPA alters expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in Beas2B airway epithelial cells in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These effects do not require uPA catalytic activity because the amino-terminal fragment of uPA lacking catalytic activity was as potent as two chain active uPA.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Single chain uPA also enhanced p53 expression to the same extent as intact two chain active uPA and the amino-terminal fragment.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Pretreatment of cells with anti-1 integrin antibody blocked uPA-induced p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 uPA-induced p53 expression occurs without increased p53 mRNA expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, uPA induced oncoprotein MDM2 in a concentration-dependent manner.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	13	 uPA-induced p53 expression does not require activation of tyrosine kinases.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 inhibits both basal and uPA-induced p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Plasmin did not alter uPA-mediated p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The induction of p53 expression by exposure of lung epithelial cells to uPA is a newly recognized pathway by which urokinase may influence the proliferation of lung epithelial cells.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This pathway could regulate pathophysiologic alterations of p53 expression in the setting of lung inflammation or neoplasia.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	18	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)1 is a serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (1-3).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The proteolytic enzyme uPA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung inflammation and the growth of lung tumors.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	20	 uPA facilitates remodeling of the transitional stroma via the breakdown of basement membranes and extracellular matrix proteins, including fibrin (1-3), and is implicated in stromal remodeling that may occur in either lung inflammation or neoplasia.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	21	Pathologic overexpression of uPA has been linked to a wide range of inflammatory and neoplastic lung diseases (4, 5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For example, high levels of uPA as well as PAI-1 and uPAR in lung tumor tissue correlate with poor prognosis (6, 7).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, increasingly compelling evidence for the involvement of the uPA system in cell proliferation, migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis (8-17) has positioned plasminogen activation as central to the propagation of neoplasms (5).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In certain tumors, neoplastic growth can be effectively attenuated by PAI-1, presumably through its interaction with uPA (18).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	25	In addition to its proteolytic properties, recent data from our laboratory has demonstrated that uPA enhanced expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in Beas2B cells (19-21).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Elaboration of these molecules influences two major features associated with lung neoplasia, including excessive proliferation of neoplastic cells and their capacity to invade normal tissues.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It is now clear that the pathogenesis of lung neoplasia prominently involves expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 (22-24) as well as extracellular matrix degradation by uPA-mediated plasminogen activation (6, 7, 24).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Among the plethora of potentially useful markers of tumor virulence that have been identified to date, both uPA and p53 appear to be promising (24, 25).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The prognostic value of uPA and p53 accumulation has been reported in primary breast cancer patients (8-16), supporting their role in tumor progression and overall survival.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, no direct relationship between tumor suppression and extracellular matrix degradation has been established to date.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	31	Stimulation of the lung epithelium by uPA elicits proliferative responses via signaling mechanisms that are incompletely characterized at present.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Expression of growth factor activity has been attributed to uPA stimulation and suggests activation of such signaling processes (8-16).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	33	 uPA bound to its receptor activates intracellular signaling through protein intermediates that are currently not well understood.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	166	 5a, herbimycin A and genistein alone did not induce p53 expression nor did either inhibitor reverse uPA-mediated p53 expression by Beas2B cells.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The interaction between uPA and uPAR at the cancer cell surface also appears to be a critical event in the pathogenesis of neoplastic growth and metastasis, mediating tissue remodeling and desmoplasia, tumor cell invasion, adhesion, and proliferation of neoplastic cells (1, 5, 10).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Binding of uPA to uPAR mediates cell proliferation in several cell types, including nonmalignant lung epithelial cells, lung carcinoma-derived cells, and malignant mesothelioma (12, 39).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Tumor cell invasion is often facilitated by a dramatic increase in the production of the plasminogen activators, particularly uPA (39-43).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The tumor suppressor p53 gene is mutated or suppressed in the majority of human tumors (22), and introduction of the wild-type p53 gene into p53-deficient tumor cells suppresses transformation and tumorigenesis and inhibits proliferation of many malignant cell types (24).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Pathways that regulate the uPA-uPAR system and p53 expression are therefore germane to the pathogenesis of lung injury and neoplasia.

0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	291	 At low concentrations of uPA, Beas2B cells undergo apoptosis as a consequence of increased p53 accumulation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This is accomplished by two independent mechanisms.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	293	 First, uPA induces Ser-15 phosphorylation at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, which impairs p53 interaction with MDM2 and its degradation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Second, at a low concentration uPA also fails to maintain elevated levels of MDM2 protein required for p53 turnover.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	295	 However, at higher uPA concentrations induction of MDM2 protein as well as inhibition of Ser-15 phosphorylation leads to increased degradation of p53, which results in reduced apoptosis and increased DNA synthesis.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	296	In previous studies, we and others have found that uPA influences uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 expression through posttranscriptional pathways (19-21).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Similar influences on uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 mRNA stabilities are also discovered in lung cancer-derived cell lines (25, 56).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	298	 It has been reported previously that p53 regulates fibrinolysis by inhibiting uPA expression through suppression of promoter and enhancer activity of the uPA gene and the activation of the PAI-1 promoter (58, 59).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The present study suggests that uPA may overcome the transcriptional control of p53 over the expression of uPA and PAI-1 by inhibiting the p53 expression itself at higher a concentration.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Activation of c-Myc stabilizes p53 protein in quiescent mouse fibroblasts (57), indicating the involvement of p53-induced apoptosis and cell cycle reentry to prevent cell proliferation induced by oncogene activation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Because uPA is known to induce cell proliferation on a wide variety of cell types, including fibroblasts (8-15), uPA-mediated p53 induction probably mediates apoptosis as a safeguard to prevent unrestrained cell proliferation induced by uPA.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	302	 It is highly likely that uPA at a higher concentration probably induces cell proliferation by disrupting this safeguard mechanism through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	303	The identification of a newly defined mechanism by which the uPA regulates expression of p53 suggests the possibility that other novel pathways could likewise influence cellular transformation.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Based upon our previous observations, the induction of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 by uPA in lung epithelial cells could likewise contribute to altered p53 expression, possibly by influencing the kinetics of internalization of trimeric complexes of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The precise regulatory levels by which uPA induces p53 expression by lung epithelial cells remain to be elucidated in studies that extend this report.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	306	We found that the induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells requires receptor interaction and that the LMW fragment could not reproduce the effect.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Engagement of 1 integrin with specific antibody inhibited uPA-induced p53 expression, indicating the intricate connections between expression of p53 and uPA-uPAR integrin-mediated adhesion.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	308	 There are precedents for this mode of uPA-mediated induction of cellular responses.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	309	 uPA is mitogenic for several different cell types.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The mitogenic response likewise requires receptor interaction with uPA in pleural mesothelioma as well as epidermal tumor cell lines (8-15).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The inhibitory effect of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor on p53 expression indicates that the process involves cellular signaling mainly through activation of tyrosine phosphatases.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Alternatively, uPA stimulation of Beas2B cells may also induce synthesis of growth factors or cytokines that in turn may induce p53 protein.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	313	 The elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the prolonged effect of uPA on the p53 protein level remains to be determined.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Phosphorylation of serines 15 and 20 following genotoxic stress (25, 43-56) has been demonstrated to impair interaction between p53 and MDM2, resulting in enhanced p53 accumulation (45).
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In contrast to DNA damage, differential expression of p53 predicated on uPA concentration can act as a selective pressure during tumor growth for the elimination of cells with wild-type p53 and clonal expansion of cells with diminished p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Induction of p53 by uPA in Beas2B cells clearly is not mediated via generation of plasmin because exposure of cells to treatment with plasmin did not affect p53 expression.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	317	In summary, we now report that uPA stimulates expression of p53 by lung epithelial cells in culture.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	318	 If operative in vivo, this pathway could contribute to the relative local overexpression of uPA and the neoplastic transformation associated with lung cancer.
0.4897949.15937335.html.plaintext.txt	319	 To our knowledge, this newly identified pathway is the first description of the ability of uPA to regulate the expression of p53 in any cell type.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	5	The p53 tumor suppressor is stabilized and activated by diverse stress signals.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this study, we investigated the mechanism of p53 activation by heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and caused accumulation of p53 at the post-transcriptional level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Heat shock induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in an ATM kinase-dependent fashion, which may contribute partially to heat-induced p53 accumulation.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, p53 accumulation also occurred after heat shock in ATM-deficient cells.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Heat shock induced conformational change of wild type p53 and binding to hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Inhibition of hsp90-p53 interaction by geldanamycin prevented p53 accumulation partially in ATM-wild type cells and completely in ATM-deficient cells.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Therefore, phosphorylation and interaction with hsp90 both contribute to stabilization of p53 after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	14	The p53 tumor suppressor is an important regulator of cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In normal cells, p53 is maintained at a very low level because of rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (1).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In response to different stress stimuli including ionizing radiation, UV, and hypoxia, p53 is activated and stabilized as a transcription factor.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Activated p53 induces the expression of p21WAF1, gadd45, bax, p53AIP, PUMA, and others, which in turn induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	18	The level of p53 in cells is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by the MDM21 oncoprotein.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	19	 MDM2 binds to p53 and promotes its ubiquitination by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (3-5).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Expression of MDM2 is activated by p53 at the transcription level (6, 7), forming a negative feedback loop to maintain p53 at low levels.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To date, most stress signals that activate p53 are known to interfere with the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 degradation by phosphorylation of p53, induction of the MDM2 inhibitor ARF, or inhibition of MDM2 expression (1, 2).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM may also play a role in p53 activation after DNA damage (8).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The MDM2-binding domain in the N terminus of p53 contains several phosphorylation sites (9, 10).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Recent studies (11, 12) suggest that after DNA damage, the phosphorylation of Ser-15 by the ATM kinase and Ser-20 by human Chk2 plays important roles in p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 binding.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	25	Previous reports (13-17) show that heat shock (1 h at 43  degrees C) also induces p53 accumulation in wild type p53 cell lines and contributes to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Heat shock is clinically useful in facilitating the treatment of certain tumors such as gliomas in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (18-20).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Therefore, investigating the mechanism of p53 accumulation after heat shock is important in understanding p53 response to a physiologically relevant stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A previous study (22) suggests that p53 accumulation in response to heat is not the result of a general stress-induced increase in protein synthesis, because heat causes a reduction in overall cellular protein synthesis.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Heat shock has been reported to induce DNA damage (21), suggesting that it may stabilize and activate p53 in part through the DNA damage response pathways.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	30	 A recent study shows (15) an increase in p53 mRNA level after heat treatment of A-172 glioma cells, suggesting a mechanism of induction at the transcriptional level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	31	Stabilization of p53 also occurs in tumor cells with mutated p53, which result in an accumulation to high levels.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Missense mutations of p53 in the DNA-binding core domain cause conformational change and stable association with molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 (23, 24).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	33	 hsp90 binding has been shown to contribute to the accumulation of mutant p53 and many other client proteins (25-27).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Our recent studies show (28, 29) that binding of hsp90 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both mutant p53 and MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	35	 hsp90 appears to inactivate MDM2 by blocking the central domain of MDM2 normally involved in regulation by ARF, thereby mimicking the effect of ARF to prevent mutant p53 degradation (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	36	Although the role of hsp90 in mutant p53 stabilization is well established, there is no evidence to date that it contributes to the stabilization of wild type p53 during stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Molecular chaperones only associate with certain proteins in a transient manner during folding or during heat shock response.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Wild type p53 does not form stable complex with hsp90 in normal growth conditions.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Because DNA damage does not induce p53 conformational change, hsp90 is unlikely to play a role in DNA damage response.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, p53 is a structurally unstable protein and undergoes conformational change (denaturation) at temperatures above 40  degrees C in vitro (30).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	41	 (31) also indicates that heat shock alters the conformation of wild type p53, allowing the formation of the p53 hsc70 complex.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Therefore, it is possible that hsp90 binding also interacts with wild type p53 after heat shock and plays a role in stabilizing p53 through mechanisms similar to the stabilization of mutant p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	43	In this study, we investigated the role of p53 conformational change and interaction with hsp90 in the stabilization of p53 after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Furthermore, we examined the phosphorylation status of p53 after heat shock treatment.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Our results showed that heat shock induced p53 accumulation by promoting ATM-dependent serine 15 phosphorylation and complex formation with hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Both mechanisms contribute to p53 stabilization after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Our results identified the first example of hsp90 participation in regulating wild type p53 stress response.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The protein levels of p53 and MDM2 were measured by Western blot.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Quantitation of the level of p53 by loading titration indicated that heat shock caused a 6 to 8-fold increase in p53 level 4 h after termination of heat treatment (data not shown).

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The magnitude of p53 accumulation after MG132 treatment provided an indication of how rapidly p53 was degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The result showed that in control cells, a 4-h treatment with MG132 caused a significant increase in p53 level.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	116	Because p53 turnover is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, we examined the level of p53 ubiquitination by direct lysis in SDS sample buffer, which preserved polyubiquitinated forms of p53.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	118	 There was significant recovery of p53 ubiquitination at 4 h after heat shock, which may be because of high level MDM2 expression at this time point and the start of a recovery process (Fig.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	149	p53 Conformational Change after Heat Shock-- To test the hypothesis that heat shock caused wild type p53 conformational change, p53 was precipitated by mutant-specific Pab240 and wild type-specific Pab1620 antibodies (35).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Pab240 recognizes hydrophobic peptide sequences of p53 normally packed inside the DNA-binding core domain (36); therefore, the exposure of the Pab240 epitope is indicative of misfolded p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The result showed that in control A-172 cells, p53 could be precipitated efficiently by Pab1620 but weakly by Pab240 (Fig.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	154	 At 4 h after heat shock, which was the highest point of p53 accumulation, p53 reactivity to Pab1620 increased strongly and Pab240 reactivity reduced significantly.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Therefore, there was rapid recovery of p53 conformation back to the wild type status after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The result also showed that change of p53 conformation correlated with the level of p53 ubiquitination (Fig.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Therefore, change in p53 conformation may also play a role in stabilizing p53.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	161	 A, A-172 cells were treated with heat shock, and p53 was immunoprecipitated by wild type-specific Pab1620 and mutant-specific Pab240 using identical amounts of cell lysate followed by Western blot with DO-1.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	162	 B, A-172 cells were immunoprecipitated with Pab1801 after heat shock using identical amounts of cell lysate followed by anti-hsp90 Western blot.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Control A-172 and DLD-1 (mutant p53) cells were maintained at 37  degrees C.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	164	Wild Type p53 Binds to hsp90 after Heat Shock-- hsp90 binding is important for preventing degradation of many cellular proteins including mutant p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Disruption of hsp90 mutant p53 binding leads to destabilization of p53 through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes (25, 27, 29, 37).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Because heat shock induced significant conformational change in wild type p53, we asked whether hsp90 also regulates wild type p53 stability by binding to p53 and preventing its degradation by MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	167	To test the binding between hsp90 and p53, conformation-independent Pab1801 antibody was used to precipitate p53 from cell lysate harvested 2 and 4 h after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Coprecipitated hsp90 was detected by Western blot of the p53 precipitate using hsp90-specific antibody.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The results showed that hsp90 did not coprecipitate with wild type p53 in the control A-172 cultures without heat shock treatment (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, significant amounts of hsp90 coprecipitated with the mutant p53 protein in DLD-1 cells at 37  degrees C and also with wild type p53 in the heat-treated A-172 cells (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The binding between p53 and hsp90 was stronger at 2 h after heat shock than 4 h, because more p53 was present in the 4-h lysate yet the amount of hsp90 coprecipitated did not increase (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This was consistent with the significant recovery of wild type p53 conformation and ubiquitination level observed at this time point.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, heat shock induced transient association between wild type p53 and hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	174	Inhibition of hsp90 Prevents p53 Accumulation after Heat Shock-- Binding between hsp90 and mutant p53 is known to cause p53 stabilization (25, 27, 29, 37).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Therefore, we examined the role of hsp90 on wild type p53 stability after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	176	 A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The level of p53 was measured by Western blot 4 h after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The results showed that without heat shock, geldanamycin treatment did not significantly affect p53 level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, geldanamycin prevented the accumulation of p53 after heat shock in ATM-deficient AT-29 cells (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	180	 6A), suggesting that hsp90 function was important for p53 accumulation.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The inhibitory effect of geldanamycin was not as complete in A-172 and NC-607 cells, probably because ATM-mediated phosphorylation also contributed to p53 stabilization.

0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	184	 A, cells were treated with heat shock in the presence or absence of 4  microM geldanamycin (GA), and p53 levels were determined by Western blot after 4 h.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	185	 B, the effect of geldanamycin on p53 hsp90 binding after heat shock was determined by treating cells in the presence of 4  microM geldanamycin and immunoprecipitation of p53 with Pab1801 4 h after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Coprecipitation of hsp90 was detected by Western blot.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The amounts of cell lysate used for precipitation were adjusted to contain a similar amount of p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	188	Geldanamycin binds to the ATP-binding site of hsp90 and often reduces its binding to client proteins (26).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	189	 To confirm that geldanamycin blocked hsp90-p53 binding after heat shock, A-172, NC-607, and AT-29 cells were treated with heat shock and geldanamycin.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	190	 hsp90-p53 binding was detected by p53 immunoprecipitation followed by hsp90 Western blot.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The result showed that geldanamycin treatment reduced hsp90-p53 coprecipitation in the three cell lines (Fig.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Therefore, inhibition of hsp90-p53 binding after heat shock prevented p53 accumulation.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	193	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	194	The results described above show that short term exposure to elevated temperature causes accumulation and activation of wild type p53.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Increased p53 expression level is not because of induction of p53 transcription, because its mRNA level does not change after heat stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Similar to other forms of p53 stress response, reduced ubiquitination and degradation appears to be the major cause of its accumulation after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The stabilized p53 is functional in inducing expression of downstream target genes and has been shown to contribute to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis response after heat shock (13, 15).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Therefore, p53 activation after heat shock is a functionally relevant response to environmental stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	199	Ubiquitination and degradation of p53 is mainly regulated by MDM2.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Many p53 responses to environmental or cellular stresses cause p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 function.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2, inhibition of MDM2 expression, and inactivation of MDM2 by expression of ARF have all been implicated in wild type p53 accumulation (1, 38).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Furthermore, stabilization of mutant p53 involves binding to molecular chaperones hsp90 (25, 27, 37).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	203	 hsp90-mutant p53 complex is resistant to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, because MDM2 bound to p53 in such a complex is inactivated by hsp90 (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	204	 hsp90 appears to conceal the ARF binding site on MDM2 in hsp90 p53 MDM2 complexes and prevent MDM2 from ubiquitinating p53 and itself.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	205	 As a result, both MDM2 and mutant p53 become stabilized in tumor cells expressing mutant p53 (28).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	206	 We previously showed that dissociation of hsp90 by geldanamycin treatment restores the ubiquitination and degradation of mutant p53 (29).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Therefore, hsp90-mutant p53 complex also causes p53 stabilization by interfering with MDM2 activity.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	208	Molecular chaperones such as hsp70 and hsp90 recognize exposed hydrophobic regions in misfolded proteins, nascent polypeptides, and ligand binding sites of steroid hormone receptors (26, 39).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Wild type p53 is a structurally unstable protein and readily undergoes conformational change above 40  degrees C in vitro (30).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Point mutations in the DNA-binding domain disrupt proper folding and cause structural change at physiological temperatures.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Different mutations lead to different temperature sensitivities; some mutations (such as the Val-138) remain functional and conformationally wild type at 32  degrees C and lose activity at 39  degrees C (40).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Many hot spot mutations found in human tumors cause significant conformational changes and complete loss of activity at physiological temperature (41).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Therefore, it is conceivable that heat shock also causes transient conformational change of wild type p53 similar to the misfolding caused by structural mutations, resulting in binding by hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	214	We suggest that heat shock causes a transient misfolding of wild type p53, which attracts binding by hsp90.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	215	 hsp90 binding would prevent p53 aggregation and facilitate the refolding process.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, hsp90 binding would also prevent MDM2-mediated degradation in a manner similar to stabilization of mutant p53 by hsp90 at 37  degrees C.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Unlike mutant p53, which cannot fold properly even in the presence of molecular chaperones, heat-denatured wild type p53 can be efficiently refolded by chaperones at 37  degrees C.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Therefore, the conformational change after heat shock is transient, and p53 level begins to decrease several hours after heat shock.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This correlates with return of normal p53 ubiquitination level.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	220	However, hsp90 appears not to be the only regulator of p53 stabilization after heat shock, because the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin did not cause a complete block in p53 accumulation in ATM wild type cell lines.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	221	 We found that heat shock also induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20, which are sites important for regulating the stability and transcription activity of p53 (1).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 is dependent on ATM kinase activity and ATM-mediated activation of human Chk2 kinase, suggesting that heat shock can activate the ATM kinase and induce p53 accumulation in part through phosphorylation.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	223	 A previous study (21) shows that heat shock causes low levels of DNA damage.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Our results also showed that heat shock only induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 and Ser-20, whereas the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced stronger phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 as well as an additional phosphorylation at Ser-46.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This is consistent with the requirement of severe DNA damage for inducing Ser-46 phosphorylation (42).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Therefore, heat shock may activate ATM through inducing low level of DNA damage, which in turn activates p53 by phosphorylation of p53 or MDM2 (8).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	227	 DNA damage-mediated dephosphorylation of MDM2-acidic domain may also play a role in stabilization of p53 (43).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	228	 During the course or our study, Miyakoda et al.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	229	 (17) also reported that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 occurs after heat shock in an ATM-dependent fashion, which is consistent with our finding.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	230	In summary, ATM-mediated phosphorylation and conformation-mediated hsp90 binding cooperate to cause p53 accumulation in response to heat stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our results identify the first example in which hsp90 plays a role in regulating wild type p53 stability in response to stress.
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Conformational change of p53 has been suggested to occur in the absence of heat stress based on change of reactivity to conformation-specific antibodies (44).
0.6023452.12427754.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Therefore, it will be interesting to further investigate whether hsp90 plays a role in regulating p53 stability in other physiological processes.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have recently shown that Chk2 and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) are both involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not G1 arrest in mouse embryo fibroblasts.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here we demonstrate that Chk2 is required to activate p53 in vitro as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence following DNA damage and is in fact the previously unidentified factor working synergistically with DNA-PK to activate p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia is not involved in this p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Using wortmannin, serine 15 mutants of p53, DNA-PK null cells and Chk2 null cells, we demonstrate that DNA-PK and Chk2 act independently and sequentially on p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, the p53 target of these two kinases represents a latent (preexisting) population of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Taken together, the results from these studies are consistent with a model in which DNA damage causes an immediate and sequential modification of latent p53 by DNA-PK and Chk2, which under appropriate conditions can lead to apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In response to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR),1 eukaryotic cells can activate cell cycle checkpoints or apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The p53 tumor suppressor mediates these cell responses (1 to 4); however, an understanding of the mechanism of its activation remains elusive.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Upstream candidates include the gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) (5, 6), the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit (7 to 9), and more recently, the evolutionarily conserved checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (10 to 15).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	14	Chk2 has been demonstrated to form stable complexes with p53 (16) and was proposed to activate p53 via its kinase activity toward Ser-20 on p53 (10, 11).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Furthermore, Chk2 has been identified in a subset of Li Fraumeni patients with normal p53 alleles, making it a potential tumor suppressor protein (17 to 19).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	16	 How endogenous Chk2 functions in this capacity has been the focus of many recent studies.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Chk2-/- murine embryonic stem cells have been examined and reported to be unable to maintain IR-induced G2 arrest, and murine Chk2-/- thymocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) have been shown to have an attenuated apoptotic response (12).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The role of Chk2 in the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in the murine model has been controversial with some groups reporting its requirement, whereas others are reporting it as unnecessary for the p53-mediated G1/S arrest (12 to 15).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	19	The role of Chk2 in the human p53 responses has recently been questioned.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	20	 (20) have purified Chk2 from DNA damaged human cells and demonstrate that p53 phosphorylation is not enhanced after IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Furthermore, following introduction of Chk2 short interfering RNA into three different human tumor cell lines, p53 was still found to be stabilized and active after IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Concurrently, Jallepalli et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	23	 (21) disrupted the Chk2 gene in human cancer cells and found that p53 Ser-20 phosphorylation, stabilization, and transcriptional activation as well as its cell cycle-mediated arrest and apoptotic responses remained intact.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These two reports call into question the role of Chk2 in human cells and further question whether Chk2 lies upstream of the p53-dependent apoptotic response because it seems clear that it does lie upstream in the murine system.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	25	 More recently, however, Craig et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (22) have demonstrated that Chk2 is regulated by allosteric effects of p53 and that its kinase-dependent phosphorylation of p53 requires conformational docking sites on p53, lending evidence again to a role for human p53 as a target of Chk2 phosphorylation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	27	Because disruption of the p53 tumor suppressor is often found in many human cancers, understanding the mechanism of p53 activation is essential to our progress in the treatment of cancer.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We have recently reported that DNA-PK and Chk2 are both required for p53-mediated apoptosis in MEFs and that they function in a pathway that uses latent p53 to mediate this response (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In this study, we used various approaches to establish the link between these two kinases in p53 activation following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We show that Chk2 and DNA-PK act synergistically and in parallel to activate p53 (including human p53) as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The p53 target of these two kinases is a latent (preexisting) population of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The gene mutated in ATM is not involved in this p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our results are consistent with a model in which the immediate actions of DNA-PK and Chk2 on latent p53 following DNA damage are the first events that dictate the subsequent cellular apoptotic response.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	34	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cell Culture and Preparation of Nuclear Extracts The two glioma cell lines M059K and M059J were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In vitro translation reactions were carried out in a final volume of 50  microl containing the following components: 30  microl of cytoplasmic extract, 1 mM ATP, 0.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Translation reactions were incubated at 37  degrees C for 30 min followed by the addition of an equal volume of nuclear extract from mock-treated or -irradiated M059K or M059J cells (see above) that had been immunodepleted of endogenous p53 using the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody pAb421 preadsorbed onto inactivated Staphylococcus A (IgSorb, The Enzyme Center).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Reaction mixtures were then subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	49	DNA Binding Analysis by EMSA DNA binding was analyzed by EMSA using the 32P-labeled p53 consensus sequence 5'-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCAAGCT-3' as described previously (7).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	50	Western Blotting For SDS-PAGE, protein samples were boiled for 5 to 10 min in protein sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature with an applied current of 35 mA for 3 h.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 80 V, 4  degrees C.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The blot next was incubated in primary antibody (FL393 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 Ser-15-phosphospecific antibody, and Chk2 Thr-68-phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)) at a dilution of 1: 1000 in blocking buffer for 1 h.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Following incubation with the primary antibody, the blot was thoroughly washed in blocking buffer.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories) IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 to 45 min followed by washing in blocking buffer.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The blot was then subjected to chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For protein loading control, a monoclonal antibody to actin or tubulin (Sigma) was used at 1:10,000 dilution and processing was carried out as described.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	61	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   DNA-PK and Chk2 Are Both Required to Activate p53 DNA Binding in Vitro We have previously demonstrated that DNA-PK is necessary but not sufficient to activate p53 DNA binding in vitro and that an unknown factor present in DNA damaged cells is also required for p53 activation (7).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	62	 More recently, we reported that both DNA-PK and Chk2 are involved in p53-dependent apoptosis and that the latent, rather than the inducible population of p53, is implicated in this process (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	63	 To determine whether the unknown factor that collaborated with DNA-PK in activating p53 in vitro was Chk2, we employed the same cell-free translation system used previously to show that DNA-PK acts upstream of p53 in promoting p53 sequence-specific binding (7).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Accordingly, wild-type human p53 was translated in a cytoplasmic extract prepared from the human glioma cell line M059J, which lacks any DNA-PK activity (because of defective expression of DNA-PK catalytic subunit) (23).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Nuclear extract from either DNA-PK-positive (M059K) or null (M059J) glioma cell lines (untreated or -irradiated) was then added to test whether the translated p53 could be activated for p53 binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	66	 As previously reported (7), the irradiated glioma line with DNA-PK (M059K) activated p53 binding as did the glioma line lacking DNA-PK (M059J) if supplemented with purified DNA-PK (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Most importantly, whereas DNA-PK or Chk2 (in vitro translated) alone was unable to activate p53 (lanes 5 and 6), together they activated p53 binding to the same extent as with the irradiated nuclear extract (lane 7).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The specificity of the Chk2 kinase in this role was confirmed because Chk1 kinase did not cooperate with DNA-PK to activate p53 (data not shown).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The ability of DNA-PK to activate p53 in the absence of DNA damage in this case can be explained by the fact that DNA-PK is activated by the presence of DNA ends supplied by the consensus DNA sequence.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Also, it has been shown recently that overexpression of Chk2 can result in autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation events that activate Chk2 in the absence of IR (24).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Therefore, our experiment identifies the previously hypothesized "unknown" nuclear factor acting with DNA-PK to activate p53 DNA binding in vitro (13) as the checkpoint kinase Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In addition, because all of the components involved are human in origin, our experiment supports a possible role of Chk2 upstream of human p53.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Wild-type p53 was translated in cytoplasmic extracts from M059J cells.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The following was then added to the reaction: lane 1, control (nothing added); lane 2, nuclear extract from -irradiated M059J (J*) cells; lane 3, same as lane 2 with the exception that purified DNA-PK holoenzyme was also added; lane 4, nuclear extract from -irradiated M059K (K*) cells; lane 5, purified DNA-PK holoenzyme; lane 6, Chk2 (in vitro translated); and lane 7, purified DNA-PK holoenzyme and Chk2 in combination.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Samples from these reactions were then tested for p53 sequence-specific DNA binding activity by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	78	  ATM Is Not Required for Activation of p53 Sequence-specific Binding in Vitro We previously reported that whereas both DNA-PK and Chk2 are required for activating latent p53-mediated apoptosis in MEFs, ATM is dispensable for this activity (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	79	 We now seek to determine whether the in vitro system required ATM to activate p53 DNA binding and establish whether this system reflects the observed apoptotic situation in MEFs.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	80	To this end, nuclear cell extracts were prepared from an ataxia telangiectasia (A-T)-lymphoblastoid cell line and examined for their ability to activate p53 DNA binding in the cell-free translation system.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The p53 in these A-T cells is highly unstable, and therefore, no endogenous p53 protein was detectable by EMSA (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	82	 2, lanes 6 and 7) or by Western blot (data not shown).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	83	 However, nuclear extracts from IR-treated A-T cells, similar to those from IR-treated M059K cells, were able to activate in vitro translated p53 (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This finding suggests that ATM, although necessary for the stabilization of p53, is not required for the activation of p53 DNA binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In an independent experiment, A-T cells were treated with leptomycin B to determine whether accumulation of p53 by stabilization alone was enough to activate p53 DNA binding and it was found that it was not (data not shown).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	86	 This finding is consistent with our previous results, demonstrating that Chk2 functions independently of ATM to activate the p53-apoptotic response (13).

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	88	 ATM is dispensable for in vitro activation of p53 DNA binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Wild-type 53 was synthesized in a cell-free translation system, and nuclear extracts from non-DNA-damaged or -irradiated (IR) M059K cells or A-T lymphoblasts were added.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The reaction mixtures were then assayed for p53 sequence-specific binding by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	91	  DNA-PK and Chk2 Act Independently and Sequentially to Activate p53 We then proceeded to determine whether DNA-PK and Chk2 act independently of one another or whether they are required for each other's action.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	92	 A number of experimental approaches were taken to examine the sequence of events in the activation of p53 by DNA-PK and Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	93	Using the in vitro system, the fungal metabolite wortmannin was employed to inhibit DNA-PK before and after the addition of various components in the pathway.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	94	 3A, DNA-PK activity is required to activate p53 because inhibition of DNA-PK prior to its incubation with p53 prevented p53 DNA binding (compare lanes 3 and 4).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	95	 By contrast, if DNA-PK and p53 are allowed to interact and then DNA-PK is inhibited by wortmannin prior to Chk2 addition, p53 binding can still be observed (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This finding suggests that DNA-PK acts directly on p53 but it is not upstream of Chk2.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Wild-type p53 was translated in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The following was then added to the reaction: lane 1, control (nothing added); lane 2, Chk2 (in vitro translated); lane 3, Chk2 and purified DNA-PK holoenzyme in combination; lane 4, DNA-PK that had been inactivated by wortmannin for 10 min followed by Chk2; lane 5, DNA-PK for 10 min, wortmannin for 10 min, and then Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	102	 p53 DNA binding was then assayed by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	103	 B, Chk2 is required, but DNA-PK is dispensable for Ser-15 p53 mutant DNA binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	104	 S15A or S15D p53 mutants were translated and assayed for their requirement of Chk2 and DNA-PK to induce DNA binding to the consensus sequence as assayed by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	105	 C, comparing the serine 15 modification (S15A) to those at other serine phosphorylation sites (S315A, S392A, S37A, S20A, and S20D) in terms of requirement for DNA-PK and Chk2 for activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	106	 S15A requires only Chk2, whereas wild-type as well as all of the other serine mutants of p53 require both DNA-PK and Chk2 for activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	107	 D, comparing DNA damage-induced phosphorylation on serine 15 of p53 in Chk2+/+ and Chk2-/- MEFs.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Cells were exposed to -irradiation and harvested at various times thereafter.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was probed with an anti-phosphoserine 15 antibody or for total p53 protein.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	110	 E, comparing DNA damage-induced phosphorylation on threonine 68 of Chk2 in M059K and M059J cells.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Cells were exposed to -irradiation and harvested at various times thereafter.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was probed with an anti-phosphothreonine 68 antibody or for total Chk2 protein.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	113	  We have previously demonstrated that Ser-15 on latent p53 is a target of DNA-PK immediately following DNA damage and that this residue plays a role in IR-induced apoptosis of MEFs (8).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	114	 To determine whether Ser-15 is also involved in the in vitro activation of p53 by DNA-PK, two Ser-15 mutants of p53, S15A and S15D, were tested in our in vitro activation assays.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Because S15D mimics phospho-Ser-15, it was expected to be active even in the absence of DNA-PK, whereas S15A would be innately inactive.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Unexpectedly, we found that for both mutants, Chk2 was absolutely required but DNA-PK was dispensable for activation of DNA binding (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	117	 This finding suggests that conformational changes in p53 brought on by Ser-15 phosphorylation, rather than a difference in charge, are responsible for DNA-PK-induced activation of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The observation that, for both S15A and S15D mutants, Chk2 alone was able to activate DNA binding in the absence of DNA-PK also strongly argues for the independence of Chk2 from DNA-PK.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It further implies that upon DNA damage, p53 is probably first acted on by DNA-PK before being further modified by Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	120	We also altered a few other serine phosphorylation sites on p53 to see whether these mutations would affect p53 activation by DNA-PK and Chk2 in any way.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	121	 These included two N-terminal phosphorylation sites, Ser-20 (a known target site of Chk2) and Ser-37 (another known DNA-PK target site), and two C-terminal phosphorylation sites, Ser-315 and Ser-392.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	122	 None of these mutations was found to alleviate the dependence on DNA-PK or Chk2 for p53 activation (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	123	 It is also interesting that the mutation of p53 at Ser-20, a known Chk2 target site, to either alanine (simulating the unphosphorylated state) or aspartic acid (simulating constitutive phosphorylation) had no effect on its requirement for Chk2, which in turn suggests that Ser-20 is not the target of Chk2 for p53 activation in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	124	That DNA-PK and Chk2 probably act on p53 independently of each other was further suggested by the following observations.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	125	 First, Chk2+/+ and Chk2-/- MEFs displayed similar levels of DNA-PK-dependent Ser-15 phosphorylation upon IR (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Second, Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr-68, often used as a measure of Chk2 activation (25 to 28), was found to be immediate and at comparable levels between human cells with and without DNA-PK (M059K and M059J, respectively) upon -irradiation (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	127	 3E), These observations, combined with those from the wortmannin and S15A and S15D studies described above (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	128	 3, A and B, respectively) have led us to conclude that DNA-PK and Chk2 work sequentially and independently of one another in activating p53 upon DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	129	Latent but Not Inducible p53 Requires Chk2 and DNA-PK for in Vitro DNA Binding We have recently reported that the latent population of p53 is sufficient to mediate the Chk2 and DNA-PK-directed p53 apoptotic response (7, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	130	 To determine whether it is the latent population of p53 whose DNA binding activity is regulated by DNA-PK and Chk2, wild-type, Chk2 null, and DNA-PK null MEFs were exposed to IR in the presence and absence of cycloheximide.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Treatment of the cells with cycloheximide blocks translation of any new p53 protein and allows us to assess the DNA binding activity of preexisting (latent) p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	132	 4 clearly shows that the latent p53 population in wild-type MEFs are activated to bind DNA upon IR.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In contrast, only the induced but not the latent population of p53 was activated in DNA-PK-/- cells.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This finding is consistent with our previous contention that DNA-PK targets latent p53, whereas ATM targets induced p53 (8, 13).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Likewise, an examination of wild-type versus Chk2-/- cells yielded the same results, suggesting that Chk2 is absolutely required for latent p53 binding to its consensus sequence (Fig.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	137	 DNA-PK and Chk2 are required for activation of latent p53 DNA binding following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Wild-type, DNA-PK-/-, or Chk2-/- MEFs were mock-treated (CTRL), -irradiated (IR), cycloheximide-treated (CHX), or CHX-treated followed by IR (CHR + IR).
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Nuclear extracts were then prepared and assayed for p53 DNA binding by EMSA.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	140	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Following DNA damage such as ionizing radiation, cell signaling events cause cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The p53 tumor suppressor is central to these responses and has been shown to be a target of a number of kinases including ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, and Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Until recently, it has been strongly suggested that following IR, the Chk2 kinase was an upstream mediator of p53 cell cycle and apoptotic responses.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	143	 With the more recent evidence questioning the role of Chk2 in human cancer cell lines, it is important to decipher the role, if any, that Chk2 plays in activating p53 responses.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	144	To examine the role of Chk2 upstream of p53, we utilized an in vitro cell free translation system whereby p53 activation could be assessed by its ability to bind its consensus sequence This system was previously used to demonstrate that DNA-PK acts upstream of p53 in response to DNA damage and that an unknown factor (also activated by DNA damage) was also involved in this process.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	145	 We now show that this unknown factor is Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These two kinases work synergistically to activate p53 DNA binding that is demonstrable in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Whether the p53 binding is an actual indication of p53 transcriptional activity or simply a readout for some conformation change in the p53 protein induced by Chk2 and DNA-PK is unclear at present.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	148	 What is clear, however, is that Chk2 and DNA-PK together are capable of activating p53 including human p53 in vitro.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	149	The observation that human ATM cell extract was also capable of promoting p53 DNA binding is also consistent with our previous demonstration that Chk2 activates p53-mediated apoptosis independently of the ATM protein.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Here again the results indicate that, although ATM is necessary to stabilize the p53 protein, the ability of Chk2 and DNA-PK to activate p53 does not require ATM.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This also underscores the need to consider stabilization and activation of p53 as two separate events.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	152	The independent nature of DNA-PK and Chk2 in activating p53 in vitro and the sequential order of their involvement were determined using a number of approaches.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We used wortmannin to show that DNA-PK must act upon p53 since inhibition of its kinase activity completely abolished p53 binding.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, if DNA-PK was first allowed to interact with p53, the subsequent addition of wortmannin did not interfere with the activating effect of Chk2 that was added later.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This indicates that DNA-PK is not required upstream of Chk2 to promote p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The demonstration that Ser-15 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK equally well in Chk2+/+ and Chk2-/- cells further attests to the complete independence of action of these two kinases.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	157	Further evidence for a parallel and sequential mechanism of p53 activation by DNA-PK and Chk2 comes from the observation that the two p53 Ser-15 mutants, S15A and S15D, do not require DNA-PK and can be activated by Chk2 alone.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Although this result is expected for the S15D mutant, which mimics phospho-Ser-15, it came initially as a surprise in the case of the S15A mutant.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The most logical explanation for both of these mutants being able to bypass the DNA-PK requirement is that modification of serine 15 by any means (phosphorylation or mutation) leads to an altered conformation of p53, which is recognizable by Chk2.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Indeed, previous work by Shieh et al.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	161	 (29) shows that phosphorylation at the serine 15 site by DNA-PK alters the tertiary structure of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	162	 (22) demonstrated that two peptides derived from the DNA binding domain of p53 could bind Chk2 and allosterically stimulate the phosphorylation of full-length p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Based on our present findings, we contend that the reason why full-length p53 by itself cannot activate Chk2 is probably because these Chk2-docking sites on native p53 are cryptic and are exposed only after phosphorylation of Ser-15 by DNA-PK.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Thus, the initial modification of p53 by DNA-PK is a prerequisite for its subsequent modification by Chk2 with the two events probably occurring quickly in tandem and resulting in full p53 activation.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	165	Finally, our study suggests that it is the latent population of p53 that is activated by DNA-PK and Chk2 upon DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This finding is consistent with our previous observation that latent p53 becomes phosphorylated at serine 15 immediately upon IR treatment and that latent p53, rather than inducible p53, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in a DNA-PK-dependent and Chk2-dependent manner.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Therefore, it therefore appears that the fate of the cell (cell growth arrest or apoptosis) is determined very early on, possibly immediately following DNA damage.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Depending on the nature and extent of DNA damage, p53 that appears later on the scene (inducible p53) may then be modified by other kinases such as ATM or ATR and may have a function that is distinct from that of the latent population of p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	169	In summary, results from our investigation are consistent with a model wherein upon DNA damage, DNA-PK, and Chk2 act synergistically and sequentially (with DNA-PK followed by Chk2) on a latent population of p53 (Fig.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The modified p53 manifests DNA binding activity in vitro, which may reflect the actual event in vivo or an altered conformational state that is unrelated to its DNA binding activity.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In either case, the extent of such modifications on this latent population of p53 probably dictates the subsequent course of action and, depending on the cell context, can lead to apoptosis.

0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Model for activation pathway of latent p53 and apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Immediately following DNA damage, DNA-PK is activated by strand breaks and phosphorylates a latent (preexisting) population of p53 on Ser-15.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	175	 This induces a conformational change in the p53 protein such that it is recognized by the Chk2 kinase, which then phosphorylates (and activates) the latent p53.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The severity and nature of DNA damage incurred dictates the extent of this latent p53 activation, which in many cell types probably represents the first obligatory event that leads to apoptosis.
0.562309.14752107.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Under circumstances where cell growth arrest or DNA repair is the preferred outcome, a separate pathway (data not shown) involving inducible p53 and mediated by ATM, ATR, or other kinases comes into play.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	4	The p53 protein contains several functional domains necessary for inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The C-terminal basic domain within residues 364-393 and the proline-rich domain within residues 64-91 are required for apoptotic activity.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In addition, activation domain 2 within residues 43-63 is necessary for apoptotic activity when the N-terminal activation domain 1 within residues 1-42 is deleted (AD1) or mutated (AD1).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we have discovered that an activation domain 2 mutation at residues 53-54 (AD2) abrogates the apoptotic activity but has no significant effect on cell cycle arrest.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We have also found that p53-(AD2), which lacks activation domain 2, is inert in inducing apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	9	 p53-(AD2BD), which is defective in activation domain 2 and lacks the C-terminal basic domain, p53-(AD2BD), which lacks both activation domain 2 and the C-terminal basic domain, and p53-(PRDBD), which lacks both the proline-rich domain and the C-terminal basic domain, are also inert in inducing apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	10	 All four mutants are still capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type p53.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Interestingly, we have found that deletion of the N-terminal activation domain 1 alleviates the requirement of the C-terminal basic domain for apoptotic activity.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus, we have generated a small but potent p53-(AD1BD) molecule.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Furthermore, we have determined that at least two of the three domains (activation domain 1, activation domain 2, and the proline-rich domain), are required for inducing cell cycle arrest.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Taken together, our results suggest that activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain form an activation domain for inducing pro-apoptotic genes or inhibiting anti-apoptotic genes.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The C-terminal basic domain is required for maintaining this activation domain competent for transactivation or transrepression.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	17	Activation of p53 leads to at least two well defined cellular responses: cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1-4).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Based on these activities and other characteristics (1, 5), the p53 protein can be divided into several functional domains.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These are activation domain 1 within residues 1-42 (6-8), activation domain 2 within residues 43-63 (9-11), the proline-rich domain within residues 64-91 (12), the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain within residues 100-300 (1), the nuclear localization signal within residues 316-325 (13), the tetramerization domain within residues 334-356 (14), which also contains a nuclear export signal (15), and the C-terminal basic domain within residues 364-393 (1, 5).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	20	p53 is frequently mutated in cancers.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mutations in the p53 DNA binding domain or certain mutations in the nuclear localization signal and tetramerization domain that indirectly affect DNA binding abrogate or diminish p53 activity in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1, 5).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The proline-rich domain has been shown to be required for efficient growth suppression (12).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recent experiments indicate that the proline-rich domain is necessary for apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest (16-18).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, the proline-rich domain plays an important role in the induction of several endogenous target genes, but is not required for activation of the exogenously introduced promoters of these target genes (17).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These results suggest that the proline-rich domain may participate in the induction of cellular target gene(s) responsible for mediating apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, the role of other p53 functional domains (especially the N-terminal activation domain 1 and the C-terminal basic domain) in apoptosis is still not certain.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Earlier reports have shown that in some experimental protocols (19-21) including our own (22), p53 transactivation activity is dispensable for apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	28	 It should be noted that this conclusion is based at least in part on the observation that an activation domain 1-deficient mutant (a double point mutation at residues 22-23, AD1)1 is capable of inducing apoptosis (21, 22).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recently, we and others have shown that p53-(AD1) contains an intact activation domain 2 (9-11), and therefore, p53-(AD1) is still competent in transactivation (10).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, when both activation domain 1 and activation domain 2 are mutated (a quadruple point mutation at residues 22-23 and 53-54, AD1AD2), the resulting protein is inert in transactivation and in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (9-11).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	31	The C-terminal basic domain has been subjected to extensive analysis, and all evidence suggests that the basic domain is a regulatory domain.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This basic domain can regulate the DNA binding activity when it is phosphorylated (1, 5), acetylated (23-25), deleted (26), or associated with anti-p53 antibody (26, 27) or peptides derived from the C terminus of p53 (28, 29).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Interestingly, the mechanism by which these latter peptides enhance p53 DNA binding activity is the ability of the peptides to interact with three separate domains in p53, that is, the proline-rich domain (30), the DNA binding domain (31), and the C-terminal basic domain (30, 31).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The C-terminal basic domain also interacts with several cellular proteins, such as TFIIH subunits XPB and XPD (32, 33), and Werner syndrome protein (WRN) (34, 35), which all lead to efficient induction of p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These results support a hypothesis that the C-terminal basic domain is a negative regulatory domain whose effect on the DNA binding activity can be alleviated by interacting with other cellular proteins, peptides derived from the p53 C terminus, or other modifications.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, several groups have shown that p53-(BD), which lacks the C-terminal basic domain, has a reduced ability to induce several cellular target genes and becomes incapable of inducing apoptosis (22, 32, 36).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These results suggest that the C-terminal basic domain can regulate p53 activity both positively and negatively.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	38	In this study, we show that activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain form an activation domain for inducing pro-apoptotic genes or inhibiting anti-apoptotic genes.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The C-terminal basic domain is required for maintaining this activation domain competent for transactivation or transrepression.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We also found that an activation domain capable of inducing at least partial cell cycle arrest can be formed by activation domain 1 plus activation domain 2, activation domain 1 plus the proline-rich domain, or activation domain 2 plus the proline-rich domain.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The ability of these activation domains to induce cell cycle arrest can be enhanced by the presence of the C-terminal basic domain.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	67	The Activity of Activation Domain 2 Is Necessary for Inducing Apoptosis-- Previously, we have shown that the activity of activation domain 2 is required for inducing apoptosis when a double point mutation at residues 22-23 or deletion of the N-terminal 42 amino acid residues renders activation domain 1 dysfunctional (10).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	68	 To further determine the function of activation domain 2 in apoptosis, we generated an activation domain 2-deficient mutant, p53-(AD2), which contains a double point mutation at residues 53-54.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	69	 We then established several cell lines that inducibly express this mutant in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	71	 After normalization to the levels of actin protein expressed, we found that the levels of p53 protein in p53-(AD2)-6 and -8 cells were comparable with that in p53-3 and HA p53-15 cells, which express wild-type p53 and HA-tagged wild-type p53, respectively (Fig.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	93	Previously, several studies have shown that the C-terminal basic domain is necessary for inducing apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest (22, 32).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To determine whether this domain has any effect on the ability of p53-(AD2) to induce growth suppression, we generated p53-(AD2BD), which is deficient in activation domain 2 and has a deletion of the C-terminal basic domain.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We found that wild-type p53 was very active (lanes 1-2).

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	203	p53 induces apoptosis but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	204	 To determine this mechanism, two major questions need to be addressed.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	205	 What domains in p53 are required and is p53 transcriptional activity necessary for inducing apoptosis? Previous attempts to answer these questions have been inconclusive, because different experimental systems have been used (1, 2).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These include various types of cell lines and methods to express p53 (transient versus stable, ectopic versus inducible) and different types of p53 mutants (temperature-sensitive mutant versus wild-type p53; point mutations versus deletion mutations).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	207	 To avoid these problems, we have applied the tetracycline inducible expression system to stably express various p53 mutants in p53-null H1299 cells.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	208	 On the basis of the results obtained in this study (Table I) and several previous studies (11, 12, 16, 32, 36, 38-40), including our own (10, 17, 22), we propose the following model for p53 functional domains in apoptosis (Fig.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	209	 First, p53 DNA binding activity is necessary for apoptosis because mutants that are defective in the DNA binding and tetramerization domains are inert.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Second, activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain can form an activation domain for transactivating pro-apoptotic genes or transrepressing anti-apoptotic genes, because mutation or deletion in either one of the domains abrogates the apoptotic activity.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Third, activation domain 1 is not required because deletion of or mutation in activation domain 1 (p53-(AD1), p53-(AD1)) has little effect on apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Fourth, the C-terminal basic domain is necessary for maintaining p53 competent in inducing apoptosis, probably by relieving the inhibitory activity of activation domain 1, because p53-(AD1BD), but not p53-(BD), is capable of inducing apoptosis.

0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	215	Several p53 inducible genes, such as BAX (41), KILLER/DR5 (42), and several PIGs (43), may participate in the apoptotic process.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These genes can be induced by either p53-(PRD) (17) or p53-(AD2) (data not shown), both of which are active in inducing cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis, suggesting that these genes are not required or insufficient for inducing apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Recent evidence has shown that p53 can repress specific genes, such as MAP4 (44).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	218	 It is possible that transrepression of anti-apoptotic genes plays an important role in p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Therefore, the cell lines that inducibly express the p53 mutants described in this study, especially p53-(AD1BD), can be used to identify and determine whether a cellular gene is necessary for mediating p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	220	p53 transcriptional activity has been shown to be necessary for inducing cell cycle arrest (1, 2, 4, 45).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In this study, we extend this observation.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We found that an activation domain capable of inducing at least partial cell cycle arrest can be formed by activation domain 1 plus activation domain 2, activation domain 1 plus the proline-rich domain, or activation domain 2 plus the proline-rich domain (Table I).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	223	 When two of the three domains, i.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	224	 activation domain 1, activation domain 2, and the proline-rich domain, become dysfunctional, the activity in cell cycle arrest is abrogated (Table I).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	225	 It should be mentioned that p53-(AD1) is defective in inducing cell cycle arrest although two functional domains, i.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	226	 activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain are still intact (22).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	227	 However, when part or all of the residues for activation domain 1 are deleted, as in p53-(1-23) and p53-(AD1), the ability to induce cell cycle arrest is retained.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This suggests that the presence of the mutated activation domain 1 may mask the activity of, or inhibit the interaction of, a potential co-activator (or an adaptor) with the activation domain formed by activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain necessary for transactivation or transrepression.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	229	The search for mediators of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest has identified many cellular p53 target genes (1, 4, 46).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	230	 p21cip1/waf1, a well characterized cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, can mediate cell cycle arrest in G1 when overexpressed (22, 47-51).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Previous studies have shown that p53-(AD1), which is deficient in inducing p21, is incapable of inducing arrest in G1, consistent with the hypothesis that p21 plays an important role in mediating p53-dependent arrest in G1 (22, 40).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	232	 In this study, we found that p53-(AD2) is extremely active in inducing arrest in G1, suggesting that activation domain 1, but not activation domain 2, plays an important role in inducing cell cycle arrest.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	233	 However, p21 is only slightly induced by p53-(AD2) (Fig.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Because p53-(AD1AD2), which is deficient in both activation domain 1 and activation domain 2, is inert in inducing cell cycle arrest (9-11), this suggests that a gene(s) responsible for arrest by p53-(AD2) must be induced.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This is not surprising because DNA damage-induced G1 arrest is delayed but not abolished in p21-null fibroblasts from p21-deficient mice (52, 53).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Therefore, the cell line that inducibly expresses p53-(AD2) can be used to identify other novel gene(s) responsible for G1 arrest.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	237	Previously, several studies have shown that the p53 protein can be cleaved by cellular proteases in cells treated with DNA damaging agents, which leads to formation of several smaller polypeptides with molecular masses ranging from 35-50 kDa (54-58).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In addition, the cleavage of p53 is concomitant with the onset of apoptosis in cells treated with DNA damaging agents, suggesting that the cleaved p53 polypeptides are potent in p53 activity and may participate in the apoptotic process (58).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Interestingly, one of the cleaved p53 polypeptides, p50, is p53-(N23), which lacks the N-terminal 23 residues (58).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	240	 We have shown previously that p53-(N23) is active in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (10).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Thus, the cellular machinery can generate an active but smaller p53 polypeptide that would not be subject to negative regulation by MDM2 (59-63).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is not clear whether p53-(AD1BD) is an in vivo cleavage product of p53.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, because p53-(AD1BD) lacks the MDM2 binding site, it would not be subjected to the negative regulation by MDM2.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, p53-(AD1BD) represents a small but potent, apoptosis-inducing form of p53.
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Recent clinical trials have shown that adenoviruses expressing p53 are effective in treating some advanced forms of human cancers (64, 65).
0.5348685.10982799.html.plaintext.txt	246	 We suggest that p53-(AD1BD) is a good candidate to replace the larger, unwieldy wild-type p53 in cancer gene therapy.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Given that blockade of v-integrins during angiogenesis induces p53 activity, we utilized p53 null mice to elucidate whether loss of p53 can compensate for v-integrin function in neovascularization of the retina.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Murine retinal vascularization was inhibited by systemic administration of an v-integrin antagonist.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, mice lacking p53 were refractory to this treatment, indicating that neovascularization in normal mice depends on v-integrin-mediated suppression of p53.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Blockade of v-integrins during neovascularization resulted in an induction of p21CIP1 in wild type and, surprisingly, in p53 null retinas, indicating that v-integrin ligation regulates p21CIP1 levels in a p53-independent manner.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time an in vivo intracellular mechanism for compensation of integrin function and that p53 and v-integrins act in concert during retinal neovascularization.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	11	We previously found that integrin v3 is preferentially expressed on newly forming blood vessels and is functionally involved in controlling angiogenesis stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor or tumor necrosis factor-, whereas another v-integrin, v5, is functional in vessel formation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor or transforming growth factor- (1, 2).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Importantly, antagonists of v-integrins block neovascularization in various animal models with or without exogenous angiogenic stimulation, including chick chorioallantois, in mouse retina, and in human skin trans- plants in SCID mice, causing apoptosis of proliferating, angiogenic vascular cells (3-8).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This suggests that during vessel formation, v-integrins promote signaling events ultimately promoting vascular cell survival, thereby facilitating neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, whereas 80% of v-integrin null mice die in mid-gestation, 20% of these mice survive until 1 day after birth (9).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Similarly, combinatorial gene knockout of integrin 3 and 5 subunits in mice results in enhanced angiogenesis under certain conditions (10).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This indicates either that mice lacking integrins v3 and v5 could compensate for the function of v-integrins in blood vessel formation or that a function of vascular v-integrins, once expressed but blocked or unligated, is to inhibit neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, at present it is not known whether possible compensatory or redundant mechanisms can mediate blood vessel formation in the absence of functional v-integrins.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Littermates from such matings were used in the neovascularization assay, and genomic DNA from mouse tails was genotyped for p53 by a 3-primer assay as described previously (12).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Newborn mice were injected subcutaneously twice daily, starting within 8 h after birth with 40  microg of cyclo-RGDfV (v antagonist peptide 66203) or cyclo-RADfV (control peptide 69601) (lowercase denotes D-amino acids) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The cyclo-RGDfV peptide binds specifically with high affinity to v3- and v5-integrins and blocks their function both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the cyclo-RADfV peptide is non-functional (3, 7, 8, 13).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	23	 After 2-3 days, the eye globes were taken out, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min followed by 6 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The distance from the head of the optic nerve to the edge of the retinal vasculature at 6-8 different representative points was measured for each retina on the photographs, and the mean vascular radius was calculated.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The mean vascular area between the two retinas in each animal was then calculated, assuming a circular shape of the vasculature.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Without treatment, no difference in vascular areas was observed between p53 heterozygous and p53 null mice, and therefore, to standardize and compare the results from different litters, the mean retinal vascular area in p53 null mice in each litter was considered to represent a fully developed vasculature.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	28	 All p53 genotyping and measurements of the retinal vasculature were performed in a double-blind fashion to avoid any bias.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	29	 For measurements of wild type retinas, the mean vascular area of control treated retinas was considered as fully developed and compared with anti-v-treated retinas within the same litters.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For Western blot analysis, retinas were fixed only in cold methanol and dissected.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Retinas were then lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (5) using 1  microg/ml anti-p21CIP1WAF-1/CIP-1 polyclonal antibodies (ab-5, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), anti-v cytoplasmic tail polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa).

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	33	Interestingly, inhibition of angiogenesis by blockade of v-integrins is accompanied by an induction of endothelial cell p53 activity (5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Based on this, we hypothesized that loss of p53 might compensate for v-integrin function during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	35	 To examine this possibility, we analyzed p53 null mice, where the effect of a specific v-integrin antagonist was studied on retinal neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Mouse retinal neovascularization occurs during the first days after birth, and therefore, newborn mice were treated with an v-integrin antagonist as described (7).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The retinal vasculature in wild type newborn mice treated for 3 days with the v-antagonist was significantly less developed than retinas from control treated mice (Table I).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	38	 When accounting for the retinal vascular area already existing when the treatment started, the inhibition was close to 100%, in accordance with our previous observations after 4 days of treatment (7).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Targeted p53 null males were then mated with p53 heterozygous females.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This type of mating was not only necessary for sufficient embryonic survival but also allowed for a comparison of p53 null mice with heterozygous mice within the same litter in a double-blind fashion, including animals of exactly the same age receiving identical treatment.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	41	 No difference in retinal vascularization could be observed between p53 null and heterozygous mice during the first 3 days (data not shown).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In addition, no difference in degree of neovascularization between p53 null and heterozygous mice could be observed after control treatment (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This indicates that p53 does not influence normal vascularization of the retina.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We then treated entire litters of newborn mice of a mixed genotype (see above) with the v-integrin antagonist.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Interestingly, p53 heterozygous animals had a markedly less developed retinal vasculature compared with p53 null mice when treated with the v-antagonist (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Statistical analysis of measurements performed on the vascular area of these retinas revealed that the vascular development in anti-v-treated p53 heterozygous was suppressed, a suppression that was found to be statistically significant (p = 5.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This result closely resembled the difference seen between retinas from antagonist versus control treated wild type mice (Table I).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Taken together, these findings indicate that although p53 expression does not influence normal neovascularization, loss of p53 compensates for the function of v-integrins in neovascularization.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	61	A possible explanation for the lack of response to the v-integrin antagonist in p53 null mice could be deficient retinal integrin v expression.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	62	 To test this possibility, retinal lysates were analyzed for v protein levels by Western blot analysis.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	63	 2A, v-integrin levels in p53 null retinas do not differ from that in p53 heterozygous mice.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Another possibility for a lack of response to the v antagonist in p53 null mice could be that cells lacking p53 are insensitive to this treatment because of alterations in v-integrin function at the cell surface.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To examine this possibility, we examined v-integrin function of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, including their responsiveness to the v-integrin antagonist and compared them to mouse fibroblasts expressing p53.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	66	 2B, the responsiveness to the antagonist in inhibiting v-dependent attachment to vitronectin was virtually identical in p53 null fibroblasts and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, demonstrating that lack of p53 does not cause a general insensitivity to v-integrin antagonists.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These findings reveal that loss of p53 does not affect expression levels or general function of v-integrins.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Instead, we conclude that intracellular events involving p53 mediate the inhibition of neovascularization by v antagonists, events that may be related to the activation of endothelial cell p53 that we previously observed upon v-integrin blockage during angiogenesis (5).

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In fact, in addition to regulating p53, ligation of integrin v3 in endothelial cells also suppresses p21CIP1 protein levels during angiogenesis (5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In UV-irradiated fibroblasts, p53 exerts its functional effect on cell cycle arrest by transcriptional activation of the Cdk inhibitor p21CIP1 (14).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	79	 2C, blockade of v-integrin during neovascularization induces p21CIP1 levels in wild type and in p53 heterozygous retinas.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Surprisingly, whereas untreated p53 null mice display no detectable p21CIP1, the numeric increase in p21CIP1 levels by anti-v treatment of these mice is similar to what is observed in wild type mice, resulting in a higher relative increase.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This indicates that the regulation of p21CIP1 by integrin v during neovascularization is independent of p53.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Furthermore, the fact that p21CIP1 is induced in p53 null retinas upon blockade of v-integrins while neovascularization is still active suggests that this induction of p21CIP1 is not sufficient to block neovascularization, although we cannot exclude that the somewhat higher total levels of p21CIP1 in heterozygous animals might contribute to this blockade.

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	84	Studies using targeted gene knockout mice have in some cases revealed surprising results in that expected phenotypes were not found.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This is particularly surprising for molecules found to play a role in certain in vivo events by previous loss of function studies, including for integrin v and the capacity for at least 20% of v-integrin null mice to form blood vessels (9) and for the capacity of integrin 3 and 5 subunit combinatorial gene knockouts to support enhanced pathological angiogenesis (10).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In some cases, combinatorial knockout of two or three related genes has demonstrated compensatory mechanisms by displaying phenotypes missing in single gene knockout mice.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, it is unclear as to how the functions of v-integrins can be compensated for.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	88	 To this end, although it does not represent the only possible mechanism of v-integrin compensation, our finding that p53 null mice form blood vessels in the absence of functional v-integrins that are critical in wild type mice reveals the first in vivo example of an intracellular mechanism that is able to compensate for loss of integrin function.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	89	Alternatively, the function of v-integrins in neovascularization in wild type animals may be to negatively regulate and balance vessel formation in an unfavorable extracellular matrix environment in order to prevent angiogenesis in inappropriate locations.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Such a function of v-integrins would then lead to enhanced angiogenesis when v3 is lacking as suggested by Reynolds et al.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	91	 In support of this model, caspase-8 was activated at the cell surface in other cell types by unligated integrin v3, thereby causing apoptosis (15).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This mechanism might be related to p53, because caspase-8 plays a role in certain p53-induced apoptosis (16).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Nevertheless, in both alternative models for the function of v-integrins, our results suggest that p53 may mediate v-integrin regulation of cell survival during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	94	Neovascularization is a critical component of tumor growth, where a tumor is unable to grow beyond a minimal size without new blood vessels (17).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In fact, we previously observed that v-integrin antagonists could block the growth of human tumors in animal models (3, 4).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	96	 In addition, uncontrolled ocular neovascularization is a major cause of blindness in various ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Integrins v3 and v5 may be involved in the regulation of neovascularization of these diseases as systemic treatment with v-integrin antagonists block retinal neovascularization (7, 8).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This suggests that v-integrin antagonists constitute a potential therapy for ocular diseases and cancer.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism for this potential anti-angiogenic treatment actively involves p53, similar to what was recently indicated for angiostatin and TNP-470 (18-20).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	100	We were unable to detect apoptosis in the retinal vasculature because of an obscuring background with a large number of apoptotic cells in the whole mounts of developing retinas with no apparent differences between the groups (data not shown).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	101	 However, previous studies in other models clearly demonstrate that blocking of v-integrins during neovascularization leads to vascular cell apoptosis (3, 5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	102	 This suggests that the inhibition of vessel formation by v antagonists may be caused by induction of apoptosis of the forming vascular cells, and the fact that vascular formation in p53 null mice is refractory to v antagonist treatment suggests that these vessels do not undergo apoptosis (Fig.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Whereas p53 may mediate v-integrin-regulated apoptosis in vascular cells, induction of p53 by loss of integrin ligation does not constitute a generic mechanism for regulation of cell survival in all cells and by all integrins.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	104	 For example, ligation of integrin 31 in an in vitro model of mammary epithelial cells lead to apoptosis only in the absence of functional p53 (21), a mechanism that appears to be the opposite of our findings on vascular cell integrin v3 and p53 during neovascularization.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate whether downstream integrin signaling pathways such as activation of ERKs1 might be involved in the regulation of p53, because ERK1/2 signaling was identified as another critical v-integrin-mediated event during angiogenesis (22).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether the p53-mediated response to v antagonist treatment in vascular cells is functionally related to activation of caspase-8 by unligated v3 (15).

0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In neovascularization of wild type animals (left), v3-and/or v5-integrins are activated (1, 2).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The v-integrins are then allowed to ligate to their provisional matrix, a ligation that is necessary to keep endothelial cell p53 inactive and cells surviving (vascularization is facilitated (3, 5)).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	111	 When v-integrins are blocked in wild type animals (middle) and thereby prevented from forming clusters, endothelial cell p53 activity is induced, and the vascular cells undergo apoptosis leading to a block of blood vessel formation (5).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	112	 However, when p53 is absent during vascularization, inhibition of v-integrins does not affect the formation of viable vessels (right).
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Taken together, this suggests that p53 and v-integrins are linked into the same pathway in the control of blood vessel formation.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	114	 VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	115	In conclusion, we demonstrate that loss of p53 compensates for the function of v-integrins in retinal neovascularization, possibly by interfering with v-integrin regulation of vascular cell apoptosis.
0.4913497.11856728.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This indicates a critical function for v-integrin ligation during neovascularization in suppressing p53 and that p53 constitutes an important part of the control of neovascularization.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We showed previously that p53 can block the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py ori-DNA) in vitro when p53 binding sites are present on the late side of the Py ori.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here we have both further extended these observations and have also examined whether p53 might be able to bind directly to and inhibit the replication of damaged DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We found that p53 strongly inhibits replication of -irradiated Py ori-DNA and such inhibition requires both the central DNA binding domain and the extreme C-terminus of the p53 protein.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	10	 An endogenous p53 binding site lies within the Py origin and is required for the ability of p53 to block initiation of replication from -irradiated Py ori-DNA, suggesting the possibility of DNA looping caused by p53 binding both non-specifically to sites of DNA damage and specifically to the endogenous site in the polyomavirus origin.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our results thus suggest the possibility that under some circumstances p53 might serve as a direct regulator of DNA replication and suggest as well an additional function for cooperation between its two autonomous DNA binding domains.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein accumulates in the nuclei of cells in response to various forms of stress including DNA damage.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Once stabilized, p53 can arrest cells in G1 and/or G2 or cause apoptosis, through its functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator (for reviews, see 1 to 3).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The p53 protein possesses structural domains that are characteristic of transcriptional activators including an activation region at its N-terminus, a sequence-specific DNA binding region within its central portion and an oligomerization domain within its C-terminal region.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition to genes regulating cell cycle and cell death, p53 can stimulate the transcription of genes encoding products that can affect both DNA synthesis and repair.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For example, one of the most well studied p53 target genes is p21/CIP1/WAF1, which can both inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (4) and also bind to and inactivate PCNA, which plays an essential role in DNA replication by facilitating processive DNA synthesis by polymerase (5).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Moreover, p53 activates both the RRM2B/p53R2 gene (6) and the DDB2 (damage-specific DNA binding protein 2) gene (7,8) that each plays distinct roles in DNA repair.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	18	Although as mentioned above p53 protein embodies the classical features of a sequence-specific transcriptional activator, it has one property that is rather unique, which is that it possesses a second essentially autonomous DNA binding region at its extreme C-terminus (9).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This region of the protein has been shown to facilitate and be required for the interaction of p53 with various forms of damaged or altered DNA including deletion/insertion mismatches, DNA ends, as well as double- and single-strand breaks (for a review, see 10).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The function of this region is not fully clarified and it has also been shown to be able to regulate the mode by which the central region recognizes DNA (for a review, see 11).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	21	Although p53 is clearly involved in regulating the transcription of numerous targets, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that p53 may play transcription- independent roles in cells as well.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Some mutant p53 proteins that have lost transcriptional transactivation capacity retain their ability to arrest cell growth to varying extents (12 to 16).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Conversely, loss of growth suppressor function has been reported in some p53 mutants, which retain transcriptional activity (17 to 19).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (20) showed that when cells are treated with the DNA-damaging drug camptothecin, p53 accumulation rather than the transactivation of p21 is required for the G1 arrest, strongly suggesting that p53 may play transcription-independent role(s) in cells.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In fact it is possible that under some conditions p53 may play a direct role in regulating DNA synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Various experimental results suggest that p53 protein may inhibit DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The C-terminally truncated form of p53 protein, p53C30, which is also the DNA binding active form of p53 protein, was reported to inhibit Xenopus nuclear DNA replication in a transcription-independent manner (21).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	28	 p53 may inhibit the initiation of DNA replication directly by binding to RP-A (22 to 24), which is a single-stranded DNA binding protein required for DNA replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	29	 p53 protein also blocks the replication of SV40 DNA in vitro by binding to and inactivating the SV40 large T antigen (25 to 27).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Additionally, although p53 protein does not bind to or inhibit polyoma large T antigen, it is also able to inhibit the replication of polyomavirus origin-containing DNA (Py ori-DNA) in vitro although in this case it is necessary for p53-specific binding sites to be present in the template origin-containing plasmid (28).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	31	There have also been reports supporting the possibility of role(s) for p53 in regulating and responding to altered DNA replication in vivo.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	32	 When DNA synthesis is blocked, p53 inhibits entry into mitosis (29), and in several cell lines p53 is transcriptionally dysfunctional when DNA synthesis is blocked (30).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	33	 p53 protein prevents mammalian DNA reduplication, following the release from the mitotic spindle checkpoint, in a transcription-independent manner (13).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition, p53 inhibits the replication of Py and papillomavirus origin-containing DNAs in a cell-specific way: p53 represses replication of both viral origins in human and Chinese hamster cells, but fails to do so in mouse cells (31 to 33).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Further evidence supporting the possibility for a direct interaction between p53 and the DNA replication machinery is provided by the observations that p53 is localized to foci of replication in the nuclei of herpes virus-infected cells (34) and that p53 is imported into the nucleus of Xenopus oocyte upon fertilization, although the first 12 rapid cell cycles occur without transcription of the genome (35).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	36	To continue to explore possible alternative roles and functions of p53, in this study we tested the possibility that p53 affects the replication of damaged DNA templates.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We found that p53 can block the initial stage of replication of a -irradiated plasmid containing the Py replication origin.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Such inhibition requires both specific binding by the p53 core domain and non-specific binding by its C-terminus.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	69	 8 for depiction of Py ori and early and late sides).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Moreover, in that study two tumor-derived core domain p53 mutants, Trp-248 and His-273, were shown to be unable to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	71	 These findings implicated sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 as a requirement for its ability to repress Py ori-DNA replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	72	 To confirm and extend these studies we examined the ability of various forms of p53, each differing in their ability to bind to DNA, to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT in mouse FM3A cell extracts.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Note that although FM3A cells have been reported to contain wild-type p53 whose protein levels are increased after UV irradiation (40), the extracts used in our experiments are from unstressed cells and contain little or no detectable p53 (data not shown).

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	80	  It was shown previously by Jayaraman et al.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	81	 (39) that N-terminally HA-tagged p53 protein that had been immunopurified using an affinity column containing the C-terminal-specific monoclonal antibody PAb421, HA to p53 [PAb421], is more active in sequence-specific DNA binding than a similarly purified p53 protein preparation (HA to p53 [flu]) in which the affinity column contained the HA antibody (mAb12.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The basis for this difference is not fully understood but may be related to the observations that interactions of PAb421 with the p53 C-terminus can in some cases stimulate its ability to bind to DNA (41).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	83	 It has also been shown that p53 purified in the absence of reducing agents (HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT]) is inert in DNA binding (39,42,43).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In contrast, as is well-documented, p53 lacking the C-terminus (HA to p53C30 [flu]) can bind extremely well to DNA (41,44).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	85	 These four different forms of HA-tagged p53 were prepared and tested for their ability to affect replication of Vw16PyCAT Py ori-DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	86	 As expected, equivalent quantities of these p53 protein preparations, HA to p53C30 [flu], HA to p53 [PAb421], HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT], have descending affinities for an oligonucleotide probe, which contains three copies of the RGC site (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The abilities of the different forms of p53 protein to inhibit the replication of Vw16PyCAT in vitro as measured both by incorporation of labeled deoxynucleotide into progeny DNA (Fig.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	89	 1D) reflected their relative abilities to bind to DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Note that the presence of DpnI-resistant DNA suggested that all the dAMP incorporation measured was produced by replication synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	91	 We then tested a core domain  hot-spot  p53 mutant, HA to p53His to 175 [flu], as well as an N-terminally mutated form of p53, HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu], which has been shown to be defective in transactivation of p53 target genes but active in sequence-specific DNA binding (45).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	92	 As shown in Figure 2, both wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] bound to the oligonucleotide probe containing three copies of RGC sites to similar extents, while, as expected, HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to interact with the RGC sites.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Correspondingly, wild-type HA to p53 [flu] and HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] inhibited replication of Vw16PyCAT in a dose-dependent fashion while HA to p53His to 175 [flu] failed to do so.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Our results thus strongly support the conclusion that the essential feature required for p53 to block DNA replication is specific binding to the Py ori-DNA template.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Furthermore, the fact that HA to p53Gln to 22/Ser to 23 [flu] functions like wild-type HA to p53 [flu] in inhibiting the replication of Vw16PyCAT suggests that this inhibition does not require interaction of the N-terminus with cellular proteins that bind to its activation domain.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	118	 We did not, however, determine whether the interaction of p53 with this site was required for p53 to block replication of constructs containing binding sites on the late side of the origin.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Interestingly, while in the absence of p53, Vw16PyCATBSM2 had a replication efficiency close to that of Vw16PyCAT, Vw16PyCATBSM1 replicated 3 to 4-fold more efficiently than the other two plasmids (data not shown).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Since the endogenous p53 binding site is located between two T antigen binding consensus pentanucleotides spanning nucleotides 62 to 66 and 95 to 99, it may be that the weaker T-A base pairs constructed in PyORI-BSM1 make it easier for T antigen to unwind the origin DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In the presence of HA to p53 [flu] protein the replication of Vw16PyCATBSM2 was inhibited even more efficiently than the replication of Vw16PyCAT, while the replication of Vw16PyCATBSM1 was not affected at all by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	151	 DNA products were purified and analyzed by DpnI digestion.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	152	  Although in the presence of T antigen, the majority of dAMP incorporation in vitro using -irradiated pBE102 as a template is likely due to replication synthesis, the possibility cannot be excluded that repair synthesis as detected by labeled deoxynucleotide incorporation could also be inhibited by p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Therefore, DpnI resistance of the replication products was examined in order to distinguish replication synthesis from repair synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Interestingly, HA to p53 [flu] inhibited exclusively replication synthesis, while repair synthesis was not affected (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	155	 To verify this result, we further examined the ability of HA to p53 [flu] to affect the repair of -irradiated pBE102 in the absence of T antigen where virtually all of the nucleotides were incorporated at sites of repair synthesis and here too HA to p53 [flu] did not affect these activities (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Thus, our results show that p53 can specifically inhibit the replication but not the repair of a radiation damaged Py ori-DNA template.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	157	Since the C-terminus is required for the interaction of p53 with irradiated DNA (46), we tested whether this region is necessary for the ability of p53 to block the replication of damaged ori-DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	158	 As shown in Figure 5A, among the four different forms of p53 protein used in Figure 1, only HA to p53 [PAb421] and HA to p53 [flu] inhibited the replication of -irradiated pBE102.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In fact HA to p53 [flu] was relatively more effective in blocking the synthesis of damaged ori-DNA than of intact ori-DNA containing RGC binding sites.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Neither HA to p53C30 [flu], nor the oxidized HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT], inhibited the replication of -irradiated pBE102.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Thus, while the C-terminus of p53 is not required to block the replication of plasmids bearing p53 binding sites, it is indispensable for p53 inhibition of replication of damaged plasmids.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The fact that HA to p53 [flu,  to DTT] was inert, however, suggested that sequence-specific DNA binding by p53 is also a component of its repressive effect on replication of damaged ori-DNA.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	170	  Inhibition of the replication of -irradiated pBE102 requires the endogenous p53 binding site The fact that the endogenous p53 binding site on the late side of the origin is required for the inhibition of replication of plasmids bearing p53 binding sites, led to the question as to whether this site is also required for the inhibitory effect of p53 on -irradiated pBE102.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	171	 To test this, plasmids pBE102BSM1 and pBE102BSM2 were constructed, which have the endogenous p53 binding site mutated to BSM1 and BSM2, respectively (as shown in Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Indeed, in contrast to wild-type or pBE102BSM2, the replication of -irradiated pBE102BSM1 was not inhibited by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	173	 5C), indicating that the endogenous p53 binding site is required for p53 to inhibit the replication of radiation damaged Py ori-DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	174	It remained possible that the ability of p53 to bind to irradiated DNA might facilitate its ability to inhibit replication of pBE102 by a mechanism that does not require irradiation of the pBE102 plasmid itself.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, p53 might bind simultaneously to an irradiated plasmid with its C-terminus and to another unirradiated plasmid through interaction of its central domain with the endogenous binding site and this would somehow prevent replication of the unirradiated plasmid.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	176	 To test this we mixed untreated pBE102 and -irradiated pBluescript, which does not have the Py origin and therefore does not support DNA replication with the Py large T antigen-complemented in vitro DNA replication system.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It was observed that the endogenous p53 binding site and DNA lesion(s) caused by -irradiation do not work in trans in making DNA replication inhibited by HA to p53 [flu] (Fig.

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It is thus possible to determine whether p53 inhibition of DNA replication occurs at the elongation or initiation stage by adding it to replication mixtures either before or after addition of deoxynucleotides.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Pre-incubation with T antigen was carried out for 10 min and then HA to p53 [flu] protein (600 ng) was added and incubated for a further 10 min, followed by the addition of deoxynucleotides to allow elongation (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	188	 DNA replication after this treatment was compared with that in replication reaction mixtures when HA to p53 [flu] was added without pre- incubation (compare lane 3 with lane 5, lane 4 with lane 6).

0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	197	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In this study we extended our previous conclusion that p53 must bind specifically to undamaged Py ori-DNA in order to block its replication and showed that the endogenous p53 binding site adjacent to the core Py origin is essential for this inhibition.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Further, we found that DNA lesion(s) caused by ionizing radiation can also recruit p53 and thereby facilitate its inhibition of replication of the damaged DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Taken together our results show that for the replication of Py DNA to be inhibited by p53 protein, the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side of the origin, as well as other strong p53 interactions with the template, are required.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These interactions can be mediated either by its central core or its C-terminal domains.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	201	Do our results reflect the possibility that virtually any DNA binding protein when present in sufficiently high quantities may inhibit replication of radiation damaged ori-DNA? Arguing against this are our results showing that (28) p53 needs to be able to interact specifically with the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side of the ori as well as with DNA lesions caused by irradiation, (i) p53 needs both its specific and non-specific DNA binding domains to cause this inhibition, and (ii) p53 blocks specifically the initiation and not the elongation stage of ori-DNA synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, it is unlikely that p53 is blocking replication by random non-specific binding to the damaged DNA.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	203	 It is also noteworthy that Ito et al.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	204	 (48) showed that the transcription factor AP1 stimulates the initial stage of in vitro replication of a Py ori-DNA plasmid containing the AP1 binding site.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Their result argues against the possibility that a sequence-specific interactor with DNA in the vicinity of the Py ori will obligatorily inhibit its replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	206	To explain the mechanism underlying the inhibition of Py DNA by p53, several possibilities can be suggested: (i) by binding to flanking consensus sites or lesion site(s), p53 may sequester away proteins which are essential for the replication machinery such as RP-A and T antigen; (ii) p53 binding to a site close to the replication origin, such as the endogenous p53 site of Py DNA, may block access of the replication initiation complex to the origin; (iii) p53 may also function as an anti-helicase (49) and counteract the helicase activity of T antigen by re-annealing denatured DNA around the origin; (iv) by binding to separate sites p53 may loop DNA around the origin and therefore produce steric hindrance to replication initiation.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our results presented in this paper strongly support the DNA looping model (Fig.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	208	 8), because both the endogenous p53 binding site on the early side and an in cis p53 binding site on the late side adjacent to the Py origin are required for the DNA replication to be inhibited by p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It has been shown previously that p53 binding to separate single consensus sequences can indeed bend and loop DNA, and DNA looping by p53 may play an important role in transactivation of certain promoters (50,51).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	210	 So far, it remains to be tested whether p53 can also loop DNA by binding to separate DNA lesions, or as suggested by our result, by separately binding to a consensus sequence and a lesion site(s).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	211	It was interesting to discover that when the endogenous p53 binding site adjacent to the Py origin was mutated to BSM1 (that cannot bind p53), the replication efficiency of the mutant plasmid was increased 3 to 4-fold (data not shown).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The fact that the wild-type polyomavirus genome contains an endogenous p53 binding consensus site provides the intriguing possibility that polyomavirus may indeed use the host p53 protein to regulate amplicational replications.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Amplicational replication of small DNA tumor viruses is normally initiated after entry of the viral genome into the cell nucleus, which leads to a rapid increase in copy number of the virus genome (32).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Amplicational replication of the viral genome is essential for the establishment of viral infection but has to be controlled in order to avoid over-replication and unscheduled death of host cells prior to the synthesis of late genes and the production of infectious particles.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	215	 It is tempting to speculate that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to control amplicational replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Further experiments will be required to test this possibility.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Small DNA tumor viruses generally encode proteins that interact with and modulate the activity of p53 and thereby regulate p53-dependent apoptosis of the host cells.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	218	 For example, the large T antigen of SV40 (26,52), E1B protein of adenovirus (53), x antigen of hepatitis B virus (54,55) and other viral proteins interact with p53 and thereby modulate p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	219	 So far no protein encoded by the Py genome has been identified that interacts with or regulates the activity of p53 protein.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It supports the likelihood that polyomavirus uses p53 as a cellular factor to keep amplicational replication in check.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	221	In the original conception of p53 as a checkpoint factor, it was proposed that DNA damage would induce a transient G1 arrest in cells with wild-type but not mutant p53 to allow time for damaged DNA to be repaired before continuation of the cell cycle (56).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It is tempting to speculate that p53 may participate directly in a pathway that stops or slows down DNA replication more rapidly than the transcription- dependent p21/E2F pathway.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although p53 is believed to interact with various forms of DNA damage through its C-terminus the biological function of this interaction has not been elucidated.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In our study using ionizing radiation damaged Py ori-DNA plasmids we were able to demonstrate by in vitro experiments a potential new function for p53, namely that of direct inhibition of initiation of DNA replication in a DNA binding-dependent manner.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	225	 It should be noted here that a p53-dependent DNA replication checkpoint has not been demonstrated (57), and in fact p53 has been shown to be transcriptionally impaired when it accumulates in blocked S-phase (30).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	226	 What is not known, however, is whether at the very onset of S-phase radiation-damaged templates might be prevented from initiating replication as a result of direct interactions with p53.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	227	 It is acknowledged that the replication of Py ori-DNA embodies several features that are distinct from the as yet poorly understood process of mammalian genomic DNA replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that p53 could only exert its effect on the initial stages of Py-ori DNA synthesis and, once initiated, p53 was ineffective in inhibiting ongoing replication.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Thus, based both on our biochemical observations and the existing body of knowledge of p53 in cells, it is possible that p53 might serve to prevent the onset of S-phase both through its function as a transcription factor and its ability to bind to damaged DNA and prevent initiation of DNA synthesis.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Once S-phase has initiated, it would follow that p53 would no longer be effective in inhibition of pre-initiated replication forks, even if stalled.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	231	It is not clear how often sequence-specific p53 binding sites reside in the vicinity of mammalian replication origins.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	232	 It is intriguing, however, that the two first cellular p53 binding sites to be identified were found in the vicinity of putative human replication origins (58).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The ever-increasing number of transcriptional targets of p53 suggests that there may be large numbers of such binding sites in the genome.
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Besides polyomavirus, specific p53 binding sites have also been identified in the SV40 replication origin (59).
0.61247855.12853603.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It remains to be further studied whether DNA looping by p53 occurs and, as suggested by this study, plays functional roles regulating DNA replication in cells.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   In 1992, when David Lane described p53 as  Guardian of the Genome  (1), he established a paradigm embodying p53 as a tumour suppressor.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In essence, p53 was a DNA damage sensor that acted to prevent the accumulation of genetic lesions that might contribute to tumourigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This model could not only explain the role of p53 in cell-cycle control and apoptosis but also the stabilization of p53 after exposure to UV radiation and other DNA damaging agents, and the need for p53 function to be compromised during tumourigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Indeed, it seemed like the  p53 story  might be solved soon after that time.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The intervening years, however, have clearly demonstrated that this was a naive expectation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We now know that the role of p53 extends to participation in a diverse array of signalling pathways associated with cellular stress and DNA damage (Figure 1), and recent studies have even raised the possibility that p53 may be involved in pathways that have little to do with cancer.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	23	  It was in this light, that on the 25th anniversary of the discovery of p53, the 12th International p53 Workshop was held in Dunedin, New Zealand, in November 2004.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The take home message from this latest biennial gathering of p53 researchers could be summarized in one word,  complexity .
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We learnt that p53 is complex on many levels genomic structure, regulation and function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In fact, it is far more complex than any one of us could have possibly imagined.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This  theme of complexity  was established in the opening address by David Lane and it continued throughout the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In this report, we have endeavoured to cover as many of the oral presentations as possible but inevitably a few have been omitted.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In addition, we have paid particular attention to describing some highlights, areas of new investigation and on-going research that appear to be integral to the p53 field.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Using a technique to ensure that only full-length, capped p53 mRNA molecules were analysed, they identified numerous start sites for transcription: two mRNA species initiated from different start sites in exon 1 (P1 and P1'), and one mRNA was derived from a promoter (P2) within intron 4.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Primers based in exon 11, also identified three splice variants of exon 9.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus, p53 now has a total of 12 possible mRNAs and 9 proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Although it is still the early days, it is clear that the isoforms show different patterns of expression within tissues and cell lines.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A key area of investigation will be to determine how these isoforms function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, one isoform, Np53, is a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type (wt) p53 in transactivation and apoptosis assays, as has been reported for an N-terminal truncation of p73, a relative of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Some of the isoforms of p53 are abundantly expressed in tumours, suggesting a possible role in carcinogenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Furthermore, the existence of dominant negative isoforms provides an explanation for an impaired p53 response in the absence of coding region mutations.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	41	p63/p73 Although not a major feature of this conference, several talks discussed p63 and p73, relatives of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Given the similarity between the different protein isoforms encoded by these genes, and using the domain structure of p53 as a model, X.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	43	Chen (Birmingham, AL, USA) has been mapping domains in the isoforms of p63 and p73 that are critical for transcriptional activation, growth arrest and apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	44	 He showed, in particular, that the two activation domains of p53 (amino acid residues 1 to 42 and 43 to 63) are represented in the full-length and N-terminally deleted (N) versions of both p63 and p73, and are critical for all three functions.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	45	Stiewe (Wurzburg, Germany) showed that reduction of p73 expression was sufficient to induce telomerase activity in telomerase negative cells, suggesting that p73 could be an endogenous repressor of telomerase activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Stiewe also showed that hTERT is downregulated by p73 but upregulated by the ectopic expression of the dominant negative Np73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These data agree with the observations that p73 upregulation accompanies differentiation, which in turn is coupled to a loss of telomerase activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	48	In the absence of functional p53, p73 is phosphorylated and acetylated after DNA damage to activate pro-apoptotic genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	49	 As described below, Pin-1 a propyl isomerase is an important regulator of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	50	Del Sal (Trieste, Italy) has been examining the role of this prolyl-isomerase in the activation of p73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	51	 His studies elegantly demonstrate a clear requirement for Pin-1 in regulating the stability and conformation of p73 after DNA damage, and the ability of p73 to activate gene expression and to induce apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Furthermore, he showed that c-abl regulates the Pin-1 modulation of p73 by phosphorylating amino acid residue tyr99, thus linking p73 into one of the same signalling pathways that regulates p53.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Animal models Models of tumourigenesis p53 in the clinic Regulation of p53 function p53-based therapies p53 the future References   Control of p53 activity is a major area of research activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Essentially, control is exerted on p53 function via post-translational modifications and/or by interacting proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Both areas were well represented at the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	58	Modifications to p53 are thought to be a part of the signalling process that  directs  p53 to carry out a particular task, whether it be cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair or some other process in which p53 plays a role.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, the importance of any particular modification for regulating p53 function is unclear as there are many conflicting reports.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These conflicts, which were evident at this meeting also, may well reflect the use of different assay systems, the analysis of only limited p53 target genes and in vitro versus in vivo approaches.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	61	Post-translational modifications phosphorylation S.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	62	Shieh (Taipei, Taiwan) addressed the role of the checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, in p53 regulation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	63	 She showed that in addition to phosphorylation of known N-terminal residues, phosphorylation on ser313, ser314, thr377 and ser378 were also found.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Furthermore, downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 not only reduced the phosphorylation of ser20 as expected but also reduced the acetylation of lys382, leading to poor induction of the CDKN1A gene encoding the cyclin inhibitory protein p21WAF1/CIP1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The data suggest that Chk1 and Chk2 may regulate p53 function in several ways and not just by N-terminal phosphorylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Such data serve to emphasize the importance of the C-terminus in regulating p53 function, a theme that was repeated throughout the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In addition, it is interesting to note that germline mutations of Chk2 have been found in some Li Fraumeni families that have wt TP53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Further evidence for the apparent complexity in Chk2 regulation of p53 function was provided by Y.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Specific mutation of pro82 prevented binding of Chk2 and Chk2-dependent phosphorylation of ser20 after DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In his attempts to identify the functional relevance of this aspect, Haupt looked at the role of Pin-1 in facilitating the Chk2 modulation of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Previous studies had shown that activation and stabilization of p53 by Pin-1 requires specific phosphorylation of p53 on ser33, tyr81 and tyr150.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Experiments in Pin1 to / to  mouse fibroblasts were used to show that Pin-1 is also essential for phosphorylation at ser23 in mouse p53 (equivalent of ser20 in human p53) and stabilization of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Haupt also showed that Pin-1 enhances formation of Chk2/p53 complexes early after DNA damage and requires pro82.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	74	 He therefore proposed a model in which p53 phosphorylation at specific residues permits binding of Pin-1, which then alters the conformation of p53 to allow binding of Chk2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Chk2 then phosphorylates ser20, thus releasing p53 from Mdm-2 and stabilizing/activating p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	76	 A similar conclusion with respect to phosphorylation and the role of Pin-1 in regulating the interaction between p53 and Mdm-2, was reached by G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	77	Prives (New York, USA) was unable to demonstrate any N-terminal phosphorylation of mouse p53 by Chk2 after DNA damage, and downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2 by siRNA failed to affect p53 function before or after DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Further, questioning the importance of phosphorylation in regulating p53 function, L.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	79	Manfredi's group, New York, USA), using an artificial system involving tetracycline-regulated p53 expression and therefore not involving DNA damage, reported that p53 is not phosphorylated on ser6 and only poorly phosphorylated on ser15 and ser37 and yet binds DNA very efficiently, at least to the p53 response element in the CDKN1A promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Furthermore, using proteosome inhibitors to elevate p53 levels, she showed that DNA binding, either in vitro or in vivo was not affected by the absence of phosphorylation on ser15 and ser392, and no acetylation at lys382.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	81	 So, if post-translational modifications are not required for p53 activity, what are they required for? A probable answer is that p53 may carry out many functions once it has reached a threshold concentration.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	82	 It may need to be  told  to activate a specific promoter by processes, such as phosphorylation or acetylation or by interacting proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	83	Braithwaite (Dunedin, NZ) also failed to observe phosphorylation on N-terminal residues using hormone inducible p53, but still obtained activation of the CDKN1A and MDM-2 promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	84	 However, no induction of the NOXA or BAX promoters was observed.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	85	Some support for the idea that phosphorylation on specific residues controls p53 specificity, at least in part, came from the presentation by S.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Phosphorylation on ser46 is known to be important for p53 to induce apoptosis, at least in some instances, yet the kinase responsible for ser46 phosphorylation is unknown.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The data from Soddu's work suggested that the enzyme could be HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting kinase 2), a member of a novel ser/thr kinase family.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Her studies were initiated by an observation that thyroid papillary tumours (TPA) have wt p53 and yet high levels of the anti-apoptotic protein galectin-3, expression of which is normally repressed by wt p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Soddu showed that these tumours have allelic loss on chr7q32 to 34, which encompasses the HIPK2 gene locus and that wt p53 can only repress galectin-3, when HIPK2 is present.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	90	 So, HIPK2 activates an apoptotic pathway that involves phosphorylation of p53 on ser46 and inhibition of the p53-mediated repression of galectin-3.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	91	Ubiquitination, Mdm-2 and the control of p53 stability It seems clear from the above discussion that much of the activity of p53 is dependent on its concentration (also discussed later).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Thus, it is not only post-translational modifications, but also the level of p53 that must be regulated precisely.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In a comprehensive analysis of enzymes required for ubiquitination of p53, D.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	94	Lane (Dundee, Scotland) identified UbcH5B/C as an E2-like protein involved in controlling the levels of p53 and Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Knockdown of UbcH5B/C increased levels of p53, but this p53 was transcriptionally inactive being still bound to Mdm-2, which is also modified by UbcH5B/C.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Activation of the stabilized p53 thus requires the removal of bound Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	97	 These results in conjunction with the recent discovery that both p53 and Mdm-2 can be modified by the ubiquitin-like NEDD8, a well-characterized regulator of p27kip1 and IB levels, demonstrate that there are now at least two pathways resulting in ubiquitination and inactivation of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Both pathways involve Mdm-2 in a two-step stabilization and subsequent inactivation of p53: the NEDD pathway and UbcH5B/C that ubiquitinate both p53 and Mdm-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Understanding of this new complexity for p53 regulation has important implications for the design and use of therapeutic modulators of the p53/Mdm-2 interaction.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	100	 In addition, work presented by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	101	Melino's group, Leicester, UK) showed that both p63 and p73 are also subject to tight control by ubiquitin-like degradation processes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	102	 He reported on the discovery of a new NEDD-like E3 ligase called Aip4/Itch that downregulates p73 upon DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	103	Consistent with these and other data presented at the meeting, G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	104	Wahl (La Jolla, USA) showed that in normal fibroblasts, DNA damage induces phosphorylation of ser15 on p53, but this occurred 2 h prior to induction of CDKN1A or MDM-2.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This means that phosphorylation of ser15 does not always equate to  active  p53 protein.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	106	 During this time however, p53 becomes much more stable, as Mdm-2 becomes unstable.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Proteosome inhibitors (to block Mdm-2 degradation) inhibited the transactivation function of p53 in this system, suggesting that the decrease in Mdm-2 stability contributed to p53 activation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, if there is sufficient DNA damage, Mdm-2 stability is reduced and p53 becomes activated without a requirement for phosphorylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	109	 These data provide a possible explanation for how p53 can be functional in the absence of N-terminal phosphorylation and also in p53 mutants lacking conserved serine and threonine residues (see above).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Thus, once again p53 level may be the critical determiner of function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	111	To add to the complexity of Mdm-2 regulation, M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	112	Oren (Rehovot, Israel) described studies reporting that Mdm-2 can directly bind the core histones and Mdm-2 mono-ubiquitinates H2A and H2B in vitro.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In a GAL4 DNA-binding reporter system, Mdm-2 repressed transcription from a GAL4-response promoter, suggesting that Mdm-2 might repress transcription via changes to chromatin.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Using ChiP analysis, Oren also showed that Mdm-2 can complex with p53 on the CDKN1A promoter in vivo and ubiquitinate residues on H2B.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The data imply that Mdm-2 may drive gene silencing in its own right via chromatin modification.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	116	New p53-binding proteins In common with agents that induce post-translational modifications of p53, p53-binding proteins appear important in  instructing  a specific response from p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The list of these proteins continues to expand, and several new members were discussed at the meeting.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	118	Taya (Tokyo, Japan) reported that the cytoplasmic protein, clathrin, which normally plays a role in the formation of  coated pits  in vesicle transport, binds p53 and influences its function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	119	 He reported that clathrin binds the N-terminus and to the S46F mutant in particular.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Interestingly, phosphorylation of this residue is reported to be important for the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis (see data reported by Soddu).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	121	 He went on to show by transfection and reporter assays, that clathrin enhanced p53-dependent activation of apoptosis inducing protein 1 (AIP1) and other p53-dependent promoters, which was particularly marked for the S46F mutant.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In addition, RNAi studies showed that downregulation of clathrin partially ablated the ability of p53 to transactivate several target genes after UV exposure.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	123	Binding of p53 by the Y-box factor, YB1, was reported by A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	124	 YB1 binds the C-terminus of p53 and like clathrin, is generally located in the cytoplasm.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	125	 YB1 translocates to the nucleus in response to various stresses and regulates transcription of several tumour-associated genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In tumours, nuclear localization and over-expression of YB1 are associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Braithwaite showed that YB1 requires a transcriptionally active p53 for translocation and does not appear to require direct binding.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Once in the nucleus, he showed that YB1 partially inhibits p53 activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Genes such as BAX and NOXA involved in apoptosis were inhibited by YB1, but CDKN1A and MDM-2 were not inhibited.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, knockdown of YB1 with antisense oligonucleotides increased NOXA expression in a p53-dependent manner.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Braithwaite proposed that YB1 reduces the ability of p53 to bind target promoters of low affinity, such as those in the apoptotic pathway, and that this partial inhibition of p53 function may contribute to cancer formation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	132	A very interesting p53 binding partner discovered 2 years ago by G.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	133	Del Sal (Trieste, Italy), is Pin-1, a propyl-isomerase.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Pin-1 induces a conformational change on phosphorylated p53 facilitating further post-translational modifications, particularly acetylation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In this sense it is an important regulator of p53 function and is often over-expressed in common human cancers, such as prostate and breast.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Pin-1 also influences p53 regulation by Mdm-2 (see Haupt) and appears to have analogous effects on p73.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	137	Lu (London, UK) expanded her work on the pro-apoptotic ASPP (so-called because they comprise Ankrin repeats, SH3 domains and a Poly Proline domain) proteins and their effect on p53 function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The ankyrin repeats bind p53 within the N-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	139	 It is of interest to note that, the polymorphism arg72 binds ASPP to a lesser extent than pro72.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	140	 When ASPP proteins bind p53, they augment the ability of p53 to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes, but have no effect on the ability of p53 to transactivate cell-cycle genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Although data were presented showing a similar selective influence by ASPP proteins for p73 and p63, much of the talk was focused on the regulation of ASPP function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Biochemical studies showed that ASPP1 is a substrate for MAP-kinase (MAPK), and that both ASPP1 and ASPP2 are stabilized by MAPK.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Interestingly, RNAi downregulation of ras, inhibited ASPP1 and ASPP2 mediated p53-dependent apoptosis, demonstrating that ASPP proteins link p53-dependent apoptosis to a ras-signalling pathway.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In studies looking at transcriptional regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2, they found binding motifs for E2F-3 (ASPP1, 4; ASPP2, 2 common to ASPP1) in both promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	145	 That E2F-1 could bind these motifs was confirmed by in vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP) and in vitro (reporter) assays.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	146	 E2F-3 was also shown to activate both promoters.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	147	 However, only E2F-1 and E2F-2 can strongly activate the ASPP2 promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Transfection of E2F-1 was able to induce ASPP1 and ASPP2 mRNA, leading to a proposal that induction of ASPP1 and ASPP2 by E2F-1 might sensitize cells to apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	149	Finally, the importance of TGFss as a regulator of p53 function was discussed by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Using cells derived from TGFss1 knockout mice, she found that radiation induced p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis were defective.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The defect was associated with an absence of ser15 phosphorylation but no overall change in p53 levels was observed and there was also no direct interaction between TGFss and p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In addition, studies with small molecule inhibitors of TGFss signalling led to a similar conclusion that TGFss is a regulator of the p53 DNA damage response.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Additional evidence of a link between the TGFss and p53 pathways, was provided by M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	154	Agarwal (Cleveland, USA) who showed that TGFss mediates a p53-dependent protective cell-cycle arrest in response to dNTP imbalance.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In simple terms, the process can be divided into three parts: (i) what tells p53 to induce apoptosis, (ii) what mechanisms are involved and (iii) what the downstream effectors are.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The first part has been dealt with above and often involves post-translational modifications and/or interactions with other proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This session of the meeting dealt principally with the latter two components.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	161	For many years it was thought that, like induction of cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis by p53 was due solely to the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, transactivation-independent apoptosis does occur in some cells.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This area has been pioneered by U.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	164	Moll (New York, USA) who believes that p53 induces mitochondrial apoptosis directly.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In support of this, she showed convincing evidence of p53 associating with mitochondria.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This association occurred only during p53-dependent apoptosis and in radiosensitive tissues, such as spleen and thymus, and was earlier to transactivation.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	167	 She also showed that p53 binds the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl to 2 and Bcl-xL.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Using modelling techniques she predicted that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL would bind p53 within the central, specific DNA-binding domain.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Using the classic cytochrome C (cyt C) release assay, she showed that tumour-derived mutants of p53 are defective for binding Bcl-xL and prevent cyt C release from mitochondria.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	170	Murphy (Philadelphia, USA) provided independent evidence that certain p53 mutants (those that cannot oligomerize) fail to bind Bak and as a consequence are defective for p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	171	 These data suggest that tumour-derived mutants have a double-hit, i.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	172	 they cannot induce mitochondrial death and are transcriptionally inactive too!.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	173	Further support for a direct role of p53 at the mitochondrion was provided by D.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	174	Green (San Diego, USA) who has developed a sophisticated model system using isolated outer and inner mitochondrial membrane vesicles, as well as synthetic lipid vesicles containing dextran, to examine how individual Bcl-2 family proteins function.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	175	 During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family act to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membranes, without a requirement for the inner membranes or mitochondrial proteins.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	176	 As a result, cyt C is released in a manner that is sudden, rapid and complete.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Using this system, he looked at induction of apoptosis by p53 in intact cells and cytoplasts and concluded that the nucleus is dispensable for apoptosis! To further look at the function of endogenous p53 in apoptosis, he purified native p53 from various cell lines after UV treatment, as well as several p53 mutants including Pro (deleted the polyproline domain between residues 62 and 92) and examined their interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins and their ability to induce cyt C release.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Based on these studies, he proposed a model whereby after stabilization, p53 accumulates in the cytoplasm but is held  inactive  by Bcl-xL.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Nuclear p53 then activates BAX and PUMA transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Puma accumulates in the cytoplasm and p53 is liberated from Bcl-xL by Puma.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Bax can then be activated by p53, cyt C is released and cell death occurs.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	182	Strasser (Melbourne, Australia) investigated the roles of PUMA and NOXA in p53-dependent apoptosis by generating specific knockout mice.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thymocytes from NOXA  to / to  mice died after radiation or exposure to various DNA damaging agents but similar cells from PUMA to / to  mice were resistant.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Fibroblasts from PUMA to / to  mice were also much more resistant to apoptosis compared with NOXA to / to  fibroblasts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	185	 He concluded that neither NOXA nor PUMA were required for normal development, but that PUMA and to a lesser extent, NOXA, were involved in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, although tissue differences were noted.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Interestingly, he also showed that loss of PUMA protected cells from diverse p53-independent cytotoxics, such as staurosporine, glucocortocids, phorbol ester and cytokine withdrawal, suggesting that PUMA is not specific to p53 pathways.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	187	 By crossing PUMA to / to  and +/ to  mice with E micro-myc mice, they found that loss of PUMA accelerated tumour growth, consistent with its role as a tumour suppressor.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	188	Shibue (Tokyo, Japan) also generated NOXA and PUMA knockout mice with similar results to Strasser for isolated thymocytes and embryo fibroblasts.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	211	 They generated mutant/wt, mutant/null and wt/null mice but saw no significant difference in overall survival.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, the tumour spectra were very different.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Mice with mutant p53 had significantly more carcinomas, brain tumours and endothelial tumours (R175H only), whereas mice with both mutant p53 and R175H showed decreased haematological tumours.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Importantly, there were also novel tumours in mutant/null mice.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	215	 They concluded that different p53 mutants do exhibit a clear gain-of-function and different mutants can have different effects that may be tissue specific.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	216	Attardi (Palo Alto, USA) used a similar approach, but rather than using tumour mutants she examined the importance of p53 transactivation function in vivo, by generating knock-in mice with a p53 gene mutated at residues 25 and 26 to abolish transactivation and Mdm-2 binding.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	217	 By looking at various p53 parameters in fibroblasts derived from these mice, she confirmed that the mutant is markedly defective for gene activation under most conditions used, and also defective for cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	219	 For example, the mutation could induce BAX expression after DNA damage, but was completely defective for induction of CDKN1A or NOXA.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Interestingly, she was unable to obtain homozygous mutant mice owing to embryonic lethality.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These data suggest that transcriptionally competent p53 is required for normal embryogenesis, yet paradoxically, mice that are deleted for TP53 generally develop in a normal fashion, although a significant proportion of female TP53 null mice show ex-encephaly.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	224	 As indicated elsewhere in this review, modifications to these residues are thought to be important in dictating the nature of the p53 response to DNA damage.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	232	Bulavin (Singapore) used an approach of replacing the mouse p53 gene with a human p53 (SWAP mice).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	233	 These mice do not develop spontaneous tumours and live twice as long as their p53-null counterparts.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Furthermore, induction of SWAP p53 after ionizing radiation did not induce apoptosis in the thymus and spleen and even more surprisingly, in crosses with E micro-myc mice, SWAP p53 did not prevent rapid onset of tumourigenesis.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Thus, although the approach is novel, as SWAP p53 behaves very differently from expectations, its merits are unclear.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In Rotter's study, primary fibroblasts were transfected with a retrovirus expressing hTERT to induce immortalization, followed by a mutant p53 and/or Ha-Ras to induce a tumourigenic phenotype.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Based on changes in gene expression, she concluded that the initial slow-to-fast growth stage was associated with the loss of INK4A expression and reflects a defect in differentiation; the loss of p53 leads to continued proliferation and genomic instability, and fully transformed cells have characteristics that permit in vivo tumour growth.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were grown until a rare variant (vHMEC) was produced which propagated beyond the Hayflick barrier.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Tlsty showed that these cells have uncoupled the tight controls linking cell division and DNA replication and that this is associated with a loss of p16INK4A expression by hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene promoter.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	247	 When HMEC (normal p16INK4A) and vHMEC (silenced p16INK4A) were further examined, it was noted that the levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 were high in vHMEC, but very low in HMEC.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Biochemical studies indicated that p16INK4A might be regulating p53 stability.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Continuous exposure to TPA then leads to mutation of p53, loss of the remaining p53 allele and finally to amplification of the mutated H-ras gene.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Two mechanisms for TM have been described in gliomas, one requiring the enzyme telomerase and the other a recombinational method designated as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT).

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In this context, it is very clear that p53 binds to motifs within the promoters of a selected group of target genes via its central hydrophobic domain.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	306	 However, there is also a C-terminal non-specific DNA binding domain, whose function remains somewhat controversial.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Furthermore, the question remains as to how p53 recognizes its specific binding motifs within the genome as a whole? Much of this recognition process appears to be dependent on the C-terminus.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	313	 She suggested that non-specific DNA binding facilitates localization of p53 to specific response elements via a sliding mechanism.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	314	 This was tested by looking at the binding of p53 to genomic DNA.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The p53AS form binds genomic DNA much more slowly than wtp53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	316	 So perhaps, p53 having located DNA damage, then slides along the DNA to locate its binding motifs in promoters as a rapid response to stress?.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	319	 She showed that p53 activation domain 2 (amino acid residues 43 to 63) is required for transcription of the pro-apoptotic insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) but the C-terminal basic domain (amino acid residues 364 to 393) is inhibitory.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Activation domain 1 (amino acid residues 1 to 42) controls the inhibitory action of the C-terminus.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Inhibition of apoptosis is thus alleviated by deletion of both of these domains.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	322	 The C-termini of p63 and p73 also inhibit induction of IGFBP3.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	323	Transcriptional regulation by p53 As has been discussed elsewhere in this report, several lines of evidence point to multiple mechanisms by which p53 regulates transcriptional activation: there is functional variation between p53 mutants, cofactor diversity, differences in binding motifs and differences in stress-specific responses.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	324	 In addition, there are differences in promoter architecture between different p53 response genes, e.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	325	 the CDKN1A promoter possesses two p53 binding sequences upstream of TATA/Inr element; the FAS/APO1 promoter has one p53 binding motif downstream of an Inr and PTEN has a p53 binding motif adjacent to a GC-rich sequence.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Focusing on the CDKN1A promoter, prior to UV DNA damage, p53 is bound to its motifs but unphosphorylated at ser15.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Histone acetyl transferase (HAT; bound to p53) and TBP (bound to the TATA-box) are also present, but there is no transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	332	 TAF250 is only recruited to the TBP pre-initiation complex after UV damage and when the promoter is active.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	333	 In contrast, TFIIB and RNA polymerase II are bound before damage, but not present after damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	334	 This RNA polymerase II is the unphosphorylated and active but non-elongating form of the enzyme; elongation activity is activated shortly after UV damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Histone acetylation and TAF250 recruitment occur prior to phosphorylation of ser15 on p53 and the stabilization of p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Therefore, the CDKN1A promoter is poised for action in response to DNA damage.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	337	 However, induction is transient because TFIIB is quickly lost, so RNA polymerase II cannot rebind and transcription is not sustained.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	338	 In contrast, the CDKN1A response to doxorubicin is biphasic.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	339	 After exposure, there is no recruitment of TAF250 to the CDKN1A promoter but there is an increase in TFIIB.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	340	 So after the initial burst of  ready-to-go  transcription and loss of RNA polymerase II, the increase in TFIIB means that TFIIB tends to stay on the promoter, recruit more RNA polymerase II and therefore, another wave of transcription.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	341	Interestingly, the affinity of RNA polymerase II for the CDKN1A promoter is the highest amongst the p53 target genes (along with other genes associated with growth arrest and DNA repair).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	342	 These promoters have plenty of paused RNA polymerase II compared with the apoptotic response genes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Analysis of the FAS/APO1 promoter, which has very low levels of paused bound RNA polymerase II, showed that there is recruitment of TAF250 in response to UV but not doxorubicin, and low levels of bound TFIIB and paused RNA polymerase II remain constant after damage by UV and doxorubicin.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	344	 In this case, there is little pre-initiation complex present before DNA damage but it persists afterwards, and therefore, initiation of transcription by p53 is delayed compared with CDKN1A.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	345	 These results provide the basis for an explanation of how p53 generates rapid cell-cycle arrest responses but more delayed apoptotic responses.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	349	 The majority of investigations are focused on two main areas: one is targeting the Mdm-2/p53 interaction (or equivalent such as the E6/p53 complex; M.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	350	Milner's group, York, UK), and the other aims to alter the conformation of mutant p53 proteins in order to reactivate wt p53 functions.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	351	 From the former perspective, nutlins, appear to be promising candidates.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Nutlins (cis-imidazolines), are small molecules that inhibit the p53/Mdm-2 interaction by mimicking binding of three critical p53 amino acids (leu26, trp23 and ph19) within the p53/Mdm-2-binding domain.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	353	 In an impressive presentation, L.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	354	Vassiliev (New Jersey, USA) showed that in cells with wt p53 but not mutant p53, nutlins cause a dose-dependent elevation of p53 protein and p53 transcriptional activity.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	355	 The global effect of nutlin on p53 gene activation was verified by gene array profiling.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Nutlins also efficiently inhibit clonogenic growth and induce apoptosis in cells with wt p53, in a dose-dependent fashion.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	357	 The beauty of nutlins is that they do not need DNA damaging agents to activate p53 (see Signalling section).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	358	 In xenograft models, nutlins have proved more effective than paclitaxel and at higher doses can completely abrogate tumour growth, with no obvious pathology.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	359	 These agents appear to show great promise as new cancer therapeutics.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	360	Several studies have attempted large-scale screening of small molecules that might reactivate mutant p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	361	Fersht's group, Cambridge, UK) provided preliminary data of an NMR approach that could be used to evaluate the effects of small molecule effects on p53 structure, thus allowing the rationale design of molecules.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	362	 They are now using NMR as a sensitive tool for screening novel molecules that bind weakly to p53 and might then be refined.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	363	 The advantage of this system is that only compounds that bind and alter p53 structure are detected and the approach can be automated for high throughput screening.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	364	Wiman (Stockholm, Sweden) reported on efforts to identify small molecules that might be used to reactivate normal p53 function in mutants.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Using a high-throughput screen of small molecules able to induce growth arrest or apoptosis in cells stably expressing mutant R273H, they originally identified PRIMA-1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	366	 PRIMA-1 inhibits tumourigenesis of human xenografts and may prove useful in sensitizing cells to killing by current anticancer drugs.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Biochemical studies suggest that this sensitization may result from increased levels of mutant p53 induced by low levels of drug (e.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	368	 cisplatin), which increases the available pool of p53 for reactivation by PRIMA-1.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	369	 With this in mind, he proposed that any agent capable of elevating mutant p53 levels might synergize with PRIMA-1 to kill cells.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Using a similar approach, this group has also identified another small compound, MIRA-1, that can also reactivate mutant p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	371	Drummond (Auckland, NZ) described a compound called SN28049 that upregulates the death receptors Fas and DR5, and is preferentially cytotoxic in tumour cells with wt p53 activity.

0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	375	Levine (New Jersey), was asked to speculate on what the next chapter of p53 research might be.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Commenting on areas that were under-represented at the meeting, he thought that in the next period up to the 13th International p53 Workshop in New York in 2006, we would learn a lot more about the  gain-of-function  of tumour associated p53 mutant proteins, about transcriptional repression by p53 and about the role of p53 in cellular senescence.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	377	 For example, which mutants have gain-of-function? Do they all behave in the same way? Does transcriptional repression have biological meaning? How does p53 induce senescence? The increased use of transgenic knock-in mutant mice will help answer many questions about  gain-of-function  mutants as well as yeast based genetic screens.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	378	However, beyond its role in tumour suppression, and having regard for the many complex signalling pathways with which p53 appears to be involved in (Figure 1), Levine proposed that p53 may be a  ubiquitous sensor  of stress and as such is involved in the prevention of other, possibly aging-related disorders.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	379	 These, he suggested, may include diabetes, arthritis, atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases, for which there is indeed some evidence already (2 to 4), and even psychological stresses.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Thus, rather than just acting to prevent genetic lesions accumulating in somatic tissues which can lead to cancer, p53 may act to dampen many physiological stresses that may, if unchecked, lead to disorders.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Such responses may often be beneficial in the short-term, but long-term dysregulation can cause damage to body organs, resulting in premature ageing.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	382	 This cumulative wear and tear is known as allostatic load (5).
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	383	 The idea that p53 may be important in the control of allostatic load is very exciting as it may well account for the large diversity of signals that appear to  activate  p53.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	384	 A handle on this might be obtained by analysing patients for polymorphisms in TP53 and in other members of the p53 pathway, such as the SNP309 discussed above, and correlating them with various ageing-related phenotypes.
0.7534733.15817608.html.plaintext.txt	385	 It will be interesting to see if anyone picks up this gauntlet and has data by the time of the next meeting, potentially opening up even more areas of investigation, for the next generation of p53 researchers.

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	2	    INTRODUCTION Top Introduction References.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	3	Loss of control of genomic stability is central in the development of cancer, and p53, by regulating normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress, is a key element in maintaining genomic stability.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Thus, it is no surprise that functional p53 is lost in about half of all human cancers.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	5	 What about the other half? One possibility is that p53-independent regulatory mechanisms have been lost.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Another is that inactivation of p53-dependent pathways can occur at any of several different points and that p53 itself is merely the most common target.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	7	 For example, the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 is overexpressed in tumors independently of the p53 mutation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here, we review pathways that signal in to p53, in response to different forms of stress, and pathways that signal out, triggered by activated p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is clear that p53 is the central component of a complex network of signaling pathways and that the other components of these pathways pose alternative targets for inactivation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For additional recent reviews, see Refs.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	11	The amount of p53 protein increases in response to a variety of signals, such as damaged DNA, arrest of DNA or RNA synthesis, or nucleotide depletion.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The same stimuli also activate p53, which is mostly latent in the absence of stress.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The increase in the amount of protein is often achieved through an increase in the half-life, from ~30 min in untreated cells to ~150 min in, for example, UV-treated cells (3).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, an increase in the rate of translational initiation of p53 mRNA can also affect the steady-state level of the protein (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The ubiquitin pathway probably plays an important role in degrading p53 (5), and evidence for a ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation has also been presented (6).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	16	Recent evidence has also shown that the Mdm2 protein, which binds to p53, accelerates its degradation, possibly through the ubiquitin pathway (7, 8).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The fact that the mdm2 gene is a transcriptional target of p53 suggests a molecular basis for the commonly observed increased metabolic half-life of mutant p53 proteins defective in transactivation.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, the stability of these mutant proteins appears to be due to their inability to up-regulate the expression of Mdm2, a protein involved in their degradation, rather than an intrinsic property conferring resistance to degradation per se.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	19	An increase in transactivation due to p53, with no increase in the level of the protein, was found in cells treated with low doses of UV radiation, and microinjection of an antibody to the C-terminal domain also stimulated p53-dependent transcription, even in the absence of DNA damage (9).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Chernov and Stark (10) found that sodium salicylate, which inhibits protein kinases inhibits the activation of p53, with no significant effect on the accumulation of the protein.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Several processes might be involved in activating p53 (1), including phosphorylation, glycosylation, binding to regulatory proteins, alternative splicing, and acetylation (11).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	22	How does p53 sense signals? Several known proteins are suspects.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK),1 a plausible candidate, binds to and is activated by broken ends of DNA (12) and can phosphorylate residues 15 and 37 of p53 in a DNA-dependent manner in vitro (13).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The phosphorylation of serine 15 affects the transactivation and growth arrest functions of p53 in some cells (14).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, cells lacking DNAPK show no defect in the p53-mediated inhibition of the cell cycle, revealing that if DNAPK has any role in regulating p53 at all, other components must be able to compensate for its loss (15).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	26	Many protein kinases have been shown to phosphorylate p53 in vitro and are candidates for upstream regulators (1).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, very little in vivo evidence exists for the role of phosphorylation in regulating p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Recent work showing that p53 can be acetylated in vitro is intriguing and suggests the possibility of an additional mechanism of regulation (11).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, it is still necessary to show that acetylation occurs in response to stress.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	30	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has long been known to have a role in recognizing DNA damage and in DNA repair.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	31	 PARP-null Chinese hamster cells are defective in activating p53 and resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage (16).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, embryo fibroblasts from PARP-null mice have normal DNA repair and DNA damage-induced apoptosis (17), and although there is a significant decrease in the induction of p53 protein after DNA damage or nucleotide depletion, there is no change in p53 activity or in the cellular responses to stress (18).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Therefore, although PARP is involved in increasing the amount of p53 protein in mouse fibroblasts, other signaling pathways must be more important in activating p53 in response to DNA damage, consistent with experiments showing at least two levels of 53 regulation (9, 10).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Loss of ATM, the product of the ataxia telangiectasia gene, slows the induction of p53 protein in response to the DNA strand breaks caused by -radiation but not in response to the pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation (19, 20).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Similarly, p53 is induced normally in human ATM-null cells after treatment with N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), which blocks de novo UMP biosynthesis, or adriamycin, which damages DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	36	2 p53 and ATM may both be components of complexes that function in recombination (21).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Similarly, the gene product involved in Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) has also been placed upstream of p53 in the pathway that responds to ionizing radiation but not in the responses to other DNA-damaging agents (22).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because the defects in p53 induction in ATM-null, NBS-null, and PARP-null cells are partial or selective for certain kinds of DNA damage, these gene products are involved in some but not all of the signals.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Double or triple knock-outs should have a more profound (perhaps even a complete) defect in p53 induction in response to DNA damage.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Similar partial defects in p53 signaling have been observed in Fanconi anemia syndrome (FAS) and Bloom's syndrome (BLS) fibroblasts, suggesting that many pathways regulate p53 (20, 23).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	41	Recently a role for oncogenic Ras and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in p53 modulation and function has been revealed in both human and rodent cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	42	 High expression of Ras or activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway induces wild-type p53 levels and causes a permanent growth arrest, similar to cellular senescence (24, 25).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Cells lacking p53 can tolerate high levels of MAPK and display loss of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and enhanced genomic instability (24).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In a cell line defective in the MAP kinase pathway and in p53 expression, increased expression of the MAP kinase ERK2 restores the normal levels of p53, clearly placing ERK2 in a pathway that regulates the steady-state level of p53.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	45	3 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate residue 73 or 83 of murine p53 in vitro, and this phosphorylation may be important in stabilizing the protein (26).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Other kinases, such as DNAPK II, cyclin A-Cdc2, and cyclin B-Cdc2, are known to phosphorylate the p53 protein in vitro and may play a role in stabilizing it (14, 27).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The mechanisms of p53 induction in response to different types of stress are still largely unknown.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	48	p53 is involved in several different aspects of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, control of genome integrity, and DNA repair (1, 2).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	49	 How does it regulate so many different processes? p53 is a tetramer that can bind to specific sequences and thus transactivate a group of genes (reviewed in Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	50	 1; for example, p21/waf1, gadd45, mdm2, cyclin G, bax, and IGF-BP3).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Several groups have found that active p53 is sensed differently at different promoters, resulting in differential DNA binding and transactivation (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	52	 p53 can also inhibit the expression of some genes (for example, see topoisomerase IIa (29)).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Furthermore, some p53-dependent phenotypes do not involve transcriptional regulation at all (for example, see Ref.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	54	The G1-S Transition-- Antibodies recognizing the C terminus of p53 prevent serum-stimulated fibroblasts from entering S phase (31).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This result, originally interpreted as evidence that a positive function of p53 was required, posed a paradox when overexpression of wild-type p53 was found to cause growth arrest (32).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The paradox was resolved when it was found that these antibodies activate rather than inhibit p53 (9).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	57	 It is now understood more clearly that p53 mediates G1 arrest in response to DNA damage caused by UV or -radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, or nucleotide deprivation (33-35).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The cell-type variability in p53-dependent G1 arrest is illustrated by studies with -radiation, which in normal diploid fibroblasts causes long-term, p53-dependent arrest associated with prolonged induction of p21/Waf1 (36).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The irreversibility of this arrest depends on the inability of these cells to repair even a small number of double-strand DNA breaks, so that the activating signal persists (37).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In contrast, -irradiation of HT1080 cells, derived from a fibrosarcoma with wild-type p53, causes a transient G1 arrest (38), whereas the colorectal tumor line RKO and the breast tumor line MCF7, which also have wild-type p53, fail to arrest in G1 following irradiation (39).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	61	 These differences may indicate that tumor formation may involve the inactivation of components upstream or downstream of p53, causing the cellular response to DNA damage to fail.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	62	 For example, -irradiation activates p53 to turn on the transcription of p21/Waf1, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb, thus preventing the release of E2F and blocking the G1-S transition (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Alteration of any of these downstream components may have an effect similar to that of inactivating p53 itself in preventing the pathway from functioning.

0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	66	 p53 accumulates and is modified and activated in response to signals generated by a variety of genotoxic stresses.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Several proteins, including ATM, PARP, FAS, BLS, and NBS (see the text for full names), are involved in activation, but the pathways that lead to modification are largely unknown.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The RAS-MAP kinase pathway is involved in establishing basal levels of p53 and may also affect function.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Some of the cellular functions affected by p53 can be compromised by deregulated expression of Myc, Bcl2, E1B, or E2F.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The control of p53 activity includes an autoregulatory loop involving Mdm2.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The intact set of p53-dependent pathways helps to maintain genomic integrity by eliminating damaged cells, either by arresting them permanently or through apoptosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	72	 p53 also helps to regulate entry into mitosis, spindle formation, and centrosome integrity, cell cycle checkpoints that are likely to be involved in preventing DNA damage from occurring.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	73	The Spindle Checkpoint-- p53 is involved in a checkpoint that blocks the re-replication of DNA when the mitotic spindle has been damaged.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	74	 When the DNA content of embryo fibroblasts was measured after treatment with nocodazole or other inhibitors of microtubule assembly, it was found that normal fibroblasts arrest with a 4 N content of DNA, whereas p53-null fibroblasts attain DNA contents of 8 or 16 N (40).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Spindle destruction might block progression through mitosis, or re-replication might be controlled by blocking entry into S phase.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In a murine cell line with wild-type p53, nocodazole causes transient mitotic arrest, followed by entry into G1 without chromosome segregation (41).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	77	 p53 is induced after mitosis is complete.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The conclusion that the p53 induced in response to spindle damage blocks entry into S phase was also reached by analyzing DNA synthesis in fibroblasts exposed to nocodazole or colcemid (42).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Interestingly, fibroblasts from p21/Waf1-null mice do not re-replicate their DNA when treated with spindle poisons, consistent with the observation that G1 arrest in response to a number of agents is only partially abrogated in these cells (43).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Therefore, p53 must also utilize p21-independent mechanisms to arrest cells in G1 and thus to inhibit re-replication in response to spindle poisons.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	81	Centrosome Homeostasis-- Embryo fibroblasts from p53-null mice acquire more than two centrosomes, leading to mitosis with more than two spindle poles and frequent mitotic failure (44).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	82	 p53 is associated with centrosomes and thus may affect centrosome duplication directly (45).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Alternatively, improper duplication of centrosomes may signal p53 activation, which could in turn cause arrest in G2 or G1.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	84	 It is intriguing that MAP kinase and Cdc2, both capable of phosphorylating p53, are also bound to centrosomes (1, 26, 46, 47) and, like p53, MAP kinase is important for centrosome homeostasis (46).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	85	The G2-M Transition-- In both human and mouse fibroblasts, overexpression of wild-type p53 can inhibit entry into mitosis (48, 49).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Recent results show that this property of p53 is important in a novel cell cycle checkpoint that controls entry into mitosis when DNA synthesis is blocked.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	87	4 In hydroxyurea-treated cells in which synthesis of dNTPs is blocked very rapidly, p53 plays a vital role in inhibiting premature entry into mitosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts do not attempt mitosis in hydroxyurea.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In contrast, p53-null mouse embryo fibroblasts continue to attempt mitosis, entering metaphase with condensed chromatin and high levels of phosphorylated histone H1.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	90	 However, cytokinesis cannot occur and mitosis is aborted, presumably because the spindles cannot segregate incompletely replicated DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Presumably, these responses are present to prevent the segregation of damaged or incompletely synthesized DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	92	p53 plays a role in triggering apoptosis in certain cell types, e.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Stimuli such as DNA damage, withdrawal of growth factors, and expression of Myc or E1A can also cause p53-dependent apoptosis (50-54).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	94	 p53 must be able to function as a transcription factor to block the G1-S transition, but p53-mediated apoptosis does not necessarily require transcriptional activation, because inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or translation by cycloheximide does not always affect p53-dependent apoptosis (30, 54).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Furthermore, inhibitors of protein phosphatases induce p53-dependent apoptosis in the absence of transactivation (55).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	96	 However, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Igf-Bp3 are transcriptional targets of p53, suggesting that transactivation by p53 is important in inducing apoptosis in some circumstances.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In addition, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and the adenovirus 19-kDa E1B protein can prevent p53-mediated apoptosis (53, 56).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	98	p53 induces apoptosis in some cell types but cell cycle arrest in others, in response to the same stimulus.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Although the mechanisms of such divergent responses are not known, deletion of p21/Waf1 can cause cells that would otherwise undergo p53-dependent cell cycle arrest to undergo apoptosis instead, underscoring the major role of genetic background in determining these cellular responses (57).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Several variables, such as the extent of DNA damage and the levels of p53, also affect the choice between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (58).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Also, cross-talk between the p53 and Rb pathways may be important in determining the biological responses to DNA damage.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	102	 For example, the inactivation of Rb results in the loss of G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis after DNA damage (59).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This might be explained by the release of E2F (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	104	 1), which when overexpressed on its own can induce apoptosis (60).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Furthermore, overexpression of Rb blocks p53-mediated apoptosis (61).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Thus, modulation of Rb and E2F through p53 signaling in response to DNA damage may play a central role in determining the balance between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	107	p53-dependent cell cycle control maintains genetic integrity in populations of cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Gene amplification is a widely used model to study genetic integrity.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In most transformed or immortalized cells, drugs such as PALA or methotrexate, which inhibit the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, select for the amplification of target genes whose products overcome the inhibition, carbamyl-P synthetase/aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydro-orotase (CAD) in the case of PALA and dihydrofolate reductase for methotrexate (62).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, normal cells (63) and rare cell lines, such as REF52 (64), do not give rise to resistant colonies in these drugs.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The function of p53 is lost frequently during the process of tumorigenesis (65) and in the spontaneous immortalization of primary cells (66), indicating that p53 can be the main factor determining permissivity for gene amplification.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Indeed, embryo fibroblasts from p53-null mice are permissive for gene amplification (67), and primary human cells from Li-Fraumeni patients became permissive as soon as they lost their single copy of wild-type p53 (67, 68).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Transformation of REF52 cells with either SV40 large T antigen or activated Ras plus E1A abolishes p53-dependent cell cycle control and allows these cells to become permissive for gene amplification (64).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	114	 What signal is generated as a part of the mechanism of gene amplification that could activate p53-dependent pathways and prevent the propagation of drug-resistant cells? The current model of amplification involves, as an essential early step, multiple bridge-breakage-fusion cycles in which broken DNA is formed throughout an entire lineage of daughter cells (69, 70).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The importance of DNA damage in regulating early stages of gene amplification was demonstrated with REF52 cells transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen (71).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	116	 When these cells are selected with PALA at low temperature, active large T antigen inactivates p53, rendering the cells permissive for gene amplification.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Restoration of p53 by inactivating large T antigen at a higher temperature very early in the process of forming PALA-resistant colonies stably arrests all cells containing newly amplified DNA.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	118	Human cell lines can achieve resistance to PALA by mechanisms other than gene amplification in situ, which is by far the most common mechanism in rodent cells.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Most PALA-resistant colonies, from several different human cell lines, either do not contain amplified CAD DNA at all or increase the copy number of CAD as isochromosomes 2p (72).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, in both cases, p53-dependent pathways are still involved.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides caused by PALA generates a signal for p53 induction before any DNA damage occurs (35), arresting the cells and preventing PALA-resistant colonies from forming.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Recent work has shown that overexpressing endogenous or exogenous N-Myc allows REF52 cells to overcome the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest caused by DNA damage, making these cells permissive for gene amplification (73).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This observation emphasizes the fact that p53-dependent pathways can be inhibited at any of several different points (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	124	p53 signaling pathways connect with tumor suppressors and oncogenes known to influence the cell cycle machinery (Fig.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Alterations in components either upstream or downstream of p53 may be analogous to inactivation of p53 itself, preventing all or a part of the entire pathway from functioning and leading to deregulation of cell cycle controls, genomic instability, and the development of cancer.
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In addition, the recently discovered protein p73, which has a high degree of structural and functional homology to p53, may be another important target for inactivation during the development of cancer (74).
0.5579345.9417035.html.plaintext.txt	127	 It remains to be determined if p73 affects signals impinging on or emanating from p53 or if it is a central component of its own independent signaling network.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	3	 We report on the high dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Down-regulation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTMP) by inhibitors of electron transport (rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA)) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (oligomycin) prevented stress-induced p53 protein accumulation and abrogated p53-dependent apoptosis in a wild-type p53 leukemia cell line MOLT-3, in primary leukemia cells and in normal T lymphocytes.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, stress-induced up-regulation of the p53 transcriptional targets and their specific inhibition by oligomycin has been demonstrated.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Oligomycin did not impair p53-independent apoptosis and caused only a slight reduction of intracellular ATP levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) localized to mitochondria decreased in the presence of oligomycin, and stress-induced p53 activation showed strong ROS sensitivity both in leukemic and normal cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These observations identify mitochondrial activity, described by MTMP and ROS levels, as a critical intracellular determinant of the p53 stress sensitivity and suggest potential implications of this linkage in the mechanisms of chemoresistance of acute leukemia cells.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Cellular stress response often implicates activation of the proapoptotic p53-dependent machinery, which determines the threshold level of cellular stress able to trigger apoptosis.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	11	1,2 p53 is regulated mainly at the posttranscriptional level and its protein level in the absence of stress is consistently low due to a high rate of p53 protein degradation via the proteasome pathway.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Stress-induced signaling results in modification of the p53 protein either by phosphorylation or acetylation and in the resistance of p53 to proteasome degradation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	13	3,4 A further basic regulatory mechanism of the p53 system is the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator Mdm2 protein, which acts as a p53-specific E3 ligase and is, in turn, transcriptionally regulated by p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	14	5 The importance of p53/Mdm2 interactions is underscored by the variety of mechanisms used by a cell to disrupt these interactions in response to stress, including posttranslational modifications, subcellular redistribution, inhibition of Mdm2 activity, and its transcription.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	15	5 More recently, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH) quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) was demonstrated to regulate p53 stability.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	16	6 NQO1 was suggested to interact physically with p53 and to stabilize p53 through Mdm2-independent mechanisms.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	20	10 The list of targets includes genes encoding for proteins critically involved in cell-cycle regulation (p21, GADD45A), apoptosis (Bax, PUMA, CD95, TRAIL), and the intracellular redox state (PIG3, PIG12).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	21	The mitochondrion plays a dual role in the cell as a regulator of apoptosis and as a cellular powerhouse, and multiple mitochondrial components are involved both in the regulatory processes of energy metabolism and in stress-induced apoptosis signaling.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	22	13,14 The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial energy transformation involves the electron transport chain, which consists of electron transfer complexes I-IV embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The electron transport chain serves to convert the high energy potential of electrons from NADH and FADH2 molecules into the energy of the proton gradient across the inner membrane, defined as the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, MTMP (DeltaPsiM; m).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The MTMP level is proportional to the number of protons pumped to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane during electron transport and reflects the mitochondrial activity of the cell.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	25	 It is the free energy of the proton gradient that finally drives the synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate, occurring at the site of ATP synthase (complex V, F0/F1-ATPase).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	26	14 Mitochondrial activity critically contributes to the intracellular redox state as the major source of reactive oxygen species, ROS, which are generated as a result of occasional escape of electrons from the electron transport chain.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	27	In p53-dependent proapoptotic signaling, the key events leading to activation of caspases and apoptotic cell death are the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of apoptogenic factors, especially of mitochondrial cytochrome c.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	28	17,18 Mitochondrial permeabilization is preceded by a complex decision phase, which involves integration of pro- and antiapoptotic signals and converges on the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	29	18,19 Several genes encoding for proapoptotic Bcl-2 related proteins, including Bax and PUMA, are direct transcriptional targets of p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	30	20,21 It has recently been proposed that there is direct cooperation between Bax and mitochondrial ATP synthase during the process of mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	31	22 Mitochondria are further involved critically at the later stages of apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction defines the irreversible stage of apoptosis, characterized by MTMP loss, redox shift, and increase of intracellular ROS levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	32	Mitochondrial involvement in proapoptotic p53 signaling has been largely investigated downstream of p53 activation in cellular systems overexpressing either wild-type (wt) or temperature-sensitive mutant p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	33	17,22 Here we address the contribution of mitochondrial components to the early stress signaling upstream of p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To this end, we have investigated cellular systems with endogenously expressed wt p53, including normal T lymphocytes and a wt p53 leukemia MOLT-3 cell line.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	35	24-26 We also focused on primary cells from patients with acute leukemia at diagnosis, in which p53 mutations are infrequent.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	36	27-29 The results demonstrate that there is a strong dependence of stress-induced p53 activation on mitochondrial activity, which suggests that mitochondrial status is implicated in the mechanisms of chemoresistance in acute leukemia cells.

0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	231	In addition to the MOLT-3 system, we also observed NAC inhibition of the etoposide-induced p53 accumulation in activated T cells (Figure 6C).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Moreover, there was also a clear inhibitory effect of NAC on p53 accumulation in primary ALL cells (Figure 6D).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	233	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   In the present study we addressed the contribution of mitochondrial components involved in oxidative phosphorylation to proapoptotic stress signaling in cell systems endogenously expressing wt p53, and identified a link between mitochondrial activity and the stress responsiveness of the p53 system in leukemia cells and in normal lymphocytes.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	234	 As a result of this linkage, down-regulation or constitutively low MTMP levels conferred chemoresistance to cells at the p53 level.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	235	Of various mitochondrial inhibitors able to down-regulate MTMP, oligomycin revealed the highest efficacy to prevent stress-induced p53 accumulation and p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Oligomycin was recently reported to inhibit apoptosis in cellular systems with transiently activated p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	237	22 ATP synthase has been shown to cooperate with the p53 target Bax, thus indicating a contribution of mitochondrial components of oxidative phosphorylation to proapoptotic signaling downstream of p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Our investigations of cellular systems with endogenous wt p53 suggest a contribution of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to the proapoptotic signaling upstream of p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Moreover, the observation that apoptotic signaling via p53-independent pathways, either mitochondrial (staurosporine) or extrinsic (CD95 death receptor), was not affected by mitochondrial inhibitors, indicates a selective linkage of mitochondrial activity to p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This is further supported by genome-wide gene expression analysis of MOLT-3 cells, which has demonstrated a largely selective inhibition by oligomycin of p53-specific targets but not other stress-inducible (including NFB-dependent) transcriptional targets.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	241	At the concentrations able to effectively abrogate drug-induced p53 signaling and apoptosis, oligomycin caused a low to moderate reduction of intracellular ATP levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In line with this, oligomycin did not impair the ATP-dependent cascade of (p53-independent) apoptotic events53,54 and did not cause a switch to necrotic cell death.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	243	54 It is of particular importance, that the moderate ATP decrease by inhibition of glycolysis did not inhibit stress-induced p53 accumulation and apoptosis.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	244	 These data suggest that reduction of intracellular ATP levels is unlikely to be the mechanism of suppression of drug-induced p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	245	ROS have been implicated as second messengers in multiple signaling pathways.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	246	55,56 Mitochondrion is the main site of ROS generation, which results from the escape of transported electrons from the electron transport chain.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	247	15,16 Reduction of mitochondrial ROS by overexpression of mitochondrial redox-regulating thioredoxin has been reported to confer cellular resistance to etoposide.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	248	57 The general antioxidant NAC has been reported to prevent p53 accumulation, induced by drugs generating ROS, and to prevent cell death downstream of p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	249	58-62 Redox dependence of the stress-induced signaling in our cell systems has been demonstrated by investigations of ROS levels and the effects of NAC.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Our data demonstrated that ROS are involved in stress-induced signaling upstream of p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	251	 A striking similarity was observed in all cellular systems studied between the effects of oligomycin and NAC on the etoposide-induced p53 accumulation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Furthermore, oligomycin was found to down-regulate mitochondrial ROS, while NAC did not affect MTMP levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These data suggest that mitochondrial ROS may be implicated as second messengers between mitochondrial electron transport activity and stress-induced p53 activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	254	Redox-regulating oxidoreductases have recently emerged as a novel class of interaction partners of the p53 protein, indicating the importance of intracellular redox-regulating factors in the stress-induced p53-activation.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Chang et al63 identified WOX1 oxidoreductase as a proapoptotic protein, which became phosphorylated in response to stress or apoptotic stimuli and formed a complex with activated p53.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	256	 The p53 complex with a wild-type, but not mutant WOX1, translocated to the mitochondria and further to the nuclei to mediate apoptosis.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In a series of studies Asher et al6,64,65 demonstrated that NQO1 oxidoreductase regulates p53 in a MDM2-independent manner.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In addition, Anwar et al7 demonstrated that p53 stabilization requires the physical interaction of p53 with NQO1.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	259	 It was also shown that heat-shock protein HSP70B interacts with an immature form of NQO1 and is responsible for the stability and functionality of this oxidoreductase.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	260	47 We observed down-regulation of the HSP70B encoding gene and of the gene encoding for a component of the mitochondrial complex I with a NADH dehydrogenase activity, NDUFC1.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	261	 These changes, which indicate interference of oligomycin with cellular redox regulation at the transcriptional level, are of particular interest, as only a small number of genes were consistently down-regulated by oligomycin (Table 1).
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	262	 It remains to be elucidated, whether oxidoreductase-specific p53 regulation may be operative in the ROS-mediated linkage between mitochondrial activity and the p53 system.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	263	Quantification of intracellular MTMP levels provides a useful intrinsic determinant describing mitochondrial activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Heerdt et al66,67 have reported the dependence of intrinsic MTMP levels on the extent of growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Harper et al68 have found that decreased MTMP levels are characteristic of drug-resistant leukemia cell lines as compared to MTMP levels in their drug-sensitive counterparts.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	266	 It is of particular interest that chemoresistant cells have been found to switch their energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic energy sources, thus preserving energy supply while reducing mitochondrial activity.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	267	68 Our data suggest that this cellular metabolic strategy would decrease or abolish cellular stress sensitivity at the p53 level, thus providing a clinically-relevant mechanism of chemoresistance of the wt p53 cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It would be of interest to investigate whether differential MTMP levels observed in the primary ALL cells might be due to metabolic differences in these cells.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	269	Recent studies have indicated the impact of wt p53 on mitochondrial function.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Mouse embryos homozygous for a p53 null mutation showed mitochondrial deficiency at a stage in development when the embryo switches from an anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	271	69 In wt p53 cells, constitutive and stress-dependent colocalization of p53 with mitochondria have been reported.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	272	70,71 Mitochondrial targeting of the dominant-negative p53 mutant protein resulted in decreased MTMP levels.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	273	72 Our data provide experimental evidence that activation of the p53 system requires mitochondrial activity, and point to mitochondrial ROS as secondary messengers between respiratory chain and proapoptotic p53 machinery.
0.5554981.15705792.html.plaintext.txt	274	 This linkage has potential clinical implications in the mechanisms of chemoresistance in normal and malignant cells.

0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	6	The pituitary tumor transforming gene, PTTG, is abundantly expressed in several neoplasms.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We recently showed that PTTG overexpression is associated with apoptosis and therefore have now studied the role of p53 in this process.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express wild type p53, PTTG overexpression caused apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	9	 p53 was translocated to the nuclei in cells expressing PTTG.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Overexpression of p53, along with PTTG, augmented apoptosis, whereas expression of the human papillomavirus E6 protein inhibited PTTG-induced apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In MG-63 osteosarcoma cells that are deficient in p53, PTTG caused cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis that was inhibited by caspase inhibitors.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A proteasome inhibitor augmented PTTG expression in stable PTTG transfectants, suggesting that down-regulated PTTG expression is required for cell survival.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, MG-63 cells expressing PTTG showed signs of aneuploidy including the presence of micronuclei and multiple nuclei.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results indicate that PTTG overexpression causes p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis.

0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	154	In this study, we have elucidated mechanisms for PTTG-induced apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Although all results shown were derived from the comparison of PTTG-EGFP and EGFP, PTTG-EGFP appears to faithfully represent PTTG, because they exhibit similar cellular characteristics (9) and caused similar cell death (data not shown).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Several lines of evidence from our study indicate that p53 mediates PTTG-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	157	 PTTG up-regulated and translocated p53 to the nucleus, overexpression of p53 augmented PTTG-induced apoptosis, and the HPV E6 protein, a p53 inactivator, prevented PTTG-induced apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	158	 It is not clear, however, how p53 is activated by PTTG.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	159	 myc and ras activate p53 by activating ARF, a tumor suppressor protein (12, 21) that in turn causes nuclear accumulation of mdm2, preventing p53 nuclear export and subsequent degradation (22, 23).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We did not observe a simultaneous nuclear accumulation of p53 and mdm2, suggesting that the ARF mechanism may not apply to PTTG-induced apoptosis, yet PTTG may induce p53 nuclear accumulation by inhibiting mdm2 expression through other mechanisms (23).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The dominant negative p53 mutant did not inhibit PTTG-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, possibly indicating that the mutant p53 may not completely inhibit endogenous p53 activity as effectively as the HPV E6 protein.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	162	 It is also likely that mechanisms other than p53 are also involved in PTTG-induced apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	163	PTTG caused apoptosis in p53-negative MG-63 cells, demonstrating that PTTG-induced apoptosis can be p53-independent.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It appeared that PTTG causes cell cycle arrest prior to apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This was evident inasmuch as cells expressing PTTG did not divide after release from double thymidine block, and cycling PTTG-expressing cells were also partially blocked at G2/M.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The PTTG effect on the cell cycle may therefore be both direct and indirect.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The securin function of PTTG (8, 9) would predict that exit from mitosis is inhibited in cells overexpressing PTTG, and overexpression of a nondegradable PTTG disrupts sister chromatid separation (8).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The direct impact of PTTG overexpression on mitosis does not explain why only a small percentage of cells were blocked at G2/M after one to two doubling times, therefore suggesting an additional indirect mechanism, i.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	169	 that PTTG activates a surveillance mechanism other than p53, which in turn causes cell cycle arrest.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The nature of this surveillance is not clear, but the checkpoint kinases chk1 and chk2 are possible candidates, because they have been involved in p53-independent apoptosis induced by DNA damage (24, 25).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Apoptosis may thus result from PTTG-induced cell cycle arrest.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	172	We show evidence that PTTG causes aneuploidy in MG-63 cells.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Transient and stable PTTG expression is associated with a higher frequency of aneuploidy.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	174	 PTTG degradation is required to start the anaphase (8, 9).
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	175	 When a cell overexpresses PTTG, sister chromatids may not separate completely, resulting in a cell with one or more extra chromosomes manifesting as micronuclei.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Sister chromatids may not separate at all, forming cells with multiple nuclei or macronuclei.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It appears that p53 plays a role in preventing PTTG-induced aneuploidy, because aneuploidy was evident in p53-deficient MG-63 cells and in MCF-7 and JEG-3 cells after endogenous p53 was inhibited.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Similar observations have been made on the myc (26) and ras (27) oncogenes that induce chromosome instability only after p53 is inactivated.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	179	The dual effects of PTTG on apoptosis and aneuploidy are distinct but closely related in tumorigenesis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Apoptosis does not occur as a result of aneuploidy, because the majority of cells were not aneuploid before they entered apoptosis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Rather, by clearing cells that can become aneuploid, apoptosis appears to be a means of protecting against aneuploidy and the resultant tumorigenesis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The dual effects of PTTG on apoptosis and aneuploidy suggest a mechanism for PTTG-induced tumorigenesis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	183	 PTTG overexpression activates p53 and a p53-independent apoptosis pathway.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Where both apoptotic systems fail, PTTG-induced aneuploid cells survive and divide, prompting daughter cells to be tumorous.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This model implies that PTTG-induced tumorigenesis is a slow process, and tumors do not form until apoptosis surveillance systems fail.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	186	 On the other hand, if PTTG expression is down-regulated by the ubiquitin pathway as we show in this paper, the resultant slightly increased PTTG expression may still escape surveillance and cause aneuploidy.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thus PTTG potentially can contribute to tumorigenesis even when the apoptosis surveillance systems are intact.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Because aneuploidy is assumed to be less severe when PTTG is down-regulated, tumorigenesis should also be slow.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	189	In summary, we show that PTTG induced both apoptosis and aneuploidy, and the results suggest that apoptosis may play an important role in preventing tumorigenesis.
0.49688247.11013229.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We have now established mice deficient in PTTG2 and will more directly address the mechanism of PTTG-induced tumorigenesis in these animals.

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	4	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive genomic instability syndrome characterized by developmental defects, progressive bone marrow failure, and cancer.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	5	 FA is genetically heterogeneous, however; the proteins encoded by different FA loci interact functionally with each other and with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM gene products.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Although patients with FA are highly predisposed to the development of myeloid leukemia and solid tumors, the alterations in biochemical pathways responsible for the progression of tumorigenesis in these patients remain unknown.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	7	 FA cells are hypersensitive to a range of genotoxic and cellular stresses that activate signaling pathways mediating apoptosis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here we show that ionizing radiation (IR) induces modestly elevated levels of p53 in cells from FA type C (Fancc) mutant mice and that inactivation of Trp53 rescues tumor necrosis factor -induced apoptosis in myeloid cells from Fancc-/- mice.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Further, whereas Fancc-/- mice failed to form hematopoietic or solid malignancies, mice mutant at both Fancc and Trp53 developed tumors more rapidly than mice mutant at Trp53 alone.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This shortened latency was associated with the appearance of tumor types that are found in patients with FA but not in mice mutant at Trp53 only.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Collectively, these data demonstrate that p53 and Fancc interact functionally to regulate apoptosis and tumorigenesis in Fancc-deficient cells.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	12	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a progressive bone marrow failure, developmental defects, and cancer.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Individuals with FA have a 500- to 1000-fold increased risk of developing myeloid leukemia and a range of solid tumors that preferentially affect the head and neck, skin, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	14	1-4 Recent studies have identified the existence of 7 FA gene products (denoted FANCA-FANCG) that appear to function, at least in part, in a complex of signaling proteins that modulate genomic stability (for a review, see Joenje and Patel5).
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition, one gene product (FANCC) appears to have a role in modulating apoptosis in addition to its role in the FANCA-FANCG complex.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	16	6-8 The ways the different FA proteins interact with each other and with other biochemical pathways to maintain genomic stability and prevent tumor formation is an area of active investigation.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	17	Although the mechanisms underlying tumor formation in patients with FA are incompletely understood, epidemiologic and experimental observations raise a number of possibilities.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	18	 First, the development of malignant cells from primary cells frequently requires alterations in apoptosis or cell cycle control.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Because myeloid malignancies predominantly occur in the context of progressive apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic progenitors in patients with FA9 and in Fancc-/- mice,10 it has been hypothesized that leukemogenesis results from an accumulation of mutations that precipitates the emergence of apoptotic-resistant precursors.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Second, p53 is a pivotal sensor of genotoxic and nongenotoxic stress and activates signaling pathways that result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The apoptosis in FANCC-deficient lymphoblasts has previously been shown to be due to activation of protein kinase R (PKR).
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	22	11 Because p53 is a downstream effector of PKR,12-14 inactivation or polymorphisms of p53 or proteins in the p53 pathway may be an important target for cellular transformation in FA-associated myeloid malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Third, patients with FA are predisposed to solid tumors, including epithelial and squamous cell carcinomas, which have a high rate of p53 alteration in sporadic malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	24	15,16 The risk of these solid tumors in patients with FA goes up markedly after 20 years of age and increases to a cumulative risk of 90% by 40 years of age.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	25	2 Finally, recent studies have positioned the FA proteins in a biochemical pathway that includes BRCA1 and BRCA2.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	26	17,18 In fact, truncating, hypomorphic mutations of BRCA2 were observed in the FA-D1 complementation group.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	27	18 Further, studies using Brca1 and Brca2 conditional knockout mice support a role for p53 in tumor progression.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although epidemiologic and biochemical data suggest a role for p53 in mediating apoptosis and cancer in FA, a previous study found that a dominant-negative p53 did not affect apoptosis in FANCC-deficient, immortalized lymphoblasts exposed to genotoxic stress.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	29	22 However, the use of immortalized cell lines that may have altered p53 function23 is an inherent limitation in those studies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, to model endogenous stresses incurred by the organism in vivo, we performed a genetic intercross of Fancc and Trp53 mutant mice to characterize how these genes interact in mediating apoptosis and tumorigenesis.

0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Recent data have demonstrated that the apoptotic function of p53 is critical in protection from tumorigenesis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	184	38,39 Our genetic evidence indicates that the increased stress-induced apoptosis observed in Fancc-deficient cells is, at least in part, p53 dependent.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitors was abrogated in the absence of p53 at all doses of the cytotoxic cytokine TNF-, which does not induce DNA damage.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Disruption of Trp53 in Fancc-/- cells reduced apoptosis to that of Fancc+/+ cells at low but not high doses of mitomycin C, indicating that apoptosis induced by cross-linking agents in Fancc mutant cells was only partially p53 dependent.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	187	 DNA cross-linking agents, including mitomycin C, induce breaks and lesions that signal the activation of p53,40 and induce apoptosis largely by p53-dependent mechanisms.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	188	41 However, in our studies there was a significant p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis mediating the hypersensitivity of Fancc-deficient cells to mitomycin C, as was also observed previously in other FANCC-deficient cells.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	189	22 A potential candidate to consider in future studies that may mediate apoptosis in Fancc-deficient cells is the p53-related protein, p73.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	190	 p73 is able to activate the transcription of p53-dependent promoters.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	191	42 In addition, others have shown that p73 functions in the absence of p53 in mediating apoptosis induced by cross-linking and other proapoptotic agents.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	192	43,44 Therefore, functional p73 may be able to induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 in Fancc-/-Trp53-/- cells as the dose of mitomycin C is increased.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	193	FA proteins have been implicated in a range of "caretaker" functions including DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and redox modulation that collectively function to maintain genomic integrity (for a review, see Joenje and Patel5).
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	194	 There are at least 3 potential mechanisms to explain the cooperation between Trp53 and Fancc.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	195	 First, abnormalities in FA functions can lead to basal and genotoxic-induced chromosome instability.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In this model p53 is activated following stress to limit cell growth or to initiate apoptosis of oncogenic cells as a mechanism of tumor avoidance.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Thus, we speculate that the modestly increased p53 protein levels observed in Fancc-deficient cells in the current report (Figure 1) following genotoxic or nongenotoxic stress could be a result of intrinsic genomic instability present in these cells, which is detected by the signaling network that activates p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	198	 An important priority in future studies will be to examine the role of p53 in suppressing genetic mutations in Fancc-deficient mice using a marker of genetic instability such as hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	199	A second possibility is suggested by studies linking the function of the FA protein members with the BRCA1-dependent mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2, and the identification of BRCA2 mutations in the FA-D1 complementation group.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	200	 BRCA1 was reported to physically interact with p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	201	45,46 Further, mammary cells from Brca1 knockout mice undergo increased apoptosis that is alleviated in the absence of Trp53 and acquire mammary cell malignancies on loss of p53 function.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	202	19 Interestingly, like Fancc-/- mice, basal p53 protein was increased in Brca1 conditional mutant mice, compared to wild-type mice.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	203	21 In contrast, whereas Fancc-/- cells have slightly increased p53 activity following DNA damage, Brca1-/- cells have reduced levels of induced p53 protein compared to wild-type controls.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Therefore, although FA proteins functionally interact with BRCA1,17 based on the current and previously published21 murine models, the specific cooperation that p53 has with Fancc and Brca1, respectively, is distinct.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Studies have also demonstrated cooperation between BRCA2 and p53.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In one study, the activity and function of p53 in Brca2-deficient cells was elevated, analogous to our studies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	207	47 Further, loss of p53 in conditional Brca2-deficient mice is associated with a decreased latency of tumorigenesis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	208	20 The precise biochemical relationship between p53 and Brca2 may be due to an interaction of these proteins with the homologous recombination machinery, because a physical association between Brca2 and p53 has been demonstrated in a complex that also contains Rad51.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	209	48 These studies therefore raise the interesting possibility that Fancc also may functionally interact with p53 in a DNA repair or cell cycle pathway.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	210	Lastly, Fancc may affect the p53 network by negatively regulating PKR.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Fancc was recently shown to directly interact with the Hsp70 protein, and this interaction inhibits the function of PKR in executing apoptosis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	212	35,49 Given that p53 is activated by PKR,13,14 these studies suggest the possibility that Fancc could function in a complex that is closely associated with regulating p53 function via PKR.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	213	Although Fancc-/- mice with intact Trp53 do not develop tumors, genetic loss of both Fancc and Trp53 results in a markedly shortened latency of tumorigenesis in a Trp53 gene dose-dependent fashion.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Further, the spectrum of tumors observed in the intercrossed mice overlaps with that observed in patients with FA.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The data are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of p53 or its effectors has an important role in malignant progression in human FA tumors, particularly considering that patients with FA are highly predisposed to head and neck cancers and epithelial malignancies.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	216	3 Others have shown that inactivation of p53 occurs in the majority of these types of malignancies, usually by either mutation15 or inactivation due to papilloma virus infection.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	217	50-54 Data from this report support the rationale for a thorough evaluation of the p53 pathway in malignancies in patients with FA.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	218	In summary, the present study in mice has identified p53 as an important cofactor with Fancc in suppressing tumorigenesis.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Our findings establish that p53 is an important modulator of apoptosis in Fancc-deficient mice in vitro and is consistent with the observations that mice mutant at both loci acquire tumors at an accelerated rate in vivo.
0.52467555.12855557.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Finally, these mice provide a model to address fundamental aspects of FA and to test molecular therapeutic strategies.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, September 16, 2004 , and in revised form, February 3, 2005.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor p53 functions as a transcriptional activator to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Although p53 was also shown to mediate apoptosis in a manner independent of its transactivation activity, the mechanism and conditions that trigger such cell death have remained largely unknown.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have now shown that inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription by -amanitin or RNA interference induced p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Inhibition of pol II-mediated transcription resulted in down-regulation of p21Cip1, which was caused by both transcriptional suppression and protein degradation, despite eliciting p53 accumulation, allowing the cells to progress into S phase and then to undergo apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This cell death did not require the transcription of p53 target genes and was preceded by translocation of the accumulated p53 to mitochondria.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Our data thus suggested that blockade of pol II-mediated transcription induced p53 accumulation in mitochondria and was the critical factor for eliciting p53-dependent but transcription-independent apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apoptosis is a genetically controlled mechanism of cell death that is essential for the elimination of unwanted cells during normal development and for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The tumor suppressor protein p53 induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including DNA damage, oncogene activation, and hypoxia (1-3).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Loss of p53 function therefore results in failure to remove damaged cells and contributes both to tumor development and to the resistance of cancer cells to therapies based on the induction of DNA damage.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	12	It is well established that p53 is a transcriptional regulator and that p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage is predominantly attributable both to the transcriptional activation of genes that encode apoptotic effectors, such as the BH3-only proteins Noxa and PUMA, Bax, p53AIP1, and PERP (4-9), as well as to the transcriptional repression of genes for antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 (10) and survivin (11).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition to such transcriptional regulation, however, recent evidence has suggested the existence of a transcription-independent pathway of p53-mediated apoptosis (12, 13).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	14	 A fraction of the p53 molecules that accumulate in damaged cells translocates to mitochondria, and this translocation is sufficient for p53 to induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane through formation of complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (14, 15).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The mechanism by which the relative activities of the transcription-dependent and transcription-independent pathways of p53-mediated apoptosis are regulated, however, has remained unclear.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	16	Lesions in the transcribed strand of DNA induced by high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin or by high doses of UV radiation trigger the ubiquitination and consequent degradation of the large subunit (LS)1 of RNA polymerase II (pol II), resulting in transcriptional collapse and the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16, 17).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A prolonged blockage of pol II-dependent transcription caused by failure to repair such DNA lesions results in cell death by apoptosis (18).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Furthermore, -amanitin, a specific inhibitor of pol II-dependent transcription, also induces apoptosis (19).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Given that pol II is responsible for the transcription of most protein-coding genes, new transcription of proapoptotic genes would not be expected to contribute to apoptosis induced by pol II inhibition or degradation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although it is possible that such cell death is triggered by impaired expression of downstream survival factors, the precise mechanism of apoptosis elicited by transcriptional blockade remains unknown.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	21	We have now investigated the molecular mechanism of apoptosis that occurs in response to transcriptional block caused by exposure of cells to -amanitin, RNA interference, or to a high dose of UV radiation.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	69	 -Amanitin binds directly to the LS of pol II (26) and specifically induces its ubiquitination and consequent degradation (27).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Consistent with previous observations (28), cells treated with -amanitin manifested a time-dependent decrease in the total amount of mRNA and were unable to resume mRNA synthesis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	71	 1A, flow cytometry revealed that exposure of parental HCT116 (p53+/+) cells to -amanitin resulted in a substantial increase in the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, knock-out of p53 (p53-/-) markedly reduced the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to death induced by -amanitin, indicating that the apoptosis elicited by these pol II inhibitors is p53-dependent.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	73	To validate further these results, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to abrogate expression of the pol II large subunit, which is an alternative approach to inhibit pol II-dependent transcription.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Transfection of cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) specific for the pol II large subunit resulted in reduction in levels of the protein (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Similar to the data obtained by -amanitin, depletion of pol II significantly induced apoptosis in p53+/+ HCT116 cells but not in p53-/- HCT116 cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	76	To confirm whether -amanitin induces cell death by activation of apoptotic pathways, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based assay that measures the level of cytoplasmic nucleosomal DNA fragments (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Consistent with the data obtained by flow cytometry, -amanitin induced a substantially larger increase in the amount of cytoplasmic DNA fragments in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the p53-/- cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Microscopic observation of HCT116 cells stained with PI also revealed that -amanitin induced a marked increase in the proportion of cells with fragmented chromatin (supplemental Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Adenovirus-mediated expression of p53, but not that of luciferase, indeed restored the sensitivity of p53-/- cells to -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	106	To verify that the p53 accumulation elicited by -amanitin was not attributable to the induction of DNA damage, we checked for the presence of the -H2AX complex, which can be a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (31, 32), in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells by immunofluorescence analysis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	107	 To avoid the detection of DSBs attributable to apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we examined cells for the presence of -H2AX foci 18 h after exposure to drugs (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Whereas adriamycin induced the formation of -H2AX foci, -amanitin did not, even though substantial p53 accumulation was apparent at this time point.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	109	 These results suggest that the accumulation of p53 induced by -amanitin is not caused by the induction of DSBs.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	110	The accumulation and activation of p53 are regulated by post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and acetylation (33).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Given that phosphorylation of p53 contributes to both the stabilization and activation of the protein, we examined the time course of p53 phosphorylation on Ser15 and Ser46 in p53+/+ HCT116 cells treated with adriamycin or -amanitin (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Adriamycin-induced Ser15 phosphorylation was apparent at 3 h, as was p53 accumulation; an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of Ser46 was not apparent until 6 h, consistent with the delay in the phosphorylation of this residue compared with that of Ser15 observed previously in adriamycin-treated cells (6).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In contrast, an increase in the extent of Ser46 phosphorylation was apparent at 12 h, coincident with the onset of p53 accumulation, and Ser15 phosphorylation was not detected until 24 h in cells treated with -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These results thus suggest that -amanitin triggers a slower p53 response in comparison to adriamycin and may activate a signaling pathway that differs from that responsible for the p53 stabilization in response to DNA damage.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	145	  Translocation of p53 to Mitochondria in -Amanitin-treated Cells Recent studies have suggested that p53-dependent apoptosis can occur in the absence of gene transcription (12, 13) and that a fraction of p53 molecules that accumulate in response to DNA damage translocates to mitochondria and thereby promotes apoptosis (14, 15).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We therefore examined whether p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to mitochondria.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Confocal microscopic analysis was carried out by using MRC-5 human normal fibroblasts that have wild-type p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	148	 MRC-5 cells are suitable for investigating the subcellular distribution of endogenous p53 because the cells have flat and large morphology and can be easily observed cytoplasmic structures.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We also confirmed that -amanitin elicits p53 accumulation and apoptosis in MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	150	 S5, A and B) as observed in HCT116 cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Although p53 protein was detectable at a low level in the nuclei of untreated cells, it was present in increased amounts in -amanitin-treated cells and was localized to mitochondria in a substantial proportion of these cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Cell fractionation experiments also demonstrate that p53 accumulated by -amanitin treatment is primarily detected in mitochondrial fractions, and those mitochondrial p53 molecules are phosphorylated on Ser15 and/or Ser46 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These findings thus suggest that p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade translocate to the mitochondria, which may activate the apoptotic program.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	154	-Amanitin Treatment Does Not Induce G1 Arrest and Allows S Phase Entry -Amanitin increased the size of the cell population in S phase in a p53-independent manner (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Depletion of pol II LS by siRNA also increased the population of S phase cells in comparison to control siRNA treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Therefore, to investigate further the effect of -amanitin on cell cycle progression, HCT116 cells were first incubated with -amanitin or other reagents alone and then in the absence or presence of nocodazole, which induces cell cycle arrest in prometaphase through activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Consistent with previous observations (36), treatment of the cells with actinomycin D, which is an RNA polymerase I inhibitor, or adriamycin resulted in G1 or G2 arrest, respectively (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In contrast, cells treated with -amanitin incorporated BrdUrd and accumulated predominantly in the S phase (61%); they neither arrested in G1 nor entered M phase regardless of whether or not they were exposed to nocodazole (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Whereas the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was dephosphorylated in cells treated with adriamycin, it was highly phosphorylated in -amanitin-treated cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	160	 5C) as it was in cells exposed to a DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which induced S phase arrest.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Furthermore, the abundance of ICBP90, a nuclear protein whose expression is down-regulated during DNA damage-induced G1 arrest (20), was not affected by treatment of HCT116 cells with -amanitin, whereas it was decreased by treatment with adriamycin or actinomycin D (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Together, these findings suggest that cells exposed to -amanitin progress through the G1-S transition and arrest in S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	163	We next investigated the mechanism by which -amanitintreated cells are able to enter S phase even though they manifest accumulation of p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	164	 DNA damage is known to induce expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21Cip1 via p53-dependent transactivation (25).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	165	 p21Cip1 binds to and inhibits the activity of both PCNA and the complexes of CDK2 with cyclin A or cyclin E, thereby blocking progression of cells from G1 to S (37).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Given that the levels of p21Cip1 protein and mRNA were down-regulated in both the -amanitin-treated cells and the siRNA-mediated pol II-depleted cells (Figs.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	167	 S1), cells might be able to enter S phase despite p53 accumulation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	168	 To address this issue further, we monitored changes in the levels of p21Cip1 during cell cycle progression of the -amanitin-treated cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	169	 HCT116 cells were synchronized at metaphase by nocodazole treatment and then released into fresh medium containing -amanitin or actinomycin D, the latter of which stabilizes p53, up-regulates p21Cip1 expression, and induces G1 arrest.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The size of the G1 population was markedly reduced and that of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) population was increased for cells treated with -amanitin compared with the corresponding populations of cells treated with actinomycin D or those left untreated.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of p21Cip1 protein was reduced in cells exposed to -amanitin, although it was markedly increased in response to actinomycin D (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	172	The abundance of p21Cip1 is regulated not only by transcriptional induction but also by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (38).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	173	 To examine whether the -amanitin-induced down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression was attributable to protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we treated HCT116 cells with -amanitin in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The decrease in the amount of p21Cip1 induced by -amanitin was prevented by MG132 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	175	 5F), indicating that p21Cip1 undergoes ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in response to -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Thus, both transcriptional suppression and protein degradation appear to prevent the accumulation of p21Cip1 in -amanitin-treated cells and thereby lead to S phase entry.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We therefore investigated whether cells treated with -amanitin undergo apoptosis as they enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	208	 HCT116 cells were synchronized at G0-G1 by serum deprivation and then re-exposed to serum in the absence or presence of -amanitin (Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In addition, treatment with -amanitin resulted in a large increase in the number of cells positive for M30 CytoDeath antibody, which recognizes a specific caspase cleavage product of cytokeratin 18 and can be a marker of early apoptosis, at the time (24 h after release) when the cells began to accumulate in S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Furthermore, this apoptotic marker was detected in the -amanitin-treated cells during early S phase but not at G2-M phase, suggesting that -amanitin induces p53-dependent apoptosis as cells enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This notion is further supported by the immunocyto-chemical finding that -amanitin-treated cells in which p53 was localized to mitochondria preferentially incorporate BrdUrd, indicating that they had entered S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	213	We next tested the possibility that induction of G1 arrest is able to block -amanitin-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The plant amino acid mimosine blocks the cell cycle in late G1 phase by inducing the up-regulation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (40).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Mimosine markedly inhibited the -amanitin-induced increase in the size of the sub-G1 (apoptotic) cell population (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the CDK inhibitors p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 also induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and prevented -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Specifically, these results suggest that S phase entry is required for the apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	218	Accumulation of p53 and Down-regulation of p21Cip1 Lead to Apoptosis We then examined whether down-regulation of p21Cip1 is also required for the induction of apoptosis by -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Treatment of p21-/- HCT116 cells with -amanitin resulted in p53 accumulation and massive apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This finding raised the hypothesis that p53 accumulation without p21Cip1 induction triggers the apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	221	 We thus constructed this condition by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of p53 in the p21-/- cells, and we found that this combination induces massive apoptosis without -amanitin treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Furthermore, pifithrin-, a specific inhibitor of p53-mediated transcriptional activation (41), did not inhibit the induction of apoptosis in p21-/- HCT116 cells by overexpression of p53 (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	223	 7B), suggesting that the transactivation activity of p53 does not contribute to this effect.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These findings suggest the possibility that the p53-mediated transactivation-independent apoptosis is triggered by the accumulation of p53 without p21Cip1 induction.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	225	To verify further that transcriptional blockade induces p53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis, we used cells expressing a transactivation-deficient p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We established p53-/- HCT116 cells stably expressing wild-type p53 or a truncated form of p53-(1-39) (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	227	 p53-(1-39) lacks an N-terminal transactivation domain (residues 1-39), which is thus unable to transactivate p21Cip1 expression (42).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Treatment with -amanitin induced apoptosis in cells not only expressing wild-type p53 but also in cells expressing p53-(1-39), although the p53-/- HCT116 cells were insensitive to -amanitin treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These results thus support our hypothesis that apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade is p53-dependent but transactivation-independent.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	230	High Dose UV Irradiation Induces Transcription-independent p53-mediated Apoptosis Here we showed that inhibition of pol II by -amanitin treatment or siRNA approach resulted in the p53 accumulation without p21Cip1 induction, leading to apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	231	 We wanted to find out whether there is any biological condition inducing this type of cell death.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	232	 As reported previously (16), exposure of HCT116 cells to a high dose of UV radiation (30 J/m2) induced the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of pol II LS, resulting in transcriptional blockade and apoptosis 24 h after the treatment (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This treatment actually induced p53 accumulation and p21Cip1 down-regulation (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	234	 7D, left panel), biochemical effects identical to those of -amanitin and pol II LS siRNA.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In addition, the high dose UV-induced p53 was predominantly detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Together, these findings thus suggest that accumulation of p53 in mitochondria with down-regulation of p21Cip1, which resulted from transcriptional blockade, leads to apoptosis in high dose UV-irradiated cells.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	237	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Blockade of pol II-dependent transcription has been shown previously to trigger a cell death signal (28).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	238	 However, the mechanism that underlies such apoptosis has remained undefined.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Furthermore, recent observations have revealed that p53 can directly translocate to the mitochondria and induce apoptosis in a transactivation-independent manner (14, 15), but the mechanisms triggering this apoptosis have remained unclear.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	240	 We now provide evidence that links these two events.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Inhibition of pol II by -amanitin treatment, RNAi approach, and high dose UV irradiation induces p53 accumulation without induction of p21Cip1, entry of cells into S phase, and p53-dependent but transactivation-independent cell death mediated by the translocation of p53 to mitochondria.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Our data thus yield new insight into the mechanism of cell death induced by transcriptional blockade.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	243	Inhibition of pol II by -Amanitin Induces p53 Accumulation and p53-dependent Apoptosis Apoptosis induced by -amanitin was markedly greater in extent in p53+/+ HCT116 cells than in the corresponding p53-/- cells and was blocked in the presence of a caspase inhibitor, indicating that transcriptional blockade induces p53-dependent, caspase-mediated apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Furthermore, this notion was supported by the finding that the -amanitin-resistant p53-/- cells underwent apoptosis by expression of exogenous p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The accumulation of p53 appeared to be attributable to inhibition of p53 degradation, given that the amount of p53 mRNA was actually reduced by -amanitin treatment.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	246	 These findings are consistent with previous results (43), showing that the accumulation of p53 induced by inhibition of pol II-dependent transcription results from down-regulation of MDM2 gene transcription.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Therefore, in addition to the MDM2 down-regulation-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by modification of p53 protein may contribute to p53 accumulation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In fact, we also found that -amanitin induces p53 phosphorylation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The phosphorylation of p53, which is mediated by various stress-activated kinases (44), contributes to the stabilization and activation of the protein.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The DNA-damaging agent adriamycin induced the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, which is reportedly mediated by the kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (45) and results in p53 accumulation, before that on Ser46.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In contrast, -amanitin induced p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 before the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15, and the former reaction coincided with the accumulation of p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Transcriptional blockade by -amanitin might thus result in the activation of stress-activated kinases that are distinct from those activated by DNA-damaging agents and that phosphorylate and thereby stabilize p53.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Indeed, caffeine, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, did not inhibit -amanitin-induced p53 phosphorylation and accumulation,2 suggesting that these kinases do not contribute to the effects of -amanitin.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	254	 We also found that transcriptional blockade did not activate the Chk1 (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Furthermore, -amanitin did not induce p53 accumulation in M059J cells (46), which are deficient in the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (supplemental Fig.

0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	286	  Cells Treated with -Amanitin Undergo Apoptosis on Entry into S Phase The accumulation of p53 in response to DNA damage results in the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes whose products either induce cell cycle arrest (such as p21Cip1) or trigger apoptosis.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	287	 However, we found that the expression of p21Cip1 was down-regulated by -amanitin as a result of both suppression of gene transcription and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The -amanitin-treated cells were thus prevented from arresting at G1 phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In addition, we found that the abundance of p27Kip1, another CDK2 inhibitor, was also down-regulated by -amanitin treatment in HCT116 and MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Thus, despite the fact that they accumulate p53, cells treated with -amanitin proceed to S phase, as confirmed by the status of pRb phosphorylation, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, and BrdUrd incorporation.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 might possibly be due to cleavage by the CPP32-like caspase during apoptosis (47).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, the abundance of p21Cip1 in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells was reduced prior to the appearance of the apoptotic phenotype (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Moreover, Skp2, which is a subunit of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein ubiquitin ligase that controls the proteolysis of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 (48-50), was up-regulated in -amanitin-treated HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	294	 S10), suggesting that signaling activated by transcriptional blockade results in the activation of Skp2, which then mediates the down-regulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	295	Overexpression of exogenous p53 markedly enhanced cell death in p21-/- HCT116 cells (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	296	 7B), suggesting that the entry of cells with phosphorylated and accumulated p53 and down-regulated p21Cip1 into S phase is an important trigger for apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Several lines of evidence suggest that transcriptional blockade elicits cell death as cells enter S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	298	 1) Synchronized cells released from nocodazole block in the presence of -amanitin underwent pronounced apoptosis during S phase (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	299	 2) Induction of G1 arrest by treatment of cells with mimosine or by overexpression of p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 resulted in marked suppression of -amanitin-induced apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	300	 3) Withdrawal of mimosine from -amanitin-treated cells led to massive apoptosis (Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Inhibition of CDK activity and induction of cell cycle arrest by p21Cip1 has been shown previously to play an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis (51, 52).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Together, these various observations suggest that transcriptional block by inhibition of pol II activity results in cell cycle arrest during DNA replication and induces apoptosis in S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	303	Transcriptional Blockade Induces Translocation of p53 to Mitochondria and Consequent Apoptosis in S Phase Many genes whose products mediate p53-dependent cell death have been identified.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Several p53 target genes encode proteins that localize to mitochondria and affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, an important determinant of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	305	 These proteins include Bax, Noxa, PUMA, and p53AIP1.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	306	 We found that the accumulation of p53 induced by -amanitin did not result in the transcriptional activation of any of the p53 target genes examined.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Furthermore, the abundance of Bax and Apaf-1, which are also p53-inducible gene products (53), was not affected by -amanitin treatment in HCT116 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	308	 These observations thus suggest that apoptosis induced by transcriptional blockade is mediated by p53 in a transcription-independent manner.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	309	Evidence suggests that p53 is able to directly engage the major apoptotic pathways in the cell, promoting both death receptor signaling and mitochrondrial perturbations, without requiring gene induction.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	310	 A fraction of accumulated p53 molecules also translocates to the mitochondria and thereby promotes apoptosis in cells with DNA damage (15).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The p53 protein directly induces permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with the protective proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	312	 It has also been shown to activate and to induce the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, again resulting in cytochrome c release (54).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	313	 However, specific cellular contexts that trigger the transcription-independent translocation of p53 to mitochondria remain obscure.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	314	 We found that -amanitin-mediated transcriptional blockade induces p53 localization to mitochondria and that a substantial proportion of Bax molecules also translocates to mitochondria in -amanitin-treated MRC-5 cells (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Moreover, the p53 molecules that translocated to mitochondria in -amanitin-treated cells included those phosphorylated on Ser15 and Ser46, and such translocation was detected in cells at S phase.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Based on this evidence, we speculate that the p53 molecules that accumulate in response to transcriptional blockade trigger apoptosis directly by acting at mitochondria.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	317	Biological Significance of p53-mediated Apoptosis Induced by Transcriptional Blockade The induction of DNA lesions by high doses of UV radiation results in the ubiquitination and degradation of pol II LS, transcriptional collapse, and recruitment of DNA repair proteins (16, 17).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Prolonged inhibition of transcription as a result of a failure to repair such DNA lesions results in cell death by apoptosis (18).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Indeed, we found that high dose UV radiation induced pol II degradation, p53 accumulation, down-regulation of p21Cip1 expression, and p53-dependent apoptosis, similar to the effects of -amanitin treatment.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	320	 UV irradiation was shown previously to induce transcription of the c-jun gene and to modulate the association of p53 with the promoter of the p21Cip1 gene, resulting in repression of p21Cip1 gene activation and cell death (55).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Therefore, in addition to the c-Jun-mediated pathway, signaling triggered by transcriptional blockade at the sites of unrepaired DNA lesions may contribute to UV-induced apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	322	It is interesting to know how much the transactivation-independent apoptosis contributes to the p53-mediated cell death.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	323	 When HCT116 (p53+/+) cells were treated with adriamycin in the presence of -amanitin, the cell death was significantly enhanced in comparison to adriamycin treatment alone even though the p53-mediated gene expression is blocked (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	324	 This observation implies that p53 accumulated by DNA damage can elicit apoptosis via both transactivation-dependent and -independent pathways.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	325	It has been reported recently that many of the common DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin are known to interfere with transcription (56).
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Therefore, translocation of p53 to mitochondria may serve as a fail-safe mechanism to elicit apoptosis for eliminating cells whose transcription is blocked by severe and irreparable DNA damages (supplemental Fig.
0.629985.15753095.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Loss-of-function mutations in the p53 gene might thus abrogate both the transcription-dependent and mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic activities of p53 and thereby lead to the survival of transformed cells.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	3	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   The protein phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoting agent okadaic acid (OA), has been shown previously to induce hyperphosphorylation of p53 protein, which in turn correlated with increased transactivation or apoptotic function.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	4	 However, how the tumor promotion effects of OA relate to p53 tumor supressor function (or dysfunction) remain unclear.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Rat embryonic fibroblasts harboring a temperature-sensitive mouse p53 transgene were treated with 50 nM doses of OA.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	6	 At the wild-type permissive temperature this treatment resulted in: (i) the hyperphosphorylation of sites within tryptic peptides of the transactivation domain of p53; (ii) an increase in p53 affinity for a p21waf1 promotor oligonucleotide; (iii) an increase in cellular steady state levels of p21waf1 message; (iv) a G2/M cell cycle blockage in addition to the G1/S arrest previously associated with p53; and (v) no increased incidence of apoptosis.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	7	 On the other hand, OA treatment at the mutated p53 permissive temperature resulted in a relatively high incidence of aberrant mitosis with no upregulation of p21waf1 message.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These results suggest that while wild-type p53 blocks the proliferative effects of OA through p21waf1-mediated growth arrest, cells with non-functional p53 cannot arrest and suffer relatively high levels of OA-mediated aberrant mitoses.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Accordingly, many studies have focused on phosphorylation and the regulation of p53-mediated function.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	14	One approach to the question of phosphorylation and p53 function involves the use of okadaic acid (OA).

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Presumably through its effects on phosphorylation, OA is known to have regulatory effects on many gene products ranging from transcription factors to matrix metalloproteases (reviewed in ref.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Since OA treatment originally was shown to result in hyperphosphorylation of p53 from primary human fibroblasts, hyperphosphorylation was presumed to inactivate p53 as a means of tumor promotion (8).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, OA treatment now is generally thought to upregulate the tumor suppressor activities of p53 through hyperphosphorylation in both the transcriptional transactivation (serines 4, 6 and 15) and DNA binding domains (serines 313, 390 and possibly 309) (9,10).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	20	Many experiments have shown OA to have differing biochemical and functional effects on p53.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For example, at the level of transcription of p53, OA treatment appeared to decrease p53 mRNA levels (11).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	22	 On the other hand, p53 protein has been reported to be stabilized by OA treatment in some cell types (12) but unaffected in others (10).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In terms of DNA binding, p53 hyperphosphorylation mediated by OA treatment shows increased affinity for both the ribosomal gene cluster (RGC) and p53 consensus sequence (p53Con) oligonucleotides (9,12,13).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Yet p53 transcriptional transactivation, as measured through the activities of RGC and p53Con luciferase constructs, is decreased by exposure to OA (12).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, in other cell types, OA treatment can lead to increased transactivation of mdm2, p21waf1 and bax promoter constructs (10).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Interestingly, in terms of programmed cell death, it has recently been shown that OA-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis correlated with increased overall (sites unknown) levels of p53 phosphorylation, but did not require p53-mediated transactivation (14).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	27	 While these experiments have revealed many insights into the functional role of p53 phosphorylation, investigation of cellular mechanisms through which OA mediates its effects may help to refine our understanding of the `phosphoregulation' of p53 and its role in pathways of tumor promotion with OA.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	28	Our approach has consisted of comparing the biochemical and functional consequences of OA on a rat embryonic fibroblast cell line harboring a constitutively expressed mouse transgene (p53val135).

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Coincident with this shift to wild-type function, p53 phosphorylation and steady state levels of p21waf1 both show an endogenous `background' increase (i.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, by 6 h after incubation at 32 degrees C, p53 returns to basal levels of phosphorylation (16).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We asked how treatment with OA could affect the in vivo phosphorylation and function of p53 in A1-5 cells containing either the wild-type or non-functional mutant p53.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Our data indicate that OA treatment of cells at the wild-type temperature led to hyperphosphorylation of specific p53 phosphorylation sites and that prolonged exposure results in upregulation of p53 DNA binding, an increase in p21waf1 steady state mRNA, and both G1 and G2/M growth suppression that is not related to an increase in apoptosis.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In contrast, OA treatment of cells with non-functional p53 did not upregulate p21waf1 and led to relatively high levels of aberrant mitosis.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	77	  Since in some cases, OA treatment has been known to affect steady state levels of p53 message or protein (11,12), western analyses were performed on 10  microg of total protein from A1-5 cells.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In three separate experiments using varied film exposure times, we observed no change in the steady state protein levels of OA-treated samples relative to solvent-only controls at 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24 h intervals (data not shown).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Therefore, we concluded that upregulation of p53 protein levels could not account for the increase of p53 phosphorylation or function observed in the experiments that follow.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	103	 As indicated in Table II, OA treated wild-type p53 cell samples scored no higher than untreated cells in terms of apoptotic bodies.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	104	 However, mutant p53 cells treated with OA showed a higher incidence of `aberrant mitosis' as inferred through uniformly stained, randomly distributed chromosomes within their nuclei, as seen in Figure 5.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	106	 OA treatment does not increase the level of apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells, but does increase levels of aberrant mitoses in mutant p53 cells.

0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	108	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Despite the fact that many aspects of p53 phosphorylation have become better understood in recent years, a clear picture of how OA-induced phosphorylation affects p53 function has yet to emerge.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Combining the use of OA with the A1-5 cell line offers some unique advantages.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	110	 First, experiments can be done without the complications resulting from DNA damage-induced p53.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Secondly, unlike in vitro or insect cell systems, differences in p53 function resulting from OA treatment can be assayed in a previously characterized, intact mammalian cell environment that may model basic mechanisms of tumor promotion found in vivo.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	112	 For example, OA treatment leads to a highly phosphorylated transactivation domain of p53 expressed in A1-5 cells in a manner analogous to the N-terminal phosphorylation seen when p53 activity and expression is increased by DNA damage commonly associated with tumor cells (25).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Nonetheless, data gleaned from the use of A1-5 cells should be interpreted cautiously given the complexity of OA's effects on multiple pathways and proteins as discussed in more detail below.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	114	Building upon several other recent studies supporting the functional importance of p53 N-terminal phosphorylation at multiple sites (10,13,26,27), our data suggest a physiological pathway through which phosphorylation could upregulate wild-type p53-mediated growth suppression in vivo.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	115	 This pathway would involve specifically N-terminal phosphorylation of p53, the upregulation of p53 DNA binding to the p21waf1 promoter, and higher steady-state levels of p21waf1 mRNA.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Since it has been noted previously that p21waf1 can inhibit many different cyclin to cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (28) and that p53 can mediate both G2/M and G1 cell cycle blockage in cell lines containing p53val135 (15,29), we decided to utilize flow cytometry to link p53 phosphorylation and elevated levels of p21waf1 with a functional end point, growth suppression.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Although OA is known to have pleiotropic cellular affects, the G2/M cell cycle blockage resulting from OA treatment appears to be wild-type p53 dependent as no such block takes place in the mutant p53 bearing cells, which continue to grow but show comparatively high incidences of aberrant mitoses and apoptosis.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	118	One obvious implication of these data is the association of one or more endogenous protein phosphatase activities with the downregulation of p53.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Mechanistically, protein phosphatase type 1 has a crucial role in cell cycle progression and is required for mitotic exit in yeast, fruit flies and mammalian systems (30).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Similarly, protein phosphatase type 2A is thought to be an important regulator of cell cycle progression in M and G1/S phases (7).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Functionally, OA inhibitable serine/threonine protein phosphatases may play a role in the regulation of p53 activity as they do for another tumor suppressor, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (31,32).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In this case, Rb is known to be activated by dephosphorylation through protein phosphatase type 1 so as to delay the onset of S-phase through the binding of the E2F transcription factor (30,31).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Connections between protein phosphatases and tumor suppression also exist.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	124	 For example, it has been shown that the tyrosine protein phosphatase, LAR, is associated with tumor suppression activity (33).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	125	 With these examples in mind, it is of interest to note that as yet undetermined sites within the N-terminus of p53 can be dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A in vitro (34).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Therefore, elucidating the physiological significance of dephosphorylation of particular amino acids is likely to increase our understanding of p53 regulation.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	127	Another implication of these data revolves around the question of the role of p53 in the OA tumor promotion pathway.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	128	 OA is now recognized as a general tumor promoter in various murine organs, including skin, glandular stomach and liver (35), but not much is known at the present time about its relevance to human cancers.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This is despite the fact that OA is known to be a causative agent of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, and microcystin, an OA-class compound, is common in ditch and other waste water (6).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	130	Since p53 first was shown to be hyperphosphorylated through OA treatment (8), it has been presumed that this would lead to functional inactivation.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, the data presented herein and by others argue that the opposite may in fact occur, i.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	132	 hyperphosphorylation wrought by OA may upregulate p53 function.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Yet, exactly which function or functions it upregulates appears to be complex.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	134	 As recent experiments have demonstrated, depending on cell lineage and on other factors, some injured cells undergo cell cycle arrest while others undergo apoptosis upon expression of wild-type p53 (36).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Moreover, upregulation of either function would, on the surface, seem to be at odds with the tumor promotion activity of OA.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	136	One possible point of reconciliation could involve an `indirect apoptotic mechanism' of OA mediated tumor promotion as was suggested by the recent work of Yan et al.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In other words, if OA treatment were to activate a p53-dependent apoptotic response, then the outgrowth of cells harboring dysfunctional p53 would be selectively fostered.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Accordingly, cells with inactive p53 may be encouraged to divide aberrantly through the pleiotropic effects of OA on cell growth [e.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	139	 the upregulation of the transcription factor AP-1 (7)], leading to the increased genetic instability characteristic of aneuoploid cancer cells (37).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This instability in turn may be compensated for by a non-p53 dependent apoptotic pathway.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Our data showing an increase of aberrant mitoses and apoptosis in cells with non-functional p53 would seem to support this model.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	142	 For, as we have demonstrated, OA treated cells with wild-type p53 undergo some aberrant mitoses, but the vast majority arrest in either G1 or G2.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In contrast, OA-treated cells with non-functional p53 do not appear to check growth, resulting in much higher levels of aberrant mitoses.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, these cells also appear to undergo a p53 independent pathway of apoptosis.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Although complex, this observation is in accordance with experiments showing that apoptosis in some cells may not involve p53 (36), or alternatively, that overexpression of mutant p53 and/or bcl-2 proteins may render some cells resistant to apoptosis altogether (38).
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	146	Taken together, these observations suggest that OA may be selecting for cells that have defects in both the ability to undergo growth arrest and apoptosis while upregulating certain growth inducing genes.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Experiments designed to determine the levels of gene transcripts associated with cell growth, combined with the introduction of either p53-dependent or -independent cell death expression vectors into OA treated cells harboring mutant p53, will help to distinguish between these possibilities.
0.53700596.10357786.html.plaintext.txt	148	 OA leads to cell cycle blockage in G2/M specifically in cells containing wild-type p53.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	10	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	11	Recent studies have implicated several proteins required for DNA damage recognition and repair in telomere maintenance.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The mammalian protein Ku, which binds double strand (ds)1 ends and is central to ds break repair has been shown to bind telomeric DNA directly (1, 2) and to associate with the two duplex telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 (3, 4).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Further, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast homolog yKu is required for proper telomere function (5).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	14	 (6) revealed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 is involved in the maintenance of telomeric tract length in mice.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	15	 They observed that although the level of telomere-associated fluorescence in p53/ mouse embryo fibroblasts was equivalent to that of wild type cells, there was an increased heterogeneity of telomere lengths with some telomeres being longer than those seen in wild type cells whereas others were very short or lost entirely.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These shortened telomeres resulted in a high frequency of telomere-telomere fusions.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	17	The telomere-specific protein TRF2 plays a central role in concealing telomere ends from ds break recognition and repair factors (7, 8).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Expression of a dominant-negative allele of TRF2 in cultured human cells triggers changes typical of those induced by ds breaks: loss of the 3' single strand (ss) overhang, induction of end-to-end chromosome fusions (8), and induction of apoptosis through the p53/ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway (7).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The induction of p53 is not dependent on DNA replication, suggesting that inhibition of TRF2 function at the telomeres signals p53 directly.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	20	Our recent studies of telomere architecture provide a possible structural solution to how telomere ends are hidden from DNA break repair/recognition factors.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These studies showed that mammalian telomeres are arranged into large duplex loops in vivo (t-loops) (9).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The formation of t-loops in vitro requires TRF2 and a telomeric junction, which consists of a 3' ss overhang of at least one TTAGGG repeat adjacent to the ds portion of the telomere (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The termini of the micronuclear chromosomes of Oxytricha nova (11), the telomeres of Trypanosoma brucei minichromosomes (12), and the telomeres of Pisum sativum2 have been shown to form looped structures in vivo whereas S.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	24	 cerevisiae telomeres appear to form fold-back structures (13-15).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	25	 It is plausible that telomeric looping is a common mechanism for protecting the termini of linear chromosomes.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	26	It has been proposed that the t-loop structure is formed by strand invasion of the G-rich ss overhang into the preceding duplex TTAGGG tract (9, 10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This invasion would generate a D-loop, which would effectively hide the natural end of the DNA to protect it from the machinery that scans DNA for broken ends.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition, recent data support the possibility that some portion of the C-rich strand of the ss/ds telomeric junction may also invade the duplex, resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction-like structure at the base of the t-loop (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	29	 p53 tightly binds Holliday junctions in vitro and enhances their resolution by junction-cleaving enzymes (16).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Further, p53 has a strong affinity for ss DNA (17) and would presumably bind the ss telomeric overhang of the telomere.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The affinity of p53 for these structures points to the importance of investigating p53 binding to both the telomeric overhang and the t-loop junction as well as examining the influence of p53 on t-loop assembly by TRF2 in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	32	Using electron microscopy (EM), we found that p53 was present at the t-loop junction both in the presence and absence of associated TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, localization of p53 to the 3' ss overhang was observed.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The mass of the p53 complex at the t-loop junction appeared consistent with the presence of one or two tetramers with a small portion of the molecules containing larger complexes.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	99	 It has been shown that p53 is capable of associating with DNA in both a sequence-dependent (reviewed in Refs.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	100	 23-25) and sequence-independent manner (26-27).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and EM were used to examine the affinity of p53 for duplex TTAGGG repeat tracts as well as for a model telomere containing a duplex tract adjacent to a ss 3' overhang containing TTAGGG repeats.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with p53 and a 200-bp DNA fragment consisting of tandem TTAGGG repeats.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Even with an input ratio of 30 tetramers per DNA molecule, p53 showed very low binding, and this was easily competed with nonspecific DNA (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	104	The association of p53 with telomeric repeats was examined by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	105	 p53 was incubated with a 96-repeat TTAGGG tract located in the center of a 3-kb DNA molecule.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	106	 At a ratio of 20 p53 tetramers per DNA molecule, 60% of the input template was bound by p53 with no molecule containing more than one p53 particle.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The location of p53 molecules along the DNA was measured from the micrographs, and the results revealed that of the bound DNA, 12% had p53 located within the telomeric tract, and the remaining 88% contained p53 randomly distributed along the length of the DNA (n = 200).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	108	 From these observations we conclude that p53 does not bind the TTAGGG repeat tract in a sequence-dependent manner.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	109	The binding of p53 to the natural telomeric overhang was examined by EM using a model telomere containing a terminal 576-bp duplex tract and an adjacent 54-nt 3' ss TTAGGG overhang (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	110	 1B; see "Experimental Procedures") (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Because p53 has been shown to bind ss DNA with high affinity, the non-telomeric end of the DNA terminated in a blunt end.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Conditions were optimized so that each DNA showed no more than one p53 particle bound (20 tetramers per DNA) (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Of the bound molecules, 68  plus or minus  9% (n = 100/sample, three experiments) contained p53 localized to the end of the DNA whereas the remainder (32  plus or minus  9% of the bound molecules, n = 100/sample, three experiments) showed p53 scattered at random along the length of the DNA (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Removal of the 3' overhang decreased the fraction of end-bound p53 to 6%, demonstrating that the end localization of p53 is most likely because of its association with the ss overhang.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Based on these data, we conclude that p53 binds to the ss telomeric overhang with strong affinity.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	116	TRF2-mediated t-Loop Formation Is Enhanced by p53-- It was of interest to examine the effect of p53 on the ability of TRF2 to form t-loops in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	117	 It is possible that p53 binding to the ss DNA overhang would inhibit loop formation by preventing TRF2 from localizing to the ss/ds junction, a critical step in t-loop assembly (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Alternately, binding to the ss overhang might enhance t-loop formation by facilitating the strand invasion event.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Studies from others have suggested that p53 has some strand transfer activity (28), which might either assist in TRF2-mediated loop formation or catalyze loop formation in the absence of TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Finally, p53 may stabilize loops once they are formed by binding to the t-loop junction either at the Holliday junction-like structure or the displaced ss portion of the D-loop.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	121	 To investigate these possibilities, p53 and TRF2 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The number of t-loops assembled was monitored by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	123	First, the possible interaction between p53 and TRF2 in the absence of DNA was examined.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	124	 To our knowledge, no evidence of such an association has been reported.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	125	 When p53 and TRF2 were coexpressed in SF9 cells and immunoprecipitated using standard techniques, no association was detected.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Similarly, when purified TRF2 was incubated with purified p53, the proteins failed to coimmunoprecipitate (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	127	When TRF2 and p53 were incubated together with the model telomere DNA, smaller loops could have been obscured because of the presence of a large protein mass at the junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Thus, an alternative approach for scoring looped molecules was utilized.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Following assembly of the complexes, the DNA molecules were photocross-linked, deproteinized, and prepared for EM examination using a classic surface-spreading method with cytochrome c (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Looped structures were rarely seen on the DNA in the absence of TRF2 (3  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) or when treated with p53 alone (4  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	131	 When the incubations contained TRF2 and no p53, 13% ( plus or minus 3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments) of the input DNA was assembled into t-loops.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This number is slightly reduced from the number of t-loops usually observed (10), most likely because of the use of a buffer optimized for the binding of both proteins.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	133	 When both p53 and TRF2 were added to the reaction (four p53 tetramers per DNA and three TRF2 dimers per TTAGGG repeat) the number of t-loops rose significantly (24  plus or minus  3%, n = 100/sample, three experiments; p = 0.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Reduction of the level of p53 (two p53 tetramers per DNA) eliminated this increase in t-loop assembly (14  plus or minus   < 1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	135	 No further rise in efficiency was detected with either increased levels of p53 (six or eight p53 tetramers per DNA; 23  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) or time of incubation (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	136	One possible explanation for the increase in the number of t-loops observed in the presence of TRF2 and p53 is that the t-loops may be stabilized by p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In vitro, t-loops may form and dissociate throughout the incubation.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The association of p53 with the displaced ss or the Holliday junction-like portion of the t-loop junction might stabilize the looped form, thus increasing the fraction of loops present at any one time.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In this case, any ss or Holliday junction binding protein would be expected to produce the same effect.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	140	 coli SSB, T4 gene 32 protein, and human RPA, were separately incubated with the model DNA and TRF2, and the loops were stabilized by AMT/UV cross-linking, deproteinized, and prepared for EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	141	 No increase in the number of t-loops was observed with the addition of SSB (14  plus or minus  1%, n = 100/sample, three experiments), T4 gene 32 protein (14  plus or minus  4%; n = 100/sample, three experiments), or human RPA (14  plus or minus  2%; n = 100/sample, three experiments) to the reaction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Similarly two Holliday junction-binding proteins, human MSH2/6 and HMG(I)Y, were separately incubated with the model DNA and TRF2, the DNA prepared for EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Neither MSH2/6 nor HMG(I)Y showed any ability to enhance TRF2-mediated t-loop assembly in vitro (13  plus or minus  2 and 15  plus or minus  1%, respectively; n = 100/sample, three experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	144	 These results suggest a more specific role for p53 in t-loop formation/stabilization.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	145	p53 may increase the numbers of t-loops by facilitating loop formation by TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Once bound to the overhang, p53 might assist in the strand invasion process.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Alternately, p53 might stabilize the assembled t-loops by binding directly to the t-loop junction (as contrasted to the displaced ss).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	148	 If binding to the overhang is responsible for the increase in t-loops, preincubation with p53 might be expected to further increase the numbers of t-loops formed as compared with preincubation with TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	149	 If, instead, p53 stabilizes the t-loop junction, preincubation with p53 would not be expected to further enhance t-loop formation.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	150	 To test these possibilities, p53 or TRF2 were first incubated individually with the model telomere DNA for 5 min followed by addition of the second protein for 15 min.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	151	 TRF2 assembled 13% ( plus or minus  < 1%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA into t-loops in the absence of p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	152	 When the DNA was preincubated with p53 followed by addition of TRF2, the number of t-loops rose to 20% ( plus or minus 7%, n = 100/sample, two experiments).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Similarly, 19% ( plus or minus 2%, n = 100/sample, two experiments) of the DNA molecules were looped when preincubated with TRF2 followed by addition of p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Thus the order of addition of p53 and TRF2 with the model telomere DNA does not affect the ability of p53 to enhance loop frequency.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Together, these data suggest that the p53-dependent increase in t-loop observed by EM is not due simply to binding of p53 to the ss overhang but instead may involve a more direct role of p53 on loop formation or stabilization.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	156	TRF2 Does Not Exclude p53 from Binding the t-Loop Junction-- The larger mass of protein present at the base of the t-loop when both p53 and TRF2 were present in the reaction suggests that the proteins are capable of binding to the junction simultaneously.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This possibility was examined using immunoelectron microscopy.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	158	 TRF2 and p53 were incubated with the model telomere DNA.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	159	 p53 was then detected by addition of an anti-p53 polyclonal rabbit IgG followed by incubation with 10-nm gold particles conjugated to protein A.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	160	 There was no cross-reactivity of the antibody with TRF2 as seen by EM and Western blot; hence all labeled molecules must contain p53 (data not shown).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Because p53 is unable to assemble t-loops in the absence of TRF2 and we have previously shown that TRF2 binds all t-loop junctions, the looped molecules must also contain TRF2 (10).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	162	 All t-loop junctions that are labeled with gold particles, therefore, are presumed to contain both p53 and TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	163	By this approach, 100 individual molecules were placed into five classes: protein-free DNA (38%), DNA with a single protein complex bound at the end (23%), DNA with a single protein complex bound along the DNA not at the end (7%), DNA with protein bound at the base of a t-loop (14%), and DNA aggregates held together by a large protein mass (17%).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Each class was further divided into molecules that were gold-labeled (20%) and molecules that remained unlabeled (80%).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In these studies, gold particles were only observed on end-bound molecules, t-loops, and aggregates.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Of the t-loops detected, 86% were labeled with gold particles at the t-loop junction, demonstrating the association of both TRF2 and p53 (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In addition, 43% of the end-bound molecules were tagged with gold labels (Fig.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The labeled end bound complexes may contain both proteins or only p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These results provide direct evidence for the presence of p53 at TRF2-bound t-loop junctions.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The location of p53 binding within the junction, either to the displaced strand or the Holliday junction-like structure, could not be resolved using these methods.

0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	178	In this study we have used purified TRF2, p53, and a model telomere DNA to examine the binding of p53 to telomeric structures including the duplex repeats, the ss overhang, and a t-loop junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	179	 No evidence for preferential binding of p53 to duplex telomeric DNA was observed.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	180	 p53 does bind strongly to the ss overhang, as expected based on previous studies showing that p53 has a high affinity for ss DNA (17).
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	181	 p53 also associates with the t-loop junction with high affinity and was found to cooperate with TRF2 in formation of t-loops on the model telomere template.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This produced a 2-fold increase in the frequency of t-loops as monitored by EM.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	183	 p53 was detected at the t-loop junction in the presence of TRF2 binding, suggesting that both proteins are present in a complex at the t-loop junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	184	It remains possible that the enhancement of TRF2-mediated t-loop formation by p53 results from its interactions with the overhang or junction.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Interactions of p53 with the junction may add stability and prevent t-loop loss in vitro.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	186	 t-Loops could be lost because of migration of the junction along the duplex repeat tract or dissociation of TRF2.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Association with the ss overhang may facilitate localization of TRF2 to the ss/ds overhang, which would result in an increase in loop assembly.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	188	Several biologically significant roles for p53 localization to the t-loop junction can be envisioned.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Normally, p53 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the G1/S transition and is shuttled back to cytoplasm shortly thereafter.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The presence of p53 at the t-loop junction just prior to DNA replication may promote resolution of the junction to facilitate telomere replication.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	191	 It is also possible that p53 is sequestered at the t-loop junction to allow immediate recognition of any loss of end protection by p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Cell cycle arrest or apoptosis then can be triggered.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Additionally, other protein factors may be recruited to the chromosome end through interactions with p53.
0.542364.11859067.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These factors may be essential for telomere structure and function.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In response to DNA damage, signal transduction pathways are activated that result in the increase of p53 protein levels, leading to either growth arrest or apoptosis.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated by tumor-promoting phorbol esters in both mouse skin and cell culture models.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We report here that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate prevents DNA damage-induced up-regulation of p53 by down-regulating PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Regulation of p53 in response to stress most commonly occurs by preventing ubiquitination and degradation of the p53 protein.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Surprisingly, suppression of p53 expression by inhibition of PKC was caused by the inhibition of p53 synthesis, not increased degradation of p53 protein.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Inhibiting PKC blocked both basal transcription of the human p53 gene and initiation of transcription from the human p53 promoter.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Therefore, the tumor-suppressing effects of PKC are mediated at least in part through activating p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in mediating stress and DNA damage-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (1).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The p53 protein regulates normal responses to DNA damage and other forms of genotoxic stress and is a key element in maintaining genomic stability (2).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In fact, the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently inactivated gene in human malignancy (3).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The level of p53 protein is largely undetectable in normal cells but rapidly increases in response to a variety of stress signals.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized is not completely understood, but post-translational modification plays a pivotal role (4).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mutations in the p53 gene are frequently associated with the formation of human cancer; however, the p53 pathway can also be derailed by numerous oncogenic proteins (5).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Mice engineered to have the p53 gene knocked out develop tumors at an increased rate (6).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The critical position p53 plays in tumor suppression suggests that many agents may inhibit the p53 pathway as part of the road toward tumor promotion.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, the mechanisms of action of many chemical agents that promote tumor development have not been elucidated.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	20	 With the central role of p53 in mind, it is logical to presume that agents that promote tumor formation might block the p53 pathway.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	21	The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)1 promotes tumor formation in a variety of mice and tissue culture models, and this has been associated with the down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) (7).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	22	 TPA is known to activate but then down-regulate the diacylglyceroldependent PKC isoforms (7, 8).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We demonstrated that the tumor-promoting activities of TPA are mediated at least in part by down-regulating PKC (9 to 12).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing PKC in their epidermis are resistant to tumor promotion by TPA (13).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Increasing evidence suggests that PKC is a player in DNA damage response pathways.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PKC is activated in the DNA damage response by both tyrosine phosphorylation and cleavage of PKC to a 40-kDa constitutively active catalytic fragment (14, 15).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Furthermore, downregulation of PKC expression by inhibitors and siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	28	Many chemotherapeutic drugs work by inducing cell death via the p53 pathway (17).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Previous studies have suggested that TPA can inhibit the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 (18, 19).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Moreover, other studies with protein kinase inhibitors have suggested that PKC regulates the p53 pathway (20, 21).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In this report, we have examined the effect of PKC on p53 protein and gene expression and report that PKC is required for the basal transcription of the p53 gene.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of TPA in the MCF-7 cells was probably due to the down-regulation of PKC .

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	185	 These data suggest that the ability to suppress p53 accumulation is mediated by the inhibition of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	186	Stabilization of p53 by Proteosome Inhibitors Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Pharmacological Inhibition of PKC  The increase in the level of p53 after DNA damage has been demonstrated to occur at the post-transcriptional level, although some regulation of p53 at the level of transcription has been observed (34 to 36).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The ubiquitin proteosome pathway is involved in the degradation of p53, and after DNA damage the p53 protein is post-translationally modified so that it is no longer targeted for degradation (37).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The levels of p53 can therefore be increased chemically by using inhibitors of the proteosome pathway (4, 38, 39).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	189	 We reasoned that if TPA pretreatment of cells was inhibiting stabilization of p53 through increased degradation of the protein, then chemical inhibition of the proteosome pathway would be able to increase p53 levels even after the cells were pretreated with TPA.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	190	 However, surprisingly, we observed that TPA pretreatment of ML-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of the proteosome inhibitor LLnL to stabilize p53 (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Similarly, rottlerin was also able to prevent p53 accumulation induced by proteosome inhibition (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	192	 4B), implicating a requirement of PKC for synthesis of p53.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Therefore, the inhibitory effect of TPA and PKC inhibition on p53 protein accumulation was apparently not due to enhanced p53 degradation by a proteosome-mediated proteolysis pathway.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	201	  Basal Transcription of p53 Is Blocked by TPA Treatment and Inhibition of PKC  In light of the proteosome inhibition data, it became clear that the ability of TPA to suppress p53 accumulation was not due to destabilization of the protein as is usually the case for down-regulation of p53 (37).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We therefore investigated whether TPA was down-regulating p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	203	 ML-1 cells were treated with TPA for increasing times, and RNA was extracted.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Northern blot analysis using a p53 probe was then carried out.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	205	 A clear reduction in the basal level of p53 transcript was evident with increasing time of TPA pretreatment, beginning after 8 h (Fig.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TPA on p53 was maintained in cells treated with the various DNA-damaging agents (data not shown).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Slightly greater than 50% inhibition of p53 mRNA levels was observed after 8 h of TPA treatment.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Down-regulation of PKC expression by siRNA has been associated with attenuation of the DNA damage-induced response (14, 16).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	210	 We used siPKC as an additional means to confirm the requirement of PKC for the basal transcription of p53 (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	211	 With the siRNA to PKC , we were able to inhibit the level of PKC protein by 38% as determined from the densitometry scanning of Western blot analysis, and the basal p53 message (monitored by quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR) was inhibited by 35%.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Significantly, in addition to TPA, the PKC inhibitor also blocked p53 transcription (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Whereas the proteosome inhibitor LLnL did not affect the level of p53 mRNA, the reduction of p53 mRNA was evident in the presence of LLnL and the PKC inhibitor (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Inhibition of p53 mRNA by rottlerin was also associated with inhibition of transcription of p53 downstream target genes p21 and hdm2 activated in the presence of LLnL treatment (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The conventional PKC inhibitor GO6976 had no effect on the level of either p53 or p21 induced by DNA-damaging agents (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of conventional PKC isoforms does not play a role in the effects of TPA observed here.

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Here we document that the DNA damage-induced increase in p53 accumulation mediated by CPT, MC, etoposide, and zeocin is dramatically inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the tumor promoter TPA.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Additionally, the PKC inhibitor, rottlerin, was also able to block the DNA damage-mediated induction of p53 by these drugs.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Most significantly, we show that pretreatment of cells with TPA or treatment with rottlerin results in the inhibition of basal p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Therefore, accumulation of p53 could not be achieved by any means, including proteosome inhibition, after TPA or rottlerin treatment, because p53 transcription was blocked.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	262	In agreement with previously proposed models, our results support the idea that PKC is involved in a tumor suppressor pathway that involves p53 (19).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Recently a role for PKC in the accumulation of p53 and the induction of apoptosis in bovine endothelial cells has been shown (41).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Additionally, it has been shown previously that the tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 4--phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate transiently down-modulated p53 mRNA levels (42).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Using siRNA to inactivate PKC , we have demonstrated a direct requirement for PKC in controlling basal human p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In addition to demonstrating that TPA treatment does not decrease p53 message stability, we used a dominant negative PKC in co-transfection studies to extend the analysis of PKC inhibition.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This extension examines p53 promoter regulation.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Our results show that the initiation of transcription from the p53 promoter can be blocked by the inhibition of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Whereas our studies do not rule out an additional effect of TPA and PKC down-regulation upon p53 protein stability, they do reveal a novel mechanism for suppressing p53 expression that probably contributes to tumor promotion by phorbol esters.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	270	 In fact, our preliminary data show that TPA can increase the level of Mdm2 protein while the mdm2 mRNA remains constant.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	271	2 This suggests that an additional mechanism is also present to efficiently eliminate any existing p53.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	272	Our results raise several important questions regarding how tumor promoters might regulate the initiation of p53 transcription and suggest a model in which DNA damage in the presence of such tumor promoters could result in malignant transformation (Fig.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Repression of the p53 promoter has been suggested as a mechanism for tumor promotion (34, 43).
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Damaged genes in tumor cells are usually thought to be the mechanistic drivers toward oncogenesis.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	275	 However, down-regulation of endogenous genes, specifically tumor suppressors, may also be a key regulatory mechanism resulting in tumor promotion.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Our data provide a transcriptional repression mechanism for tumor promotion by TPA and predict that agents that interfere with the activity of PKC may inhibit p53 responses.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	277	 We have begun to compare the DNA binding activity of transcription factors known to bind to the p53 promoter in extracts from cells before and after the inactivation of PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Presently, we have not found the DNA binding activity of any transcription factor inhibited and have confirmed the previous finding that NF-B is activated by TPA treatment in most (but not all) of the cell lines tested.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	279	3 Continued promoter studies are in progress to search for either a repressor or activator involved in p53 transcription that may be regulated by PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	280	 One possibility is the Ets-2 protein, because there is a binding site for this protein in the p53 promoter, and PKC regulates the level of Ets-2 protein (44).

0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Inhibition of PKC promotes malignant transformation by the inhibition of basal p53 transcription.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	283	 A, DNA damage activates the pathway to stabilize p53 and thus to initiate growth arrest and apoptosis.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	284	 B, DNA damage, in the presence of inhibition of PKC , is unable to activate the p53 stabilization, because p53 mRNA is reduced, resulting in no p53 protein, and therefore genomic instability and malignant transformation are the result.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	285	Since activating the p53 apoptotic pathway is a checkpoint used by cells to avoid mutations from damaged DNA and is the target of many chemotherapeutic regimes, it is possible that agents with PKC -activating properties may provide synergistic cytotoxic activity.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Conversely, agents that have PKC -inactivating potential may drastically reduce chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In this regard, it is of interest that bryostatin 1, which is in clinical trials for several cancers (45), modulates the activity of PKC isoforms.
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It may be that the antineoplastic properties of bryostatin 1 are due to effects upon PKC .
0.5353734.14699137.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Our findings demonstrate that focusing on the transcriptional regulation of p53 presents a novel targeted approach in the war against cancer and highlights the possibility that agents in the environment may adversely affect the p53 pathway by inhibiting the transcription of tumor suppressor genes.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	3	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   Mdm-2 plays a central role in the regulation of p53 protein level and activity.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Although the interaction of mdm-2 and p53 occurs through the N-terminus of the p53 protein, our present data suggest that the C' terminus plays an important role in the regulation of the p53/mdm-2 loop.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Comparative analysis of the murine regularly spliced form of p53 (RSp53) and a physiological C-terminally modified p53 protein, which results from alternative splicing of the p53 mRNA (ASp53), indicated that the two isoforms behave differently in the p53/mdm-2 loop.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We found that ASp53 can preferentially induce higher levels of the mdm-2 protein, compared with RSp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although the transactivation capacity of both forms is inhibited by mdm-2, only RSp53 is directed to proteolytic degradation by mdm-2, while ASp53 is relatively resistant.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We present evidence that suggests that ASp53 protein levels determine the biological activities mediated by RSp53, such as the induction of apoptosis, through the mdm-2/p53 regulatory loop.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We suggest, therefore, a new mechanism for the regulation of p53, and show that alteration of the p53 extreme C' terminus can significantly change the transcription activity and the resistance to degradation properties of the p53 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	10	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a major role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis and in the prevention of genetically damaged cell proliferation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The most pronounced activity of p53 is its ability to suppress tumor development, which correlates with its capacity to induce apoptosis, to specifically bind DNA and to induce transactivation of down stream genes.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Different stress signals, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, metabolic changes and activated oncogenes were shown to activate wild-type p53 in normal tissues (for review see refs 1 and 2).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	13	One of the main regulators of p53 protein level and activity is the mdm-2 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Mdm-2 was shown to bind p53, inhibit its transactivation capacity and direct it to proteolytic degradation (for review see refs 3 and 4).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Indeed, mdm-2 was shown to target p53 ubiquitination (5) and to function as a ubiquitin ligase (6).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, the mdm-2 gene is one of the p53 target genes whose transcription is induced by p53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Taken together, a negative autoregulatory loop exists between p53 and mdm-2.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This feedback loop is responsible for the maintenance of the basal low levels of p53 in normal conditions.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The inhibitory effect of mdm-2 can be modulated by multiple mechanisms.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These include post-translational modifications, occurring both on p53 and mdm-2 proteins and physical interactions with other cellular proteins, such as p19ARF and c-abl (for review see ref.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	21	Another determinant controlling p53 protein activity and stability is the p53 C' terminus.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The C' terminus of p53 contains a number of structural domains, among which are the oligomerization domain, three nuclear localization signals (NLS) (7) and nuclear export sequences (NES) (8).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It also contains a number of sites for a variety of post-translational modifications, which include phosphorylation (9), acetylation (10), glycosylation (11), poly ADP-ribosylation (12), ubiquitination (13) and sites for proteolytic cleavages (14).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There also exists a remarkable number of binding sites to cellular proteins, such as the TATA-binding protein (TBP) (15), several transcription factor IIH (TFIIH)-associated factors (16), the 14-3-3 proteins (17), BRCA1 (18), the S100B calcium binding protein (19), the Werner syndrome protein (20), Ref-1 (21), telomerase (22) and Sumo-1 (23).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The majority of these modifications and interactions with other cellular proteins are implicated in the regulation of the p53 biological functions.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Indeed, the p53 C' terminus was shown to play a major regulatory role in the ability of p53 to specifically bind DNA (24 to 28), which is one of the hallmarks of wild-type p53, and to be essential for the recognition of and binding to damaged DNA (29,30).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	27	Although mdm-2 binds p53 within its transactivation domain, located at the N-terminus of the protein, several findings suggest that the p53 C' terminus might determine the sensitivity of p53 to proteolytic degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Mutation of lysine residues within the p53 C' terminus resulted in resistance to E6-mediated degradation (31).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Deletion of this domain stabilized the truncated protein (13,32), that resulted in resistance to mdm-2 directed degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, the ubiquitin-like protein, Sumo-1, was shown to bind the p53 C' terminus, on lysine 386, leading to p53 activation (23,33).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The c-abl protein kinase was also shown to directly bind to the extreme C' terminus of p53, which in turn enhanced its transcriptional activity and increased the p53 expression level, through the inhibition of the mdm-2 mediated degradation of p53 (34,35).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	32	The physiological importance of the C' terminus is evident by the existence of a physiological variant of the p53 protein which results from alternative splicing of the murine p53 mRNA (ASp53).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	33	 ASp53 lacks 26 amino acids from the extreme C' terminus of the p53 regularly spliced form (RSp53), and contains instead 17 new and unique amino acids (36).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It consists of 25 to 33% of the total p53 mRNA in the cell (37,38).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Moreover, the ratio between the RSp53 and ASp53 protein levels vary according to the state of the cell (e.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	36	 proliferating or differentiating cell, and depending on the stage of cellular differentiation, and on the cell cycle phase).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Interestingly, differences in the RSp53 and ASp53 pattern of expression were also monitored during tumor development and progression (39), suggesting a strong selection against ASp53 expression during tumor development.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Although the murine ASp53 is relatively abundant, an ambiguity exists regarding the biological role of this spliced variant.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	39	 A significant difference exists between the two physiological p53 variants in their ability to spontaneously bind specific DNA sequences (24 to 26), and in the capacity to catalyse re-annealing of single-stranded RNA or DNA (40).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Moreover, we previously showed that although the two forms are capable of inducing apoptosis when equally expressed in myeloid cells, apoptosis induced by ASp53 is attenuated, in comparison to that induced by RSp53 (41).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Surprisingly, the co-expression of the two forms resulted in the inhibition of RSp53-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a role for p53 mRNA alternative splicing in the determination of p53-induced apoptotic levels (42).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	42	In order to further elucidate the role of the p53 C' terminus in protein stability associated with the mdm-2 degradation regulatory loop, we analysed the relationship between the two p53 alternative spliced forms and the mdm-2 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We found that while RSp53 was more efficient in the induction of transactivation of all of the p53 target genes examined, ASp53 selectively induced a stronger transactivation of mdm-2.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Moreover, although both of the p53 protein forms seem to physically associate with the mdm-2 protein and their transcription activity was inhibited by mdm-2, there was a marked difference in their sensitivity to mdm-2 directed degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	45	 RSp53 protein was sensitive to the proteolytic degradation regulated by mdm-2 while ASp53 protein was relatively resistant.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This suggests that by facilitating the selective degradation of RSp53, ASp53 may modulate the biological functions exerted by RSp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Thus, alternative splicing of p53 mRNA may affect the RSp53 protein stability and activity.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The luciferase activity in each transfection was calculated according to the transfection efficiency, which was determined by the ss-gal activity.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	98	 (B) The induction of mdm-2 expression was analysed by western blotting of the murine stable M1/2-derived clones: p53tsAS-27, which expresses the ASp53 protein, and clone p53tsRS-53, which expresses the RSp53 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	99	 pLXSN p53 null cell line was used as a control.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The cells were transferred to 32 degrees C for different time periods, as indicated in the figure, and then collected and analysed on SDS to PAGE gel.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The expression of mdm-2 was analysed by the pAb-4B2 anti-mdm2 monoclonal antibody.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	102	 p53 protein levels were analysed by the antibody Pab-248 anti p53 monoclonal antibodies.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The expression of -tubulin was analysed, as a control for protein level in each sample, using a monoclonal antibody directed to the -tubulin protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	104	  Interestingly, however, this pattern was different in the case of the mdm-2 promoters.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The mdm-2 gene contains two distinct promoters: an upstream constitutive promoter (P1), whose activity is barely affected by p53, and another promoter (P2), which is located in intron 1 and is p53-dependent (45).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In contrast to all of the other examined promoters, only the transcription level induced by ASp53 from the mdm-2 promoters was shown to be significantly higher than that induced by RSp53 (Figure 1A).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This was mostly pronounced with the P2 p53-dependent promoter, but was also evident with the P1 constitutive promoter (note the differences in the scales of the y-axis) and both of the promoters together (P1 + P2).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	108	In order to validate the relevance of the above findings, we investigated the pattern of mdm-2 protein induction in murine myeloid p53-null M1/2 cells.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Previously we generated and characterized M1/2-derived stable clones which express similar levels of exogenous temperature sensitive (ts) mutants of either RSp53 or ASp53 (41).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For the next experiment we used the stable clones p53tsRS-53, which expressed RSp53, and the stable clone p53tsAS-27, which expressed ASp53, as well as the clone pLXSN, which was infected by an empty virus that serves as a control (41).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	111	 All clones were transferred to 32 degrees C to permit the expression of the wild-type p53 protein conformation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Cells were collected at different time points following the temperature shift, and the protein level of mdm-2 was determined using western blot.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	113	 As can be seen in Figure 1B, a clear induction of mdm-2 was observed in both p53 expressing clones.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Clone pLXSN exhibited a low basal level of mdm-2 protein induction with no significant induction.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It should be noted, however, that induction of the mdm-2 expression was more pronounced in the p53tsAS-27 clone, compared with that in clone p53tsRS-53 (Figure 1B).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Furthermore, in this time period, there was no significant change in the protein level of the p53 protein variants.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Therefore, as can be seen in different and independent experimental systems, ASp53 can up-regulate mdm-2 expression more efficiently than RSp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	118	It should be noted that previously we found by RT to PCR, Northern and western blots that the induction of p53 downstream genes (Waf-1, Cyclin G and Bax) is faster and more efficient by RSp53 as compared with that by ASp53 (41).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These results further support the above findings, which show a selective and preferential induction of mdm-2 by ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	120	A differential sensitivity of RSp53 and ASp53 to mdm-2 directed degradation Previously it was shown that the extreme C-terminus of p53 is required for efficient mdm-2 directed degradation of p53, and that its deletion stabilizes the protein (32).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Since RSp53 and ASp53 differ at their C' terminus, we compared their sensitivity to proteolytic degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	122	 For that purpose we transiently co-transfected murine 174.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	123	2 p53/mdm-2 double knock-out cells, with RSp53 or ASp53 expression plasmids, together or without a wild type mdm-2 expression vector.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In agreement with previous reports (46,47) we found that upon expression of mdm-2 a significant reduction in the RSp53 protein level was evident (Figure 2A).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In contrast, mdm-2 expression did not affect significantly the ASp53 protein levels under the same experimental conditions.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	126	 It should be noted that the mdm-2 protein level is similar in cell transfected with either RSp53 or ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In all transfections, the same level of total protein was analysed (shown by -tubulin antibody staining), and similar efficiencies of transfection were achieved.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	138	2 p53/mdm-2 double knockout cells resulted in similar levels of p53 expression (Figure 2A).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In contrast, transfection of equal amounts of RSp53 or ASp53 coding plasmids into murine K/O p53-null cells, which contain an intact endogenous mdm-2 gene, resulted in a significant difference in the level of expression of the two p53 protein variant forms (Figure 2B).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	140	 It should be noted that RSp53 and ASp53 migrate on SDS to PAGE differently, due to the shortening of ASp53 by 9 amino acids at the p53 C-terminus (36).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The reduced level of RSp53 expression, compared with that of ASp53, could be explained by the induction of the endogenous mdm-2 protein and the relative resistance of ASp53 to the mdm-2 directed degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	142	Although both of the p53 protein variants can equally bind mdm-2 (data not shown) and be translocated to the nucleus (data not shown), RSp53 is more efficiently directed to proteolytic degradation by mdm-2, than ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Therefore, alteration of the extreme C' terminus of p53 (either by deletion of the RSp53 C' terminus, or by the acquisition of a unique and new C' terminus) accounts for the loss of sensitivity of ASp53 to mdm-2 dependent degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	144	RSp53 and ASp53 transcription activity is inhibited by mdm-2 The mdm-2 protein binds p53 at the N-terminal domain and thus inhibits p53-mediated transactivation (48,49).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Since binding of mdm-2 to p53 is required for targeting p53 for degradation and since both of the p53 protein forms share the same N-terminus, we investigated the possibility that mdm-2 inhibits transactivation mediated by RSp53 and ASp53 variants.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Using immuno-precipitation assays following transient transfections of either RSp53 or ASp53 together with mdm-2 coding plasmids, both p53 protein forms were shown to bind mdm-2 (data not shown).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This is in agreement with the observation that only the p53 N-terminus is necessary for mdm-2 binding (48,49).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	148	In order to examine whether these p53 to mdm-2 protein interactions affect the transactivation capacity of RSp53 or ASp53, we transiently co-transfected RSp53 or ASp53 coding plasmids together with an empty vector or with an mdm-2 coding plasmid.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	149	 As can be seen in Figure 3, addition of mdm-2 expression hardly affects the basal transcription level of the RGC and Waf-1 promoters, whereas a marked inhibition of both the RSp53- and ASp53-dependent transcription from both promoters following expression of mdm-2 was apparent.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Following mdm-2 expression, the transactivation capacity of both RSp53 and ASp53 was reduced by 20 to 40%.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The expression of mdm-2 reduced RSp53-dependent RGC transactivation by ~30%, whereas that of ASp53 was reduced by ~40%.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The transactivation of the Waf-1 promoter by ASp53 was reduced by mdm-2 expression to a lesser extent (20%) than that by RSp53 (~30%).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Therefore, it can be concluded that mdm-2 inhibits the transactivation capacities of both p53 protein variants to a similar extent.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	161	  ASp53 inhibits RSp53-induced apoptosis through the induction of mdm-2 Previously we found that ASp53 was less efficient than RSp53 in inducing apoptosis in M1/2 myeloid cells.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Furthermore, co-expression of RSp53 and ASp53 resulted in the inhibition of RSp53-induced apoptosis (42).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This ASp53-dependent inhibition was specific for p53-dependent apoptosis, and was not evident in a p53-independent apoptotic pathway.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Since the M1/2 cells contain an intact mdm-2 gene, we speculated that the ASp53-dependent inhibition of apoptosis might result from the induction of the mdm-2 protein expression by ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This will in turn lead to the preferential degradation of RSp53 (due to the relative resistance of ASp53 to degradation), and thus will eventually attenuate the rate of apoptosis in these cells.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	166	In order to examine this hypothesis we transiently transfected murine p53-null K/O cells with the RSp53 and ASp53 expressing plasmids.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Twenty-eight hours following the transfection the apoptotic patterns of only the transfected cells was analysed by FACS according to the percentage of the sub-G1 fraction of the gated GFP-positive cells.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The transfections were done in duplicate, and the results are presented as an average of the individual experiments.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	169	 As can be seen in Figure 4A, a significant induction of apoptosis by RSp53 was observed.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Co-expression of both of p53 forms resulted in a lower level of apoptosis compared with that induced only by RSp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This is in agreement with the previous observations in stable clones derived from the M1/2 myeloid cells (42), and further confirms that ASp53 expression inhibits the apoptosis induced by RSp53.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	182	  In order to examine whether the preferential induction of mdm-2 is the cause of the inhibition of RSp53-dependent apoptosis observed above, we next co-transfected p53/mdm-2 double knockout 174.

0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	184	 As can be seen in Figure 4B, in these cells RSp53 was again more efficient in inducing apoptosis in comparison with ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In contrast to that observed in the p53 null cells, only in the p53/mdm-2 double knock out cells did the co-expression of ASp53 with RSp53 not result in a decrease of the RSp53-induced apoptosis (Figure 4B).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This may indicate that the inhibitory effect evident in the K/O and M1/2 cells is a result of the endogenous mdm-2 expression.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Furthermore, although the total amount of transfected p53 DNA was equal in the last two transfections, addition of yet higher amounts of RSp53 coding plasmid resulted in an elevation of the apoptotic level, which was even higher than the level of apoptosis induced by the co-expression of RSp53 and ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This observation may suggest that the two p53 protein forms share, at least in part, common mechanisms.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	189	In order to further assess the role of mdm-2 in the inhibition of RSp53-induced apoptosis, we also transiently transfected human non-small cell lung carcinoma H1299, a p53-deficient cell line, with RSp53 and ASp53 coding plasmids.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Seventy-two hours following transfection cells were collected and analysed for their apoptotic patterns (Figure 4C).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Again, RSp53 induced higher levels of apoptosis compared with ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	192	 As with K/O cells, in H1299 cells, co-expression of RSp53 and ASp53 resulted in an attenuation of the RSp53-induced apoptosis.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Expression of higher amounts of RSp53 resulted in a significant enhancement of apoptosis compared with the level of apoptosis induced by the co-expression of RSp53 and ASp53 (although the final amount of transfected p53 coding plasmids is identical).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	194	Another approach for determining the involvement of mdm-2 in the inhibitory effect mediated by ASp53 on RSp53 functions, could be through the abrogation with mdm-2 activity.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Mdm-2 mediated degradation of p53 can be disrupted by the expression of the p19ARF protein [for review see (50)].
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	196	 p19ARF is the product of the murine INK4A tumor suppressor gene, which binds both mdm-2 and p53 and thus abrogates the effects of mdm-2 on p53 protein (51,52).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This is probably through the sequestering of mdm-2 into the nucleolus (53).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In the following experiments we co-transfected the expression plasmids of p53 and p19ARF, which can be detected by western blot analysis (Figure 4D).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	199	 As can be seen in Figure 4C, co-expression of p19ARF with p53 resulted in the enhancement of apoptosis induced by either RSp53 or ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Most notably, p19ARF expression significantly altered the effect of ASp53 on RSp53-induced apoptosis.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Most notably, in the presence of p19ARF, ASp53 synergizes with RSp53 in the induction of apoptosis, similar to the observed phenotype in 174.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	202	2 p53/mdm-2 double knockout cells.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This suggests that the inhibitory effect of ASp53 expression on RSp53-induced apoptosis is mediated mostly through the mdm-2 protein, and that abolishment of mdm-2 activity, either by direct knocking out of the mdm-2 gene, or through interaction with p19ARF, eliminates the inhibitory effect mediated by ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	204	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   p53 is a short lived protein that was shown to be regulated by an mdm-2 dependent degradation pathway.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Mdm-2 is a major component in the molecular mechanism which regulates the biological functions and protein levels of p53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Our present study adds an additional layer of complexity to the known p53/mdm-2 auto-regulatory loop and shows that in addition to the well established mechanisms by which p53 interacts with mdm-2 through its N-terminus, the C-terminus of p53 can also affect the p53/mdm-2 regulatory loop.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We found that while ASp53 can selectively induce higher levels of the mdm-2 protein, compared with RSp53, it is relatively resistant to the mdm-2-directed proteolytic pathway.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Furthermore, RSp53-induced apoptosis was shown to be inhibited by the addition of ASp53 expression, in an mdm-2 dependent manner.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	209	Previously it was shown that p53 mutants which lack their extreme C' terminus can physically associate with mdm-2, but are resistant to mdm-2 directed degradation (32).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In agreement with these results we show here that although the physiological variant of p53, ASp53, can bind mdm-2, and its transactivation capacity is inhibited by mdm-2, as is RSp53, it is resistant to mdm-2 dependent degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The molecular explanation for this selective resistance of ASp53 is still unknown.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This could be the result of the inability of mdm-2 either to ubiquitinate ASp53, or to facilitate its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Indeed, the ubiquitination of C-terminally deleted p53 proteins is markedly reduced (6).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	214	The mechanisms which confer resistance of RSp53 to mdm-2 directed degradation following genotoxic stress were suggested to engage at least two pathways (for review see ref.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The first involves phosphorylation of several sites at the N' terminus of p53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The second includes interactions of either p53 or mdm-2 with other cellular proteins, such as c-abl or p19ARF.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Since it is known that phosphorylation at certain sites of the p53 N-terminus domain are interconnected with modifications at the C' terminus, both of these possibilities might contribute to the enhanced stability of the ASp53 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Indeed, it was previously suggested that a third protein that binds the p53 C' terminus is required for the efficient targeting of p53 to degradation (32).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Several cellular proteins were shown to bind the domain that is absent in the ASp53 protein.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Most notably c-abl, which was shown to affect the proteolytic degradation of p53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Therefore, it could be suggested that p53 degradation is also a function of the protein conformation, which is largely regulated by the p53 C' terminus.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	222	In this study, we have observed differences in the transcriptional activity and selectivity of the p53 protein variants.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although the two forms were shown to have the same DNA binding specificities (54), it is still unclear what is the basis for the preferential induction of mdm-2 expression by ASp53, and how the alteration of only the extreme C' terminus of p53 changes the patterns of transactivation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Since the most pronounced difference between these forms is in their ability to spontaneously bind specific DNA sequences (24 to 26), it is still possible that the p53 variants differ in their binding affinities to the various p53 target sites.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Another possibility is that cellular proteins which bind the p53 C' terminus might dictate the preferential transactivation patterns.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that certain TFIIH associated factors, which were shown to bind the p53 C' terminus (16), could participate in this process.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Interestingly, two classes of p53-responsive elements were shown to exist in the p21 promoter (55).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The binding of p53 to these promoters was shown to be differentially regulated by the addition of PAb-421, which binds to the p53 extreme C' terminus.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	229	 It is possible that the alterations in the p53 molecule following binding of PAb-421 are analogous to C-terminally modified p53 by post-translation modifications, proteolytic cleavages and alternative splicing.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Therefore, it could be suggested that C-terminally altered p53 proteins may exhibit selective affinities for different classes of p53-responsive elements.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	231	Moreover, p53 was shown to require p300 to transactivate mdm-2, while p300 co-transactivation is not required for other p53-inducible genes, such as Bax and p21 (56).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	232	 p300 is known to acetylate the p53 C' terminus (10).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	233	 It could be, therefore, that either the acetylation modification or the interaction with p300 itself might dictate the transactivation selectivities of the p53 protein variants.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	234	Alternative splicing occurs also in the additional p53-family members, such as p73 and p63 (for review see ref.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Both of these p53 related proteins have at least three different isoforms that differ only in their C' terminus (p63, -ss, - and p73, -ss, -).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	236	 These physiological variants possess altered biological activities, and were differentially distributed in various tissues (58,59).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Moreover, the C-terminal domain of p73, which is the most abundant isoform, was shown to be the regulatory domain of the protein, that regulates a variety of biological functions (60,61).
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Most notably, this domain regulates the p73 stability by the proteasome-dependent degradation of p73.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	239	 These observations highlight the similarity in the processes that control the activity of p53 family members.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This further strengthens the importance of the C' terminus of both p53 and p73 as regulatory units, which regulate protein degradation.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	241	 It also substantiates the conclusion that p53 and p73 mRNA alternative splicing is a mechanism for controlling protein stability and activity.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Interestingly, mdm-2 can bind p73 and inhibit its transactivation capability, but it does not direct p73 to degradation (for review see ref.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	243	p53 alternative splicing was shown to be conserved in rodent cells, and as observed in this study, it has a significant role in the regulation of p53 protein stability and activities.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Although a human p53 alternatively spliced form has not yet been found, it is possible that alternative splicing reflects a general feature of p53 C' terminus modifications, which serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism to control the activity of these proteins.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Indeed, a number of studies suggest that there may exist significant species-specific differences in the way p53 is modified and regulated (62,63) (for review see ref.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Since many types of post-translational modifications are known to occur on the p53 C' terminus, it could be suggested that human cells express certain p53 C-terminally modified proteins, which are the analogous forms of the murine ASp53.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	247	In summary, it is possible that the relatively enhanced resistance of ASp53 to mdm-2 mediated protein degradation could serve as a mechanism for the constitutive stabilization of low levels of cellular p53, in the absence of cellular stress signals.
0.57527125.11323398.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Therefore, under normal growth conditions, the rate of the p53 mRNA alternative splicing might be important in determining the level and activity of the p53 protein.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These normal interactions may be disrupted during breast carcinogenesis (Petersen et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	20	 It has been observed that although normal mammary epithelial cells undergo growth arrest in culture in the presence of reconstituted ECM (rECM), breast cancer cells and established breast cancer cell lines fail to exhibit similar growth arrest (Petersen et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Thus, it is hypothesized that interaction with ECM may serve to distinguish the growth patterns of normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	22	The mechanism by which ECM-mediated signal transduction events might result in changes in gene expression is a subject of current investigation.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It has been shown that rECM regulates both biomechanical and biochemical signaling events and conversely that alterations in cell morphology can alter the response of cells to rECM (Folkman and Moscona, 1978; Roskelley et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It is hypothesized that because malignant cells have an altered response to rECM, ECM signaling pathways may utilize tumor suppressor checkpoints critical for cellular organization and polarity (Petersen et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	25	Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors that link ECM to structural and functional components within the cell (Hynes, 1992).
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	26	 There is increasing evidence that integrins are important regulators of normal mammary morphology, since mammary carcinoma cells frequently demonstrate atypical patterns of integrin expression including loss, downregulation, or improper localization (Koukoulis et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the normal mammary gland, the 3/ss1 integrin is expressed at the basal surface of luminal epithelial cells (Koukoulis et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In contrast, invasive breast carcinomas demonstrate weak staining and redistribution of the 3/ss1 integrin.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recently, the 3/ss1 integrin has attracted considerable interest, since its function appears to be versatile.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, the integrin 3/ss1 functions as a cell adhesion receptor for laminin-5 (epiligrin), a major ECM protein present in basement membrane (Xia et al.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Studies in keratinocytes suggest that 3/ss1 plays a critical role in cell spreading and migration and promotes gap junctional communication (Carter et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recently, 3/ss1-integrin has been shown to be involved in the initiation apoptosis (Sato et al.
0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Taken together, these studies illustrate the multifaceted role of 3/ss1-integrin in mediating interactions between ECM and epithelial cells and perhaps in initiating apoptosis.

0.5136099.11673474.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Although there is extensive experimental evidence demonstrating the importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor and in promoting differentiation, little is known about the fate of normal human cells that acutely lose p53 function in the context of rECM regulatory signals.

0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Therefore, it is important to develop novel therapeutic strategies that target mutant p53 in tumors.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We have recently identified a novel mutant p53-reactivating molecule, PRIMA-1 (1).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In this study, we have analyzed sensitivity to PRIMA-1 in human tumor cell lines using available information from the database at NCI.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	125	 We asked to what extent PRIMA-1 would preferentially suppress growth of mutant p53-carrying lines and compared the growth inhibition pattern of PRIMA-1 with that of known anticancer drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	126	Our in silico search among 2000 compounds of the NCI diversity set for compounds that inhibit cell growth in a mutant p53-dependent manner yielded eight compounds that showed higher correlation with mutant p53 expression than PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	127	 However, these compounds did not score in our cellular screening assay (1).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	128	 There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	129	 First, our cellular screening assay was designed to identify compounds that were active in the presence of mutant p53 but inactive in p53 null cells.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Therefore, compounds whose activity correlates with mutant p53 levels may not necessarily score in our assay.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This may also explain why PRIMA-1 did not show the best correlation between sensitivity to treatment and mutant p53 expression levels among the compounds in the diversity set.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	132	Second, we used only one concentration of compounds in our cellular screening, i.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	133	 It is obvious that compounds with GI50 values significantly higher or lower than 25  microM would not score as selective for mutant p53-expressing cells in this screening.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This was apparently the case for NSC321206 and NSC150117 that scored at ranking positions 2 and 3, respectively, in our in silico search but were toxic in a mutant p53-independent manner in our cellular screening (V.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Their average GI50 values were 400-fold (NSC321206) and 15-fold (NSC150117) lower than that for PRIMA.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	136	Third, it is relevant to consider the possibility that mutant p53 levels correlate with cell proliferation rate, as indicated by information in the NCI database.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This is consistent with previous studies showing that some p53 mutants have a growth stimulatory activity (16,17), which might at least in part be due to their ability to induce illegitimate expression of growth promoting genes like c-myc, NF-B, PCNA, and others (18 to 21).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It is conceivable that only some mutant p53 proteins stimulate cell proliferation.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Therefore, the correlation between mutant p53 levels and growth suppression by NSC117281 and other compounds that showed a similar correlation could simply reflect a preferential effect on rapidly dividing cells.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In contrast, sensitivity to PRIMA-1 did not correlate with cell proliferation rate.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This may indicate that PRIMA-1 targets a broader range of p53 mutants than those capable of stimulating cell growth.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	142	We observed a positive correlation between sensitivity to treatment with PRIMA-1 and levels of mutant p53 expression.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This is consistent with our previous study demonstrating that PRIMA-1 reactivates mutant p53 and preferentially kills mutant p53-expressing tumor cells (Bykov et al.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In contrast, our regression analysis of 44 selected anticancer agents showed a negative correlation between levels of mutant p53 and drug sensitivity in most cases.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Only a few compounds showed a positive correlation, although weaker than that for PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	146	 For several compounds growth inhibition of tumor cells correlated positively with cell population doubling time, indicating that cell proliferation rate is a more important factor than p53 status for sensitivity to such drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	147	We did not observe any significant negative correlations between GI50 values and wild-type p53 levels, indicating that overexpression of wild-type p53 renders cells more resistant to many drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	148	 A plausible explanation is that tumor cells accumulate a number of apoptosis-evading genetic changes in order to survive high levels of wild-type p53, resulting in increased drug resistance.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	149	To compare sensitivity to PRIMA-1 with that of known anticancer drugs we selected cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, paclitaxel, and methotrexate which are widely used for cancer therapy.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Of these agents, cisplatin (22) and 5-fluorouracil (8) have been shown to preferentially affect cells carrying wild-type p53.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Only paclitaxel has some specificity towards cells expressing mutant p53 (7).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This unusual property of paclitaxel has made it an important component of frontline and adjuvant treatment in a number of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the clinic today (23).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Our analysis revealed that PRIMA-1 has an overall selectivity for mutant p53-carrying tumor cell lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In this respect PRIMA-1 is superior to paclitaxel, which also has such selectivity, but not for all cancer types studied.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	155	 However, paclitaxel showed a significant selectivity for mutant p53-carrying ovarian and renal carcinoma lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	156	 PRIMA-1 was the only agent that showed a mutant p53-selective effect on lung and colon carcinoma lines.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	157	 This is of importance in view of the fact that p53 mutations occur in almost 60% of lung carcinomas and around 50% of colon carcinomas (6).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	158	 A similar selectivity for mutant p53-expressing lines was observed for melanoma, although only around 10% of melanomas carry p53 mutation (6).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Finally, our analysis showed that 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin preferentially inhibited the growth of lines carrying wild-type p53, in agreement with previous studies (12).
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	160	The database analysis provided several clues as to possible mechanisms of resistance against PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	161	 One obvious mechanism is loss of mutant p53 expression.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In addition, it seems likely that increased expression of the IGF1 receptor or other receptors that mediate survival signalling could raise the apoptotic threshold and thus contribute to resistance.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Common mechanisms for resistance to chemotherapy, such as expression of the MDR gene or other drug efflux pumps (24) could presumably also make cells less sensitive to PRIMA-1.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	164	Our cluster analysis demonstrated that PRIMA-1 does not belong to any of the tight clusters of chemotherapeutic drugs formed in dendrogram.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	165	 PRIMA-1 clustered with purine analogs belonging to the group of DNA antimetabolites.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The clustering of that group was quite loose, indicating different mechanisms of action of drugs within the group.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	167	 PRIMA-1 does not have any structural resemblance to nucleotide analogs that would favor a mechanism of activity similar to thioguanine and thiopurine.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This argues that PRIMA-1 acts by mechanisms different from those of major groups of anticancer agents.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	169	Based on our analyses of information in the NCI database, we conclude that PRIMA-1 has preferential growth inhibitory activity on human tumor cell lines carrying mutant p53.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This distinguishes PRIMA-1 from the commonly used anticancer drugs.
0.51028955.12507923.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our results support the notion that PRIMA-1 or structural analogs of PRIMA-1 may serve as lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer drugs for more efficient treatment of tumors carrying mutant p53.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	5	Although the N-terminal BOX-I domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53 contains the primary docking site for MDM2, previous studies demonstrated that RNA stabilizes the MDM2 p53 complex using a p53 mutant lacking the BOX-I motif.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In vitro assays measuring the specific activity of MDM2 in the ligand-free and RNA-bound state identified a novel MDM2 interaction site in the core domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	7	 As defined using phage-peptide display, the RNA MDM2 isoform exhibited a notable switch in peptide binding specificity, with enhanced affinity for novel peptide sequences in either p53 or small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (snRNP-U) and substantially reduced affinity for the primary p53 binding site in the BOX-I domain.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The consensus binding site for the RNA MDM2 complex within p53 is SGXLLGESXF, which links the S9-S10 -sheets flanking the BOX-IV and BOX-V motifs in the core domain and which is a site of reversible conformational flexibility in p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutation of conserved amino acids in the linker at Ser261 and Leu264, which bridges the S9-S10 -sheets, stimulated p53 activity from reporter templates and increased MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Introducing an Ala19 mutation into the p53F270A protein abolished both RNA MDM2 complex binding and hyper-ubiquitination in vivo, thus indicating that p53F270A protein hyper-ubiquitination depends upon MDM2 binding to its primary site in the BOX-I domain.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Together, these data identify a novel MDM2 binding interface within the S9-S10 -sheet region of p53 that plays a regulatory role in modulating the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in cells.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	14	p53 function as a tumor suppressor is linked to its role as a coordinator of a damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoint pathway whose action prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones by the induction of apoptosis or growth arrest (1).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The biochemical activity of p53 linked with tumor suppression is its function as a sequence-specific DNA binding protein and transcription factor that controls the expression of a large panel of gene products implicated in normal growth control, DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (2).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The stress-regulated transactivation function of p53 is driven by its sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is coordinated by specific protein protein interactions that can in turn be modulated by covalent and non-covalent modifications.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The central core domain of p53 from amino acids 90-295 contains the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (3).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Inactivating mutations in p53 at over 200 different amino acid positions within this core DNA binding domain have been detected in human cancers (4), and the mutation often results in the unfolding and accumulation of p53 protein in the nucleus of the cancer cell (5).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	19	 An oligomerization domain from amino acids 320-356 flanks the conserved core sequence-specific DNA binding domain and is required to assemble p53 into its tetrameric structure (6, 7).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	20	Regulatory domains at the N and C termini of p53 modulate protein protein interactions and DNA protein interactions that affect the rate of p53-dependent transcription (8).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The C terminus of p53 contains a negative regulatory domain whose phosphorylation at Ser315 by cyclin-dependent kinases (9) or acetylation at multiple lysine residues by p300 (10) stimulates the transcription activity of p53 in vivo.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The N-terminal regulatory domain of p53 contains the highly conserved BOX-I domain that directs the binding of p53 to proteins, including the positive effector p300 and the inhibitor MDM2, the balance of which regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Phosphorylation at Ser15, Thr18, and Ser20 can either reduce MDM2 binding (11, 12) or stabilize the p53 p300 transcription complex (13), resulting in a net activation of p53 function.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus, the concerted activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 by post-translational modification of its C-terminal domain and the kinase-dependent stabilization of the p53 p300 complex provide a working model to explain the basic mechanism of how p53-dependent gene expression can be activated.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	25	By contrast to p53 activation reactions, inhibition of p53 activity is less understood but involves an MDM2-dependent pathway that functions in cycling cells to degrade p53 and keep its transcriptional activity relatively low.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	26	 MDM2 protein contains at least four independent functional domains, including: 1) an N-terminal domain that recognizes the BOX-I domain of p53 (14); 2) a central domain that binds to the tumor suppressor protein p14ARF; 3) a putative zinc binding domain (15); and 4) a RING-finger RNA binding domain (16).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The original localization of the primary MDM2 docking site on p53 protein in the N-terminal BOX-I domain was defined using small peptide-mimetics (17), crystallographic analysis (18), and mutational studies (15, 19, 36).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These studies revealed that a highly conserved hydrophobic series of amino acids within the N-terminal region of p53 from amino acids 14-27 interact with a hydrophobic binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of MDM2 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The microinjection of monoclonal antibodies to the p53 binding interface of MDM2 protein can activate p53-dependent expression providing direct evidence that MDM2 is normally a negative regulator of p53 function in vivo (20, 21).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Scaffold proteins fused to the BOX-I domain of p53 can activate p53 function by virtue of binding to MDM2 protein (13, 22), providing additional evidence for the importance of this small BOX-I domain as an independent binding motif that is recognized by MDM2 protein in vivo.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	31	Although MDM2 binding to the p53 tetramer results in polyubiquitination of the C-terminal domain of p53 and subsequent degradation, the BOX-I motif is itself sufficient for targeting a heterologous fusion protein for degradation by MDM2 protein (23).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These latter data identify the minimal polypeptide fragment that can be modified by MDM2-dependent degradation machinery in vivo, but how MDM2 protein interacts with the native p53 tetramer is undefined.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	33	 For example, although the BOX-I motif can promote degradation of a heterologous fusion protein in cells (13, 23), monomeric p53 protein, paradoxically, is not degraded by MDM2 (59) indicating that other determinants in the p53 tetramer regulate MDM2 binding in cells.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A more recent study has shown that MDM2 protein, when complexed to RNA in vitro, can bind to p53 lacking the BOX-I domain, suggesting that RNA can induce a conformational change in MDM2 that directs its binding to a novel site in p53 (25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The purpose of this study was to use a biochemical approach to begin to reconstitute the MDM2 p53 tetramer complex in vitro and determine whether co-factors can modulate the in vitro stability of the MDM2 p53 complex.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We provide direct evidence for a secondary docking site for MDM2 within the core domain of p53 that resides within a conformationally flexible S9-S10 -sheet region flanked by conserved domains BOX-IV and BOX-V.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Mutant forms of p53 that contain single point mutations at conserved amino acids within this S9-S10 -sheet region have increased levels of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This conformationally flexible motif is interestingly constrained in the wild-type p53 protein DNA complex (3), but the S9-S10 -sheet region is unfolded or denatured in mutant p53 protein within human cancers (5, 35).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The denaturation or unfolding of p53 protein defined the first molecular defect of the p53 pathway in human cancer cells, and the refolding of p53 protein by small molecules has been the subject of recent screening programs aimed at reactivating mutant p53 protein function (60-62).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Together, these data, identifying the conformationally flexible linker within the S9-S10 -sheet region of p53 protein as a novel MDM2 binding interface, suggest an interplay may exist between p53 protein unfolding and factors that modulate the rate of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 in vivo.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Although MDM2 protein is known to bind to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, a recent study has shown that RNA binding by MDM2 can promote MDM2 protein interaction with a BOX-I deletion mutant of p53 protein using surface plasmon resonance (25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	95	 These latter data suggest that RNA induces a conformational change in MDM2 protein via the RING finger domain and that this promotes an interaction with p53 outside the canonical BOX-I motif.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This current study was set up initially to determine in fact whether ligand binding to the C-terminal domain of MDM2 could change its conformation and whether this change directs MDM2 to interact with a previously unidentified motif within the core domain of p53.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The SGNLLGRNSF motif can be divided into two regions: 1) the SGXL motif is contained in the loop that bridges the S9 and S10 -sheets (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In particular, three missense mutants were constructed: two with amino acids that fit the consensus between p53, snRNP-U, and pRb in the S9-S10 linker loop (Ser261 and Leu264) and a remaining one with an invariant amino acid in the SGNLLGRNSF consensus motif that extends into the S10 -sheet (Phe270).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Mutating the amino acids that are not in the surface loop may inactivate p53 (in fact mutation of Phe270 does impair p53 activity, see below), so the two surface loop mutants (alanine substitutions at Ser261 or at Leu264) were the first constructed that presumably will have little affect on the internal structure and activity of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Alanine substitutions are generally thought to be more subtle than charged or aromatic residues, however, even single alanine substitutions in a reactive motif can either reduce or stimulate a protein protein interaction (58).

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	318	 These data suggest that some protein protein interactions have evolved to maintain a lower affinity, but allowing reversibility in binding, and that binding affinity can be improved artificially.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Such an improvement has been reported with the MDM2 p53 BOX-I complex, where mutation has led to the improvement on MDM2 peptide binding affinity by many orders of magnitude (22, 34).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	320	We subsequently investigated whether the hyper-ubiquitination of p53F270A mutant protein was MDM2-depenent in vivo by examining the levels of ubiquitination using the p53F19A/F270A double mutant (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	327	 It is interesting, therefore, that wild-type p53 requires transfected MDM2 to catalyze its ubiquitination, whereas the p53F270A protein can rely on very small levels of endogenous MDM2 for its ubiquitination.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Because MDM2 binds with a high affinity to 28 S rRNA (55), which is present in reticulocyte lysates, the lysate was treated after p53 protein synthesis with RNase, and this destabilized the MDM2 p53F270A mutant protein complex (Fig.

0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	366	 In panels A, B, and C, the asterisk identifies ubiquitinated p53, which has a short half-life in MDM2-transfected cells upon the addition of cycloheximide, and the arrows point to full-length, un-ubiquitinated, and stable p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	367	Three major points will be discussed.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	368	 First, transfection of wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	369	 13A) induces endogenous MDM2 protein accumulation (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	370	 13D, lane 1) and the addition of cycloheximide results in rapid degradation of the endogenous MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	371	 This endogenous MDM2 protein appears incapable of promoting the ubiquitination of transfected wild-type p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	372	 The transfected MDM2 results in ubiquitination of wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	373	 13A, lane 8 versus lane 1) and the addition of cycloheximide results in the degradation of the ubiquitinated p53 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	374	 13A, lanes 9-14) that mirrors the degradation of transfected MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	375	 The non-ubiquitinated p53 protein is not apparently degraded under these conditions (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	376	 13A, lanes 9-14), consistent with the fact that ubiquitination is required to target po53 for degradation.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Thus, the MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 by the transfected MDM2 gene is rate-limiting and dependent upon the half-life of MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	378	Second, transfection of the p53F270A mutant protein resulting in its hyper-ubiquitination (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	379	 13B, lane 1) only marginally induces endogenous MDM2 protein accumulation (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	380	 13E, lane 1), consistent with its lower specific activity in reporter assays (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	381	 However, the addition of cycloheximide does not result in the rapid degradation of hyper-ubiquitinated-p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	382	 13B, lanes 2-7) under conditions where the endogenous MDM2 was degraded (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	383	 By contrast, the co-transfection of MDM2 with the p53F270A mutant switched the ubiquitination pattern of the p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	384	 13B, lane 8 versus lane 1), and the addition of cycloheximide resulted in degradation of the ubiquitinated p53F270A mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	385	 13B, lanes 9-14) that mirrored the degradation of transfected MDM2 protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Additionally, the very high molecular species of p53F270A that actually increase in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	387	 13B, lanes 2-7 versus lane 1) were absent after transfection of MDM2 (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	388	 These data indicate that the ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein is being carried by a distinct mechanism in the presence of transfected or endogenous MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Consistent with this, the use of His-tagged ubiquitin in a transfection assay does not yield any hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein (data not shown), suggesting that endogenous pools of ubiquitin are specifically recruited onto the p53F270A mutant protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	390	Lastly, despite the fact that the ubiquitinated p53F270A mutant protein has a relatively long half-life (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	391	 13B, lanes 2-7) under conditions where MDM2 is not transfected), the reaction appears MDM2-dependent, because the addition of the Ala19 mutation into the p53F270A mutant protein prevents its hyper-ubiquitination (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Furthermore, the addition of cycloheximide does not alter the immunoreactive p53F19A/F270A double-mutant protein bands that remain (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	393	 13C, lanes 2-7 versus lane 1) nor can MDM2 promote the ubiquitination of the p53F19A/F270A double-mutant protein (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	394	 13C, lanes 8-14) under conditions where transfected MDM2 has the same half-life as in other transfections (Fig.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Together, these data indicate that the hyper-ubiquitination of the p53F270A mutant protein is MDM2-dependent, but because the half-life of the ubiquitinated p53F270A mutant protein is different depending upon whether endogenous or exogenous MDM2 is present, these data point to a novel assay to dissect out physiologically relevant regulatory steps that affect the rate of rate of p53-ubiquitination by MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	396	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	397	P53 protein is a conformationally dynamic allosterically regulated homo-tetramer that has multiple binding sites for regulatory protein co-factors.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	398	 As such, p53 protein forms that basis for a model oligomeric protein that can give insights into basic mechanisms of protein self-assembly, protein kinase function, transcription, and polyubiquitination mechanisms.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	399	 P53 protein contains independent sub-domains that direct sequence-specific DNA binding, nonspecific DNA binding, MDM2 or p300 binding, protein kinase binding, and homo-tetramerization.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	400	 When each domain is linked to the full-length protein, intradomain or allosteric regulation of p53-dependent activity can be observed.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	401	 For example, the polyproline domain in the N terminus of p53 negatively regulates MDM2 protein binding (29), whereas both the C- and N-terminal domains of p53 can regulate allosterically sequence-specific DNA binding (8, 37-40).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	402	MDM2 protein negatively regulates the tumor suppressor activity of p53 by a variety of overlapping mechanisms.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	403	 The binding of MDM2 to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 can block p53-dependent transcription through steric mechanisms (41, 42).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	404	 MDM2 protein also normally promotes the polyubiquitination of p53 (43, 44), by which mechanism MDM2 can modulate the steady-state levels of p53 protein.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	405	 For example, under some conditions, the ubiquitination is associated with rapid degradation of p53 (45).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	406	 However, polyubiquitination of endogenous p53 also increases after certain types of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts, indicating that ubiquitin modification does not always trigger the immediate turnover of p53 (46).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	407	 Nevertheless, the control of p53's degradation can involve the cytoplasmic transport of p53 protein by MDM2 where p53 is degraded by the proteasome pathway.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	408	 By contrast to the inhibitory affects of MDM2 on p53 protein levels, MDM2 protein can stimulate TAFII250-dependent expression from the cyclin A promoter indicating that MDM2 protein binding has distinct affects on different pathways (47, 48) and MDM2 can modulate E2F-dependent activity (64).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	409	The regulation of MDM2 and p53 polypeptide function has been facilitated historically by first dissecting the proteins into individual functional domains.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	410	 MDM2 protein contains several independent subdomains that either bind to the N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53, to the N terminus of the tumor suppressor p14ARF, to zinc, or to RNA.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	411	 This current study addresses the intradomain or allosteric regulation of full-length MDM2 protein and evidence that ligand binding by MDM2 protein switches its affinity and/or specificity from the BOX-I domain of p53 to the conformationally responsive loop flanked by the BOX-IV and BOX-V domains.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	412	 Three pieces of biochemical data have suggested previously that the MDM2 protein interface with tetrameric forms of p53 involves determinants outside the primary N-terminal BOX-I domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	413	 The first was the observation that MDM2 does not bind to mutant forms of p53 with an altered core domain conformation (25, 49).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The second being the observation that full-length MDM2 protein does not bind to p53 DNA complexes in vitro, whereas the truncated N-terminal domain of MDM2 can bind stably to such p53 DNA complexes (18, 25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	415	 The final being the observation that MDM2 RNA complexes can bind to p53 protein lacking the N-terminal BOX-I domain (25).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	416	 The determinants within the p53 tetramer that modulate MDM2 protein binding to the BOX-I domain or that stabilize MDM2 protein binding to sites outside the BOX-I domain were undefined prior to the studies described in this report.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	417	The first protein that was shown to bind to p53 was the SV40 T-antigen (50, 51), although details about the structure of this complex are lacking.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	418	 This interaction results in the inactivation of p53 function, and the binding occurs within the central domain of the p53 tetramer.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Point mutations that unfold the p53 tetramer destabilize the p53 T-antigen complex suggesting a non-linear binding interaction exists between the two proteins (52).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Additionally, classically purified T-antigen does not bind to p53 tetramers unless T-antigen is reconstituted with metal ions like zinc (53).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	421	 The purification of T-antigen results in the loss of the activating metal ion and the re-binding of zinc induces a pronounced conformational change in T-antigen that restores its binding interface with p53 (53).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	422	 A cellular protein that shares similar features to viral T-antigen is the p53 binding protein BP2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	423	 This latter protein was identified in a yeast-two hybrid screen that attempted to define cellular proteins that interact with wild-type but not mutant forms of p53 (54).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Like T-antigen, BP2 interacts with p53 in the central domain and certain classes of mutations that can disrupt the p53 tetramer prevent stable binding of BP2 (52).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Thus, T-antigen and BP2 proteins form the precedent for polypeptides that interact in a relatively complex and dynamic fashion within the central domain of the folded p53 tetramer.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	426	 MDM2 protein interaction with p53 appears to be similarly sensitive to conformational effects.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	427	MDM2 protein is composed of at least four independent functional domains that in isolation bind to RNA, zinc, ARF14, and the BOX-I domain of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	428	 We have set out in this report to develop a quantitative biochemical assay that can be used to begin to dissect interdomain or allosteric communication between these domains of MDM2.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Three highlights are as follows: 1) MDM2 protein changes its conformation when bound to RNA; 2) this conformational change reduces MDM2 affinity with the primary peptide binding site in the N-terminal domain of p53; 3) this conformational change switches its specificity for a distinct peptide motif in the core domain of p53, pRb, and RNP-U.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	430	 To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a protein in a ligand-free and ligand-bound state switching specificity for a target protein and underscores the dynamic nature of MDM2 protein conformation control.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	431	 It is not yet clear how ligand binding by MDM2 into possible permutations (i.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	432	 MDM2 p14ARF, MDM2 RNA, MDM2 zinc, MDM2 RNA/zinc, etc.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	433	) is modulated in cells due to the difficulty in quantitating such MDM2 ligand complexes in living cells.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	434	 As such it is not yet clear how RNA binding to MDM2 will regulate p53 protein transactivation, polyubiquitination, nuclear export, or degradation.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	435	 However, these data demonstrate the dynamic nature of a hetero-oligomeric protein protein interaction where multiple ligand binding sites can direct the docking site specificity and identify an important MDM2 ligand to study for further insights in the p53 pathway.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	436	 For example, although the homopolyribonucleotide polyrG was used as the RNA ligand that binds MDM2, the steady-state levels and accessibility of classes of cellular RNA that can bind to MDM2, like L5 ribosomal protein and its associated 5 S ribosomal RNA (16) or 28 S ribosomal RNA (55), will presumably regulate the pools of MDM2 in a cell that prefer to bind to the BOX-1 domain of p53 or to the S9-S10 linker region of p53.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	437	 In addition, because the RNA binding RING finger domain is required for p53 transport, the MDM2 28 S RNA complex may, for example, be an important mediator of p53 regulation in vivo (55).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Degradation of 28 S rRNA occurs during apoptosis in vivo (56).
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	439	 If this degradation destabilizes the MDM2 RNA complex, this may reduce the ability of MDM2 to bind to and inhibit the activity of p53 protein, thus freeing p53 to induce cell death.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Our initial data suggest that a significant pool of MDM2 RNA complexes may exist in vivo, based on the observation that the S9-S10 linker mutant p53 proteins are expressed at higher steady-state levels than wild-type p53 protein (data not shown) and that they exhibit increases in MDM2-dependent ubiquitination in cells (Figs.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	441	 More quantitative cell-based assays may reveal subtle changes in the levels of wild-type p53 and the S9-S10 linker p53 protein mutants, providing an indirect measure of the MDM2 RNA isoform and ligand-free forms of MDM2 in cells.
0.5138107.11925449.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Because the RNA-bound form of MDM2 reveals a new peptide binding motif that is present in other proteins like snRNP-U, a protein complex involved in the assembly and/or export of ribosomal RNA particles (57), these data suggest first that the amount of RNA complexed to MDM2 may modulate the stability of other cellular proteins and second that therapeutic agents may be developed that discriminate between the ligand-free and RNA-bound forms of MDM2.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, October 1, 2003 , and in revised form, October 22, 2003.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in melanoma tumor cells was recently shown to correlate strongly with poor patient survival after combination biochemotherapy (p  <  0.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, evidence suggests that nitric oxide, a reaction product of nitricoxide synthase, exhibits antiapoptotic activity in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Strikingly, we observed that the depletion of nitric oxide inhibits cisplatin-induced wild type p53 accumulation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	11	 When cisplatin-induced p53 binding to the p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 promoter was examined, it was found that nitric oxide depletion significantly reduced the presence of p53-DNA complexes after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Together, these data strongly suggest that endogenously produced nitric oxide is required for cisplatin-induced p53 activation and p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 expression, which can regulate melanoma sensitivity to cisplatin.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and exhibits extremely aggressive growth characteristics.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The prognosis for patients with disseminated disease is invariably very poor.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Melanoma is highly resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and therapies for melanoma have generally been ineffective at best and rarely result in sustained responses.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Resistance of cancer to therapy is attributable in part to mechanisms such as altered drug uptake or transport, intracellular detoxification, altered DNA repair, and the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway (1).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	18	The tumor suppressor p53 is a sensor of diverse cellular stresses including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, and helps to direct cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at least in part through transcriptional activation of target genes like p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 (p21),1 GADD45, 14-3-3, and bax (2).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Not surprisingly, p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in a broad spectrum of cancers, and its inactivation is frequently associated with tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, the p53 gene is rarely mutated in melanoma (3), and increased expression is associated with tumor progression (4).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Results from several studies suggest that the p53 pathway is dysregulated in melanoma cells, which in turn may lead to inactivation or alteration of p53 function (5).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For instance, many human melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 showed abnormalities in the p53 pathway in response to -irradiation (6).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In recent years, studies have suggested that the retention of wild type p53 may actually confer resistance to therapy in a number of tumor systems (7).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, the role of p53 function in melanoma remains unclear.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	25	Activated p53 can bind to p53-responsive elements in the promoter of the potent cell-cycle regulator p21 and induce its expression (8).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	26	 When sufficiently expressed, p21 induces G1 arrest by direct binding of cyclin-dependent kinases (9).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Expression of p21 has been implicated as a survival mechanism against therapy (10).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	28	 For instance, inhibition of p21 by antisense technology sensitized glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents (11) and to radiation therapy (12).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	29	 p21 also appears to protect human colon carcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells against apoptosis (13, 14).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Additionally, there is evidence that p21 may protect against p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells (15).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The precise involvement of p21 in the resistance of melanoma to therapy remains largely undefined.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	32	Nitric oxide (NO) has recently been implicated in the regulation of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Specifically, treating cells with NO donors resulted in conformational and functional changes and possible tyrosine nitration of p53 protein (16, 17).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition, it was shown that NO can regulate the ability of p53 to stimulate radiation-induced cell cycle arrest in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (18).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	35	 NO is generated as a reaction product of the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by three isotypes of NO synthase (NOS): endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	36	 NOSs are expressed in various tissue types.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	37	 eNOS and nNOS are typically considered to be constitutively expressed, whereas iNOS, as its name implies, is inducible (19).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	38	 NO is involved in neurotransmission, vasodilation, inflammation, and immunity (20) and is also believed to play roles in multiple stages of various cancers (21).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	39	 It exhibits both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic characteristics, depending on concentration and cell type (22, 23).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Recently, NO has been shown to covalently modify proteins that can lead to regulation of activity, including caspases (24, 25), retinoblastoma protein (26), c-Src (27), and p53 (17).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	41	Our laboratory observed that the expression of iNOS and the presence of nitrotyrosine in tumor cells of melanoma patients correlated strongly with poor patient outcome (p  <  0.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	42	02, respectively) (28), suggesting an important role for NO in melanoma resistance to therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Presently, samples from 103 patients with stage III and 36 patients with stage IV melanoma have been analyzed, and similar results have been obtained.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	44	2 Others have correlated NOS activity and iNOS expression with melanoma progression (29).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (30) provided evidence that endogenous NO may serve as a survival factor in human melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	46	Using human melanoma cell lines and cisplatin as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that NO regulates p53 signaling and is required in melanoma resistance to chemotherapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We present evidence that the depletion of endogenous NO in melanoma cell lines leads to increased sensitivity to cisplatin as a consequence of the inhibition of cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation and p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Our findings support the hypothesis that NO is required for DNA damage-induced p53 activation, which acts as a protective factor against apoptosis in melanoma cells.

0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In this study, we demonstrated that the depletion of endogenously generated NO in melanoma cell lines containing wild type p53 decreases cell growth, enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and inhibits p53 accumulation and the subsequent induction of p21 by cisplatin.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Moreover, we showed that the increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells is caused by NO regulation of p53 expression, which exhibits a protective role against cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These findings are consistent with the clinical observation that patients with iNOS-expressing melanomas had significantly poorer survival than their iNOS-negative counterparts.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In addition, the findings that iNOS is up-regulated and overall NOS activity is increased in melanoma further suggest a role for NO (29, 39).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	276	Titration of the NO donor DETA illustrates the dichotomous role of NO in the regulation of proliferation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Addition of 50  microM DETA led to an increase in proliferation, whereas higher levels of DETA ( > 150  microM) markedly inhibited proliferation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	278	 It is now generally accepted that high levels of NO are toxic, whereas lower levels of NO may be growth promoting (reviewed in Refs.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	279	 40 and 41), although the threshold between low and high levels of NO is still dependent on the cell type and context within which NO is found.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	280	Our initial observations that NO depletion and cisplatin treatment resulted in reduced proliferation in melanoma cells led us to evaluate whether the effect was attributable to apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	281	 A number of groups have reported both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic properties of NO, depending on cell type and experimental system (22, 23, 42 to 45).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	282	 We observed that NO depletion by c-PTIO or oxymyoglobin treatment was capable of enhancing cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	283	 However, when NOS inhibitors, including L-NMMA, AMG, and 1400W, were used to block NO production in melanoma cells, they were only minimally effective in enhancing apoptosis after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	284	 (30) found that serum completely suppresses the apoptotic effect of AMG in melanoma cells, so it is possible that serum components interfere with NOS inhibitor activity or complicate its chemistry.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Albumin can act as a NO reservoir, and may control NO-dependent processes in the vasculature (46).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Various thiol containing proteins and low molecular weight thiols such as glutathione may also act as a NO store and selectively release NO to maintain cellular NO levels (47).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Use of a chemical NO scavenger would nullify NO stores by quickly reacting with any newly released NO, whereas inhibition of NO production by NOS does not deplete possible cellular NO storage mechanisms.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Another possibility is that c-PTIO possesses some secondary reactivity (48).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, the lack of effect of quenched NO scavenger controls and the similar effects of oxymyoglobin on melanoma cells strongly suggest that NO is the causal agent in our observations.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	290	Analysis of cell cycle alterations showed that NO depletion by c-PTIO resulted in significant G2 arrest in A375 melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This sustained G2 arrest was subsequently accompanied by an increase in apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Cell cycle alterations were also shown to result from NO depletion in pulmonary cells (49).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The precise involvement of NO in cell cycle regulation is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	294	 However, a number of cell cycle regulators appear to be targets of NO, the most prominent of which is retinoblastoma protein (26).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Accumulation of melanoma cells at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment and a trend toward the return to a normal cell cycle distribution after 36 h suggest that melanoma cells are capable of responding to and possibly repairing DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Our data suggest that p53 response to DNA damage is at least partially intact, as evidenced by the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of p53 after cisplatin treatment and by the subsequent expression of p21.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	297	 NO-depleted melanoma cells did not accumulate at the G1/S boundary after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Instead, cells slowly progressed to the S and G2/M phases, which may be explained by the concomitant loss of cisplatin-induced p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	299	We found that NO depletion in melanoma cells led to reduced p53 accumulation and activation after cisplatin treatment in all melanoma cell lines tested.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	300	 NO depletion also reduced overexpression of mutated p53 in MeWo melanoma cells, which suggests that NO can regulate both wild type and mutant p53 (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In SK-MEL-1 melanoma cells, which exhibit altered p53 and p21 regulation, NO depletion with c-PTIO inhibited basal p21 overexpression and cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	302	 These data suggest that NO may regulate p53 and p21 regardless of their functional or mutational status.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	303	p53 and iNOS were shown to participate in a negative regulatory loop (50).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Specifically, NO was able to activate p53, which in turn inhibited iNOS expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	305	 This observation led to the suggestion that in tumors expressing NOS, there may be a selective pressure to acquire p53 mutations (51).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	306	 This appears not to be the case in melanoma, in which iNOS is upregulated and p53 mutations are rare.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The precise mechanism through which NO modulates the p53 signal transduction pathway remains to be clarified.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Our data suggest that NO is required for proper stabilization and activation of p53 protein, which may exert a protective role against therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	309	NO is likely to interact directly with p53 or regulate signaling components upstream of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	310	 In MCF-7 cells, NO donor treatment resulted in possible tyrosine nitration of p53 and improved DNA binding at low donor levels (0.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	311	5 mM), but inhibited DNA binding at higher donor concentrations (1 to 5 mM) (16), which alludes to some possibly complex interaction between p53 and NO.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Superoxide, known to be up-regulated in melanoma (52), reacts quickly with NO to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidizing agent capable of nitrating tyrosines (53).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	313	 A recent study that focused on the influence of superoxide on nitrosylation reactions may add insight to the exquisite edge on which NO is balanced (32).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	314	 NO may also regulate phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA damage (55, 56).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In addition, cysteines present in the zinc finger DNA binding motifs of p53 may be susceptible to nitrosylation by NO, leading to alterations in p53 function.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	316	Recently, NO was shown to inhibit Hdm2-p53 binding (57).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Hdm2 (Mdm2 in mouse) binds p53 to inhibit its transcriptional activity, ubiquitinates p53 to regulate its stability, and plays a pivotal role in determining p53 localization.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Nitrosylation of cysteine 77 in the hydrophobic p53-binding pocket of Hdm2 is thought to interfere with p53 binding.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Hdm2 has also been found to be up-regulated in some melanoma cells containing wild type p53 (58).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	320	 These findings suggest that NO is involved in the regulation of p53 stability, which may help to explain how the depletion of endogenous NO inhibits cisplatin-induced p53 accumulation in melanoma cells.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Whether endogenous NO inhibits Hdm2-p53 interaction in melanoma cells remains to be determined.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	322	 NO may regulate the activity of p53 upstream effectors such as ataxia telangectasia mutant kinase, AT-mutated and Rad3-related kinase, and DNA-PK.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	323	 For example, NO was shown to activate DNA-PKc to protect against DNA damage (59).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Whether NO regulates the activity of these DNA damage-activated kinases in melanoma cells is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	325	We found that NO depletion, in addition to inhibiting p53 induction, strongly inhibited the cisplatin-induced expression of p21, a downstream target of p53.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	326	 NO is capable of activating p21 via p53 or cGMP pathways (60, 61).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	327	 We observed that inhibition of p21 expression by NO depletion consistently correlated with reduced p53 accumulation.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	328	 NO depletion resulted in the near abrogation of p53 binding to the p53-binding site of the p21 promoter.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Inhibition of p53 by siRNA or dominant negative p53 expression also reduced p21 expression.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	330	 p53 and p21 expression, cell cycle distribution, and the level of apoptosis after cisplatin treatment were not altered by either ODQ or 8-bromo-cGMP.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Furthermore, melanoma cells frequently do not express the NO-sensitive isoform of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which responds to NO to generate cGMP and subsequently induce p21 expression (62).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Taken together, these data strongly suggests that p21 is activated in a p53-dependent manner in melanoma cells with wild type p53 and that the cGMP signaling pathway is not involved.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Whether p21 is a direct target for modification by NO or its derivatives is not known.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	334	Numerous studies have highlighted the ability of p21 to protect glioblastomas, gliomas, colon carcinomas, prostate cancer (14), and melanomas from apoptosis-inducing stimuli.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	335	 p21 was also found to be overexpressed and is rarely mutated in melanoma (54, 63).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Our data show that p53 and p21 are upregulated in melanoma in response to DNA damage by cisplatin, which suggests that melanoma cells actively respond to genotoxic insult by inducing cell cycle arrest and possibly carrying out DNA repair, thus avoiding cell death.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Transfection of a dominant negative form of p53 into A375 melanoma cells resulted in a substantial increase in cisplatin sensitivity as well as a reduction of p21 expression after cisplatin treatment, confirming that p53 activation following exposure to cisplatin protects melanoma cells from apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Inhibition of p53 by siRNA only partially reduced cisplatin-induced p53 and p21 expression, which was not sufficient to enhance apoptosis after cisplatin treatment.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Transfection of mutated p53 into melanoma cells has a dominant effect, which is not the case in siRNA transfection.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Cells transfected with siRNA may still produce low levels of wild type p53, and thus could still be capable of responding to DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Indeed, we observed that p53 siRNA-transfected cells still expressed p21, albeit at a lower concentration (data not shown).
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	342	Based on our data we present a model for the mechanism of melanoma resistance to cisplatin treatment (Fig.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	343	 In this model, NO is a key factor in the p53-dependent activation of p21 expression after cisplatin-induced DNA damage.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Expression of p21 results in a skewing of cellular response toward cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and cell survival, and away from apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Inhibition of p21 can result in the loss of G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and can lead to the induction of apoptosis.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Therefore, the regulation of its expression by NO via the p53 signaling pathway may be of extreme importance in melanoma resistance to therapy.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In this case, the ability of p53 to induce p21 would determine whether tumor cells are protected against genotoxic insult.
0.49328405.14576150.html.plaintext.txt	348	 These insights offer several potential pathways to target for future therapies against melanomas containing wild type p53.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	3	Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is controlled by heat shock transcription factors (HSFs).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Vertebrates express multiple HSFs whose activities may be regulated by distinct signals.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	5	 HSF3 is specifically activated in unstressed proliferating cells by direct binding to the c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb), which plays an important role in cellular proliferation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This suggests that the c-Myb-induced HSF3 activation may contribute to the growth-regulated expression of HSPs.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we report that the p53 tumor suppressor protein directly binds to HSF3 and blocks the interaction between c-Myb and HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, p53 stimulates the degradation of c-Myb through a proteasome-dependent mechanism, which is, at least partly, mediated by induction of Siah in certain types of cells.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Induction of p53 by a genotoxic reagent in DT40 cells disrupts the HSF3-c-Myb interaction and down-regulates the expression of certain HSPs.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Mutated forms of p53 found in certain tumors did not inhibit c-Myb-induced HSF3 activation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The regulation of HSF3 activity by c-Myb and p53 sheds light on the molecular events that govern HSP expression during cellular proliferation and apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	12	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	13	Many heat shock proteins (HSPs)1 remain essential even under nonstressful conditions, a fact that is consistent with their established role in protein folding and translocation (for review see Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The transcription of HSP genes is not only induced by various stresses (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	15	 1) but is also growth-regulated (2).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This is consistent with the view that actively proliferating cells, which express various proteins to high levels, require more HSPs than nonproliferating cells.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HSPs also play a role in the regulation of apoptosis, because overexpression of HSPs is known to block apoptosis (3, 4).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Therefore, HSP expression might be modulated during apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, the mechanism through which HSP expression is linked to cellular growth or apoptosis remains unknown.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	20	In response to stress, heat shock factors (HSFs) bind to heat shock element (HSE) and mediates transcriptional induction of HSP genes (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	21	 HSF activation is regulated in a number of steps.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Upon heat shock, a cryptic form of an inactive HSF1 monomer is converted to a DNA-binding trimer via the hydrophobic repeat (HR-A/B) located in the central region of HSF1 molecule (6, 7).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The C-terminal hydrophobic repeat (HR-C) was suggested to function in suppression of trimer formation by interacting with HR-A/B (8, 9).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Some HSPs such as Hsp90 and Hsp70 bind to HSF1 and maintain it in the inactive state in the absence of stress (10, 11).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Heat shock stress not only regulates the DNA binding activity of HSF1 but also regulates its trans-activating capacity.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The activity of the transcriptional activation domain is negatively modulated by other cis-regulatory domains and by phosphorylation (12, 13).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition to HSF1, vertebrates express multiple HSFs (14-18), suggesting that they are regulated by a diverse array of environmental and developmental cues.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	28	 HSF1 and HSF3 are activated by heat shock at different temperature (19), but heat shock does not significantly affect the activity of HSF2 (20).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) directly binds to HSF3 via the DNA-binding domain of both proteins and induces activation of HSF3 (21).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although c-Myb is a transcriptional activator that binds to the specific DNA sequence, 5'-AACNG-3' (22, 23), it activates HSF3 by a protein-protein interaction.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	31	 c-Myb is induced at G1/S transition in the cell cycle and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These facts suggest that HSF3 activation mediated by c-Myb may contribute to the growth-regulated expression of HSP genes.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although a lot of evidence indicates that HSF1 is activated by heat stress, disruption of the HSF3 gene also results in a reduction in HSP gene expression in response to heat stress (25).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This suggests that HSF3 is also involved in the transcriptional induction of HSP genes following heat stress.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, little is known about how HSF3 regulates heat stress-induced transcription.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, HSF3 acts both in Myb- and heat shock-mediated HSP induction.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	37	The products of proto-oncogenes such as c-Myb activate cellular proliferation, whereas the products of tumor suppressor genes have an opposite effect.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The p53 protein is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor to be identified so far in a wide range of human tumors (26, 27).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Loss of function of p53 appears to confer selective advantages on cells through deregulated growth and resistance to apoptosis (28).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The p53 protein contains the three functional domains responsible for the transcriptional activation, sequence-specific DNA binding, and tetramerization from the N terminus (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Most of the p53 mutations found in tumor are localized in the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain in the central portion of the molecule (30).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	42	Although p53 is present in small quantities in most cells, several different types of DNA damage produced by -irradiation, ultraviolet irradiation, or genotoxic reagents, induces p53 (31).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	43	 p53 induces cell cycle arrest in essentially all types of cells or triggers apoptosis in some specific cell lineages and under certain cellular context (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This was shown to be related, at least partly, to its function as a sequence-specific transcription factor for the induction of a group of target genes (32) including p21WAF1/CIP1 (33), GADD45 (34), and Bax (35).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Among these, the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene has received the most attention (33).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	46	 p21WAF1/CIP1 binds to the cyclin/cyclin-dependent protein kinases complexes and inhibits the function of cyclin-dependent protein kinases during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, leading to DNA-damage-induced G1 arrest.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	47	 p53 also induces the expression of GADD45, which interacts with the replication and repair factor PCNA, thereby inhibiting the entry of cells into S phase (34, 36).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The p53 target gene, bax, encodes a protein that promotes cell death.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Siah-1A, which is a murine homologue of Drosophila Sina (seven in absentina) (37), is also induced by p53 and inhibits cell growth (38).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Drosophila Sina interacts with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCD1) and assists in the proteasome-dependent degradation of the transcription factor, Tramtrack (39, 40).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Human Siah also regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and transcriptional co-repressor N-CoR via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (41, 42).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Thus, p53 induces the expression of multiple target genes whose products act in a variety of processes including cell cycle regulation, replication, apoptosis, and protein degradation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	53	 p53 not only induces the expression of specific target genes but also directly binds to and acts on several cellular proteins such as TFIIH (43).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	54	 TFIIH is a component of the RNA polymerase II basal transcription factor and consists of two helicases.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	55	 p53 binds to these two helicases and modulate their activities (43).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Thus, p53 can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through multiple mechanisms.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Here we demonstrate that p53 directly binds to HSF3 and inhibits the c-Myb-induced activation of HSF3.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The results indicated that the C-terminal 79-amino acid region of the p53 molecule is responsible for the interaction with HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This region contains the tetramerization domain and the C-terminal region, which is rich in basic residues (47).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We observed that in vitro translated HSF3 could not bind to GST-p53, but that in vitro translated p53 could interact with GST-HSF3 (data not shown).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This suggests that tetramerization of p53 is required for binding to HSF3, because most of the GST-p53 on the glutathione resin is in a monomeric form.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These results suggest that none of these mutants could block the interaction between c-Myb and HSF3, although they were able to bind to HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In the presence of the p53 mutant lacking the C-terminal 93 amino acids (CT300), anti-HSF3 could not co-precipitate CT300.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Thus, the p53 interaction with HSF3 depends on the C-terminal 79-amino acid region of p53, and the interaction between p53 and HSF3 is apparently unaffected by many p53 point mutants commonly found in the tumors of cancer patients.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Because the crystal structure of p53 indicates that many point mutations cause structural defects (30), the conformation of p53 protein may be important for its ability to compete with c-Myb (see "Discussion").

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Treatment of DT40 cells with adriamycine for 24 h led to the induction of endogenous p53 protein.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The levels of HSP70 and HSP90 mRNAs were decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with that of control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA after treatment with two different concentration of adriamycine.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	294	 In contrast, the HSP90 mRNA level was not affected by adriamycine treatment, suggesting that HSP90 transcription is not regulated by HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In fact, it was reported that avian HSP90 mRNA is not inducible by thermal stress (49).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Thus, induction of p53 results in a decrease in the level of certain HSPs.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	297	 To confirm that endogenous c-Myb forms a complex with endogenous HSF3 in DT40 cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the anti-HSF3 antibody (Fig.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	300	 To examine for this, we treated DT40 cells with adriamycine for only 4.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	303	5 h, the anti-HSF3 antibody did not co-precipitate c-Myb, although the c-Myb protein level was not affected.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Thus, induction of p53 blocks complex formation between HSF3 and c-Myb and results in the down-regulation of certain HSPs.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	315	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	316	Our results indicate that p53 inhibits c-Myb-induced activation of HSF3 by two mechanisms (Fig.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	317	 7); (i) it competes with c-Myb for binding to HSF3 and (ii) it targets c-Myb for degradation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The mechanism through which p53 blocks the c-Myb-HSF3 interaction appears to be more than a simple competition for c-Myb binding to HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The p53 fragment containing only the C-terminal 79-amino acid region binds to HSF3 but cannot block the c-Myb-HSF3 interaction.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This suggests that the region other than the C-terminal HSF3-binding domain of p53 is also required for the dissociation of c-Myb from HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	321	 All of the five point mutations used in this study occur within the central DNA-binding core domain (residues 102-292), which represents the largest domain of this protein.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	322	 The crystal structure of the DNA-binding core domain suggests that three of the mutants (A138V, Q143A, and R175H) have denatured structure (30).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Conformational changes in the Q143A and R175H mutants were also suggested.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	324	 These two mutants bind to the antibody PAb240, which appears to be specific for denatured p53, but not to the antibody PAb1620, which recognizes the native state of p53 (50).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Probably, the normal protein conformation of this domain is critical for competing out c-Myb from c-Myb-HSF3 protein complexes.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	326	 According to the structural data, on the other hand, the other two mutants (R248W and R273H) probably retain their native structures, although they still display defective DNA binding activity (30).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Failure of these two mutants to compete out c-Myb suggests that the amino acid residues involved in DNA binding are also critical for c-Myb dissociation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The electrostatic repulsion via Arg-248 and Arg-273 could be critical for c-Myb dissociation from HSF3.

0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	330	   Schematic representation of p53 inhibition of c-Myb-induced HSF3 activation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	331	The p53 mutants bound to HSF3 but could not block the HSF3-c-Myb interaction.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	332	 This suggests that a trimolecular complex consisting of HSF3, c-Myb, and p53 mutant is active to stimulate transcription from the HSE-containing promoter.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	333	 At present, the molecular mechanism by which c-Myb stimulates the HSF3-mediated transcription is unknown, mainly because there is no information for the structure of the c-Myb-HSF3 complex.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Based on the recent finding with other transcription factors (reviewed in Ref.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	335	 51), it is likely that the binding of c-Myb to HSF3 recruits the transcriptional co-activator(s) linked to histone acetyltransferase.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Binding of p53 mutant to the c-Myb-HSF3 complex may not inhibit the association between c-Myb and co-activator(s).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	337	The c-Myb degradation induced by p53 could be another important mechanism controlling p53 inhibition of c-Myb-mediated HSF3 activation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Siah-1A is involved, at least partly, in the p53-induced degradation of c-Myb.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, is also induced by p53 and stimulates p53 degradation (52, 53).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	340	 However, Mdm2 did not enhance the degradation of c-Myb.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	341	2 The N-terminal RING finger domain of Siah-1 is responsible for the degradation of DCC and autodegradation, whereas the C-terminal region mediates oligomerization of Siah-1 protein and directly binds to DCC (54).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The DNA-binding domain of c-Myb directly binds to the N-terminal 231-amino acid region of Siah-1, suggesting that Siah-1 binds to target proteins through several regions.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Induction of c-Myb degradation was observed in CV-1 cells but was not obvious in 293T cells, suggesting that degradation may depend on the cell type.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	344	 These two cell lines may display differences in their levels of Siah-1 gene transcriptional regulators.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Cell type-dependent variations in proteasome-dependent protein degradation were also observed for Mdm2-induced degradation of p53 (55).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	346	 The c-Myb degradation induced by wild type p53 was not observed for the five point mutations of p53.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Because none of these p53 mutants can bind to the target DNA sequence, Siah-1 should not be induced by these p53 mutants.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	348	Actively proliferating cells display high expression of numerous proteins and require a higher level of HSP expression for protein folding and translocation.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	349	 HSPs are critical for cell cycle progression: for instance Wee1 tyrosine kinase, which regulates the length of the G2 phase, requires an interaction with Hsp90 (56).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Overexpression of Hsp70 also blocks the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor/heat shock (3, 4).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Thus, HSPs play a role in the progression of the cell cycle and protect the cell against apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	352	 c-Myb also plays a positive role for cell cycle progression and protects against apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	353	 It was reported that c-Myb induces the expression of S phase-specific genes and Bcl-2 and that the induction of these target genes mediate the capacity of c-Myb to induce cell cycle progression and to protect cells against apoptosis (24).
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	354	 In addition to these pathways, however, c-Myb activation of HSF3 could induce HSP expression and thereby contribute to cell cycle progression and the inhibition of apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	355	 In contrast to c-Myb, the p53 tumor suppressor protein induces cell cycle arrest at cell cycle check points such as the G1/S or G2/M transition and induces apoptosis.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	356	 A group of target genes such as p21WAF1/CIP1 (33), GADD45 (34), and Bax (35), whose expression is induced by p53, are thought to be responsible for cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis by p53.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Our study indicates that p53 also decreases the level of HSPs by blocking the c-Myb-mediated activation of HSF3.
0.5222704.10747903.html.plaintext.txt	358	 The present study suggests that suppression of HSP expression may also be an important pathway for cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis by p53.

0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Cr(VI) increased both protein level and transactivation ability of p53 protein.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The activation of p53 is at the protein level instead of the transcriptional level.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The degradation of p53 was dramatically decreased upon stimulation by Cr(VI).

0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	153	 To further understand the mechanisms of p53 activation by Cr(VI), we examined the possible roles of MAP kinase on p53 phosphorylation.

0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	178	 During the activation process, Erk plays a crucial role by mediating the phosphorylation of the Ser15 site of the p53 protein.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	179	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References   The present study shows that post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at the N-terminus, acetylation at the C-terminus and segregation of mdm2, play a central role in Cr(VI)-induced p53 activation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	180	Previous studies from our group have demonstrated that after exposure to Cr(VI), p53 protein is activated at the protein level and via enhancement of both sequence-specific DNA binding ability and transactivation ability (26).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In the present study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms of p53 activation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Several groups have reported that increased mRNA expression or transcriptional activation was important for p53 activation (44 to 46).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In our experiments, the addition of an inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, did not show any inhibitory effects on p53 activation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Consistent with this observation, the luciferase assay from cells transfected with p53 promoter to luciferase reporter plasmid demonstrates that p53 activation by Cr(VI) was not due to transcriptional activation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	185	P53 exists as a tetramer and rapidly degrades in normal cells.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The degradation is mediated by proto-oncoprotein mdm2.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The prerequisite for mdm2 to promote p53 degradation is its direct binding to the N-terminus of p53 protein.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	188	 In addition to mediating p53 degradation, the binding of mdm2 also blocks the transactivation ability of p53.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Therefore, breaking the p53 to mdm2 interaction is a major mechanism to stabilize p53.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Mdm2 protein immunoprecipitated with p53 decreased to undetectable levels with Cr(VI) stimulation, demonstrating the dissociation of mdm2 from p53 induced by Cr(VI).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The dissociation of mdm2 may be one explanation for the observed dramatic reduction in rate of p53 degradation after Cr(VI) stimulation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	192	One of the factors inducing disassociation of mdm2 from p53 is phosphorylation of p53 protein at its N-terminus.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	193	 N-terminal phosphorylation has been reported to activate the transactivation ability of p53 (22).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	194	 It is generally believed that the phosphorylation sites close to or inside the mdm2 binding site (residues 18 to 23), such as Ser15 and Ser20, are capable of interfering with the association between mdm2 and p53.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	195	 However, recent reports from several groups suggest that phosphorylation of the Ser15 site only affects p53's transactivation ability while Ser20 phosphorylation is believed to mediate the dissociation of mdm2 from p53 and the stabilization of p53 (47 to 49).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In the present study, we find reduced mdm2 binding was associated with Ser15 instead of Ser20 phosphorylation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Therefore, it appears that mdm2 dissociation induced by Cr(VI) is not due to Ser20 phosphorylation, and that phosphorylation of other sites, such as Ser15, may play a role in the dissociation process.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In addition to phosphorylation at the N-terminus of p53 protein, evidence is accumulating that mdm2 can be phosphorylated by DNA-PK and ATM following stimulation with DNA damaging reagents.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These phosphorylation events are considered to be another important mechanism for modulating interactions between mdm2 and p53 (50,51).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	200	Unlike N-terminal phosphorylation, modification at the C-terminus is involved in the regulation of the sequence-specific DNA binding ability of p53.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	201	 p53 exists as a tetramer in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells, the C-terminus acts as a negative regulatory domain by folding and binding to the central specific DNA binding domain of another monomer unit.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The phosphorylation and/or acetylation of the C-terminus results in the release of the latent specific DNA binding domain from the inhibitory domain.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Several stimuli, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and anisomycin, are reported to phosphorylate Ser392 (Ser389 in mouse) and so activate the specific DNA binding activity of p53 (26,52).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In the present study, Cr(VI) did not affect Ser392 phosphorylation in A549 cells.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Instead, significant acetylation at Lys382 was observed.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	206	 This acetylation at the C-terminus is likely to be responsible for the increase in specific DNA binding activity of p53 induced by Cr(VI).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	207	Several protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating distinct sites on the p53 protein.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The kinases DNA-PK, ATM, p38 and Erk are thought to be responsible for Ser15 phosphorylation of p53.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, different groups present contradictory results.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	210	 For example, p38 kinase was considered to phosphorylate Ser392 but not Ser15 in response to UV radiation (53).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In contrast, another group reported that upon stimulation with UV light, p38 kinase was responsible for phosphorylation of the Ser15 site (54).
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The different effects of upstream kinases in phosphorylating the same sites might be due to different cellular environments.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In our investigation, the results obtained demonstrate that it is Erk, and not p38, that is involved in the phosphorylation of Ser15.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	214	Although Cr(VI) is a well established carcinogen, its mechanism of action is not fully understood.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	215	 It is well established that p53 plays an important role in carcinogenesis.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The two major functions of p53 protein are cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which are responsible for repairing or removing the damaged cells.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Since these two processes have a crucial role in protecting cells from permanent genetic damage, which is mediated by p53, alterations in these pathways can contribute to cancer development.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of p53 activation is essential for the understanding of the overall carcinogenic process induced not only by Cr(VI), but also by other chemical and particle carcinogens.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	219	In conclusion, post-translational modifications, including Ser15 phosphorylation, Lys382 acetylation and mdm2 dissociation, play a crucial role in the process of Cr(VI)-induced p53 activation.
0.5748499.11323395.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Erk, and not p38 kinase, is responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser15 induced by Cr(VI).

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	4	A single dose of Mpl ligand (Mpl-L) given immediately after lethal DNA-damaging regimens prevents the death of mice.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, the mechanism of this myeloprotection is unknown.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The induction of p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage signals suggests that immediate administration of Mpl-L may inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This hypothesis was tested by administering a single injection of pegylated murine Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor (PEG-rmMGDF, a truncated recombinant Mpl-L) to p53/ and wild-type mice immediately after carboplatin (80 mg/kg) and 7.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	8	 PEG-rmMGDF was required to prevent the death of wild-type mice, whereas p53/ mice survived with or without the exogenous cytokine.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The degree of platelet depression and subsequent recovery was comparable in p53/ mice to wild-type animals given PEG-rmMGDF.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Hence, either Mpl-L administration or p53-deficiency protected multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and committed megakaryocyte precursors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The myelosuppressive regimen induced expression of p53 and the p53 target, p21Cipl in wild-type bone marrow, indicating that Mpl-L acts downstream of p53 to prevent apoptosis.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	19	The involvement of Mpl-L (also known as thrombopoietin or TPO) and its receptor Mpl in early hematopoiesis is consistent with the following observations: (1) Mpl is expressed on the AA4+ Sca+ subpopulation of murine hematopoietic stem cells6; (2) Mpl-L stimulates the expansion of very immature precursors both in vitro and in vivo; and (3) Mpl and Mpl-L are required for optimal multilineage hematopoietic development, as well as for thrombocytopoietic differentiation.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This latter point is evident by marked reductions in granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells in Tpo/ and c-Mpl/ mice,7,8 suggesting that Mpl and Mpl-L play significant roles in both megakaryocyte maturation and in the maintenance of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	21	9,10 Signaling by Mpl-L, alone or in combination with other early-acting cytokines, also promotes the survival of primitive multipotent progenitor cells by blocking apoptosis.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	72	1-5 The p53 tumor suppressor protein is an important mediator of apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents and -irradiation4,14 and therefore may contribute to the pathogenicity associated with myelosuppression.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The rationale and hypothesis of our studies was that if Mpl-L was acting to prevent cell death through a p53-dependent pathway, then Mpl-L administration to p53/ mice given a myelosuppressive regimen should provide no further hematopoietic protection over carrier-treated p53-null animals subjected to the same DNA damage.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Alternatively, if the cytokine blocks cell death via another pathway, p53/mice treated with DNA-damaging agents and Mpl-L should display less myelosuppression and faster hematopoietic recovery than p53/mice given myelosuppression and carrier alone.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In this case, the Mpl-L protective effect should be additive to the loss of p53 function.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	76	To determine the role of p53 in this response, and whether the protective effect of Mpl-L is due to its ability to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis, we exposed p53-deficient mice to a myelosuppressive regimen that is lethal to wild-type (WT) mice.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The WT and p53/groups of mice were subdivided immediately following exposure to the lethal myelosuppressive treatment; half of each group was given a single intravenous (IV) injection of PEG-rmMGDF (50  microg/kg), and half (the control group) received 1% normal mouse serum.

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	107	To determine whether the beneficial effects of PEG-rmMGDF targeted progenitor cells, we compared the in vitro colony-forming ability of bone marrow cells harvested on days 1 and 2 after the myelosuppressive regimen to that of marrow from WT untreated mice.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Bone marrow obtained from these mice was plated in methylcellulose containing IL-3, and colony number and size were scored after 13 days.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Colony formation from marrow of mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF or carrier and collected on day 1 and day 2 after treatment was markedly decreased compared with that of untreated marrow (Figure 3).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, bone marrow cells collected at 24 and 48 hours generated significantly greater colony numbers and sizes when derived from mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF as compared with carrier-treated mice (P  <  .
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	111	05) (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Furthermore, bone marrow from mice given the myelosuppression regimen and PEG-rmMGDF yielded a full spectrum of colony sizes, whereas bone marrow from those mice exposed to the myelosuppressive regimen without PEG-rmMGDF formed predominantly small colonies (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Therefore, Mpl-L promotes hematopoietic recovery by protecting bone marrow progenitors from DNA-damaging insults.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Colony formation by untreated p53/ marrow cells was not significantly different than that of untreated WT marrow (Figure 4, top panel).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	115	 As in Figure 3, colony formation from WT mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF at day 2 after treatment was significantly higher than that of carrier-treated p53+/+ mice (P  <  .
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In contrast, there was no additional protective effect of Mpl-L on the colony formation by bone marrow cells of p53/ mice collected at 48 hours after the myelosuppressive regimen as the number of colonies derived from the Mpl-L- and carrier-treated p53/ mice were not different (Figure 4, bottom panel).

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	137	 DNA damage is followed by rapid accumulation and activation of p53 that induces the expression of a number of downstream target genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	138	18 To assess the function of the p53 pathway in response to our myelosuppression regimen, we analyzed the expression of p53 and 2 of its transcription targets (p21Cip1 and Bax) in bone marrow cells at specific time intervals following carboplatin and -IR exposure by immunoblotting (Figure 5).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In response to this regimen, levels of p53 protein increased rapidly and were sustained for at least 6 hours before declining; PEG-rmMGDF administration did not significantly alter the magnitude or the kinetics of p53 induction (Figure 5, repeated in 5 separate experiments).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Bax, a proapoptotic factor that is up-regulated by p53 in some cell types,19-23 was constitutively expressed in bone marrow cells exposed to the DNA-damaging regimen and unaffected by the administration of PEG-rmMGDF.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	141	 By contrast, expression of p21Cip1, a cyclin kinase inhibitor,24 was markedly induced following carboplatin and -IR and this response paralleled the induction of p53 (Figure 5).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	142	 PEG-rmMGDF had no consistent differential effect on the induction of p21 during DNA damage, indicating that the beneficial effect of Mpl-L on hematopoietic cells is not due to a direct disruption of the p53 response; instead, Mpl-L appears to act downstream of p53 to prevent apoptosis (see "Discussion").

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These results, however, did not rule out the possibility that small changes in Bax expression and/or posttranslational modifications could significantly regulate the apoptotic response to this myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	154	 To assess the role of Bax in p53-mediated apoptosis in our myelosuppression model, we measured the survival and the hematopoietic recovery of Bax/ mice exposed to carboplatin and -IR, and whether PEG-rmMGDF affects this response.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Similar to WT littermate animals, Bax/ mice were highly susceptible to the lethal effects of this DNA-damaging regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Assessment of platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels indicated that Bax/ mice died due to hematopoietic failure (Figure 6A-C) (confirmed in 2 independent experiments).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Interestingly, Bax/ mice treated with PEG-rmMGDF exhibited a more rapid recovery of hemoglobin levels (on day 14, P  <  .

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	169	25,26 Loss of Atm in mice and humans is typically associated with attenuated p53 responsiveness and impaired cell cycle arrest.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Paradoxically, Atm/ mice display remarkable susceptibility to DNA-damaging insults,27,28 which appears to be cell-type specific and largely attributable to increased gastrointestinal sensitivity.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	171	29 Since p53-null bone marrow progenitors are resistant to DNA damage, we tested whether loss of Atm would also influence the response of bone marrow-derived progenitors to carboplatin and -IR.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	172	 To this end, we assessed the responses of WT mice receiving Atm/, p53/, p53+/, or WT bone marrow transplants to DNA damage.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Animals transplanted with Atm/ marrow and treated with PEG-rmMGDF succumbed earlier to the myelosuppressive regimen than did similarly treated mice transplanted with p53+/ and WT bone marrow, whereas all mice receiving p53/ transplants survived without PEG-rmMGDF treatment (Figure 7).

0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	181	The mechanism by which Mpl-L protects animals from a lethal myelosuppressive regimen has not been previously established.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Myelosuppressive agents such as chemotherapy and -IR are known to activate p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	183	14,15,30 Because Mpl is expressed on multipotential hematopoietic progenitors7-9,31 and its ligand, TPO, prevents apoptosis of these progenitors in vitro,11-13 we hypothesized that Mpl-L protects mice by preventing p53-dependent cell death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	184	 If this hypotheses is correct, then Mpl-L administration should not provide greater protection to hematopoiesis in p53/ mice, as compared with carrier-treated p53-null animals, following a myeloablative regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our findings support this hypothesis: when exposed to the same myelosuppressive insult, p53-deficient mice survived without Mpl-L treatment, whereas WT mice died.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Furthermore, p53/ mice subjected to the myelosuppression regimen and treated with Peg-rmMGDF had the same degree of myelosuppression and hematopoietic recovery profile as the p53/ mice given the myelosuppressive regimen and carrier alone.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These findings indicate that Mpl-L is acting to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis in vivo.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	188	The increased resistance of p53-deficient mice to the carboplatin and -IR regimen is consistent with the results of other investigators who have noted that p53/ mice survive 10 Gy of -IR, a dose that is lethal to WT mice.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	189	17 Correlative evidence has suggested that the radioresistance of p53-deficient mice is a consequence of reduced apoptosis of bone marrow cells.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	190	16,18 The results of our transplantation studies with p53-deficient marrow provide direct proof that the loss of p53 indeed protects mice from lethal myelosuppression; the results also suggest that p53-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors leads to hematopoietic failure and death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Nonetheless, carboplatin- and -IR-treated p53/ mice experienced substantial myelosuppression, indicating that hematopoietic cells also die by a p53-independent pathway(s).
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	192	We observed interesting differences between the hematopoietic responses of p53-deficient mice given PEG-rmMGDF or carrier versus WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF after the myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Hemoglobin concentration and WBC counts were reduced to a greater extent in WT mice given PEG-rmMGDF than in p53-deficient mice given PEG-rmMGDF or carrier alone.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	194	 By contrast, the degree of thrombocytopenia in these 3 groups was virtually identical.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	195	 We speculate that this difference reflects the disparate patterns of Mpl expression on the various hematopoietic progenitors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	196	9,10 In that case, all p53-null multipotential hematopoietic progenitors and committed precursors would be protected from p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas in the normal phenotype, only hematopoietic cells that express Mpl would be protected by Mpl-L.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	197	 If this view is correct, then concomitant administration of Mpl-L in combination with erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) immediately after a myelosuppressive insult might optimally reduce the degree of suppression of all 3 committed hematopoietic lineages.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	198	The number of bone marrow-derived colonies generated by cultures with IL-3 was substantially higher in mice that received PEG-rmMGDF after the myelosuppression regimen than carrier-only controls; this finding suggests that Mpl-L protects hematopoietic progenitors.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In contrast, the assays of bone marrow-derived colonies generated from myelosuppressed, Mpl-L-treated p53/ mice compared with carrier-treated p53/ mice demonstrated no additional protective effect of Mpl-L on colony formation.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These results support the conclusion from our in vivo experiments that Mpl-L is acting to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in vivo.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	201	Our analysis of protein expression provides insight into how Mpl-L prevents p53-dependent apoptosis after the myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The increase in p53 protein levels in bone marrow cells in response to carboplatin and -IR was unaffected by Mpl-L administration, indicating that PEG-rmMGDF did not protect hematopoietic cells by directly suppressing p53 expression.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Furthermore, the induction of p21Cip1 expression was not enhanced in carboplatin/radiation-treated WT mice after PEG-rmMGDF injection.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	204	 These results indicate that Mpl-L does not interfere with the p53 pathway at the level of p53-induction; rather, the cytokine appears to protect bone marrow cells by suppressing p53 function at a downstream step.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that cytokines, such as IL-3 and erythropoietin, protect against p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage by inducing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, both of which are potent suppressors of cell death.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	206	32,33 These findings support the hypothesis that cytokines block p53-mediated cell death by antagonizing downstream target genes, such as Bax or other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	207	Because Bax is directly transactivated by p53 and promotes apoptosis,21,34 we also tested the role of this gene by using Bax-deficient mice in our myelosuppression model.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We found that Bax is constitutively expressed in mouse bone marrow cells and that Bax levels are not affected by carboplatin plus -IR, or by the administration of PEG-rmMGDF.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Consistent with these findings, Bax deficiency did not protect the animals from the lethal dose of carboplatin and -IR.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	210	 However, when PEG-rmMGDF was given, platelet counts, WBC counts, and hemoglobin levels recovered more rapidly in Bax/ mice than in WT mice, indicating that Bax does play a proapoptotic role in the response of multipotential hematopoietic cells to this myelosuppressive regimen.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These findings convincingly demonstrate that loss of Bax is not equivalent to loss of p53 in protecting against lethal myelosuppression and that other downstream factors must mediate p53-dependent apoptosis under these conditions.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	212	The increased radiosensitivity of ATM/ mice has been attributed to the high level of apoptosis induced in the gastrointestinal tract of these mice29; however, the fact that recipients of Atm/ bone marrow transplants died at an accelerated rate after the myelosuppressive regimen, and were not protected by PEG-rmMGDF, indicates marrow toxicity plays a major role in the increased sensitivity of these mice to DNA-damaging agents.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	213	In summary, our observations indicate that Mpl-L administered immediately after a lethal myelosuppressive regimen promotes the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo by attenuating p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Myelosuppression is a toxicity-limiting component of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and a major clinical problem in autologous bone marrow transplantation regimens.
0.49731448.11567994.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Administration of Mpl-L during these DNA-damaging treatments should suppress the p53 response, thereby alleviating the severity of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia and the need for platelet transfusions.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	3	Wild-type p53 is degraded in part through the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Recent studies indicate that MDM2 can bind p53 and promote its rapid degradation although the molecular basis for this degradation has not been clarified.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This report demonstrates that MDM2 can promote the ubiquitination of wild-type p53 and cancer-derived p53 mutants in transiently transfected cells.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Deletion mutants that disrupted the oligomerization domain of p53 displayed low binding affinity for MDM2 and were poor substrates for ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination were restored when an oligomerization-deficient p53 mutant was fused to the dimerization domain from another protein.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These results indicate that oligomerization is required for p53 to efficiently bind and be ubiquitinated by MDM2.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	9	 p53 ubiquitination was inhibited in cells exposed to UV radiation, and this inhibition coincided with a decrease in MDM2 protein levels and p53 MDM2 complex formation.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In contrast, p53 dimerization was unaffected following UV treatment.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results suggest that UV radiation may stabilize p53 by blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 mediated by MDM2.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	12	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	13	Inactivation of p53 is considered an important step in the development of many human cancers.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It is therefore important to determine how p53 levels are normally regulated and how this regulation is altered in cancer.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The activity most associated with the tumor suppressor function of p53 is its ability to bind DNA and activate gene transcription (1-3).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This activity increases in response to DNA damage because of stabilization of the p53 protein (4, 5).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The effect of increasing p53 is to stop cell proliferation, either through a G1-phase cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death (6, 7).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Current models suggest that p53 is part of a DNA damage checkpoint pathway that monitors the genome integrity and protects cells from accumulating genetic damage.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	19	 p53 carries out this function by temporarily halting cell proliferation to allow DNA repair, or, in the case of irreparable damage, by inducing cell death through apoptosis.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	20	Two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in p53 degradation: the calpain proteolytic pathway (8, 9) and the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway (10, 11).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The relative contribution of these two pathways to p53 turnover has not been clarified.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The hallmark of the ubiquitin pathway is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (an 8-kDa protein) to a substrate, which "marks" that substrate for degradation (reviewed in Ref.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Ubiquitin is first sequentially transferred through a series of ubiquitin system enzymes, designated E1, E2, and E3.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The E3 enzyme then transfers the ubiquitin molecule to one or more lysine residues in the substrate (13).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Multiple ubiquitins are attached to one another to form ubiquitin chains, and the multi-ubiquitinated substrate is degraded by the 26 S proteasome.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Proof that p53 is a ubiquitin-system target came with the demonstration of wild-type p53:ubiquitin conjugates in vivo (11).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Factors that regulate and/or participate in p53 ubiquitination have not been fully characterized.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	28	Increasing evidence suggests that MDM2 can regulate p53 stability.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	29	 MDM2 forms an autoregulatory feedback loop in which p53 activates MDM2 transcription, and increased levels of MDM2 protein then bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (14, 15).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	30	 DNA-damaging agents that stabilize p53 can promote p53 phosphorylation at serines 15 and 37 (16).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Interestingly, MDM2 was unable to inhibit the activity of p53 when p53 was phosphorylated at these sites.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This could result if MDM2 is unable to bind p53 phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-37.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Other studies demonstrated that MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in transient transfection assays (17, 18).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Though the basis of this degradation was not clarified, Honda et al.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	35	 (19) reported that MDM2 could promote p53 ubiquitination in vitro in the presence of E1 and E2 ubiquitin system enzymes.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Further, MDM2 formed a thioester bond with ubiquitin, a characteristic of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Mutations in MDM2 that abrogated thioester bond formation also abrogated p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that MDM2 functions as an E3 enzyme in p53 ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Taken together, these studies provide a provocative model for the regulation of p53 stability.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	39	 According to this model, MDM2 binds p53 under normal conditions and promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated at Ser-15 and Ser-37, preventing MDM2 binding and thus stabilizing p53.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The stabilized p53 can then promote transcription of its downstream target genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	42	This report demonstrates the presence of p53:ubiquitin conjugates in cells transiently transfected with p53 expression DNAs.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	43	 High levels of p53 ubiquitination were observed when cells were cotransfected with MDM2, providing evidence that MDM2 can promote p53 ubiquitination in vivo.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Deletion mutants that disrupted the oligomerization domain of p53 had low MDM2 binding affinity and were poor substrates for ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination were restored when oligomerization-deficient p53 mutants were fused to a heterologous dimerization domain.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Finally, p53 ubiquitination was inhibited in UV-irradiated cells, and this coincided with decreased MDM2 protein levels and p53 MDM2 complex formation.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The purpose of this study was to determine the basis for this degradation and the amino acid determinants in p53 required for this effect.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Saos-2 cells (p53 null) were transfected with expression DNAs encoding p53, MDM2, and myc-tagged ubiquitin.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	78	 A ladder of protein bands with molecular weights larger than p53 were recognized when p53 was coexpressed with MDM2.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These bands ranged in size from ~63 to 90 kDa, consistent with the addition of one to five ubiquitin moieties to p53.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	80	 When Myc-tagged ubiquitin was coexpressed with p53 and MDM2, these bands shifted to a slightly larger molecular weight, consistent with the additional Myc-tag.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	81	 To confirm these bands as p53:ubiquitin conjugates, cells were transfected with epitope-tagged p53 (HA-p53) and Myc-tagged ubiquitin.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	100	 R273H ubiquitination could be seen on long gel exposures, but the extent of R273H ubiquitination was consistently lower than that of either V143A or R248W.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	122	 p53-(1-363) and p53-(1-353) maintain the oligomerization function of p53, while oligomerization is lost in p53-(1-333) (22).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	123	 All three deletion mutants maintain the major nuclear localization signal (NLSI, residues 316-325) of p53 (23).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Wild-type p53 and the deletion mutants p53-(1-363) and p53-(1-353) were efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2 (Fig.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In contrast, ubiquitination was drastically reduced in p53-(1-333), indicating that sequences between 333 and 353 are required for efficient ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	127	 There are three possible explanations for these results.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	128	 First, deletion of residues 333 to 353 may have removed critical lysine residues that are sites of p53 ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	129	 There is one lysine (position 351) between residues 333 and 353, and a p53 protein with this site mutated to isoleucine was efficiently ubiquitinated by MDM2 (not shown).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Second, deletion of residues 333 to 353 may have abrogated MDM2 binding.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Third, p53 oligomerization may be required for ubiquitination by MDM2, and deleting this function in p53-(1-333) may have thus prevented ubiquitination.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In contrast, very low levels of MDM2 coimmunoprecipitated with p53-(1-333).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	142	 These results establish a correlation between MDM2 binding and p53 ubiquitination and suggest that deletion of residues 333 to 353 abrogated p53 ubiquitination by diminishing the ability of p53 to bind MDM2.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	149	To determine whether oligomerization affected either p53 ubiquitination or p53 MDM2 binding, the effect of replacing the oligomerization domain of p53 with the dimerization domain from another protein was determined (Fig.

0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	196	The activity of wild-type p53 is regulated in large part through changes in protein stability.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	197	 It is of interest therefore to identify cellular factors that regulate p53 turnover.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The most compelling evidence that MDM2 normally regulates p53 levels comes from David Lane and colleagues (25, 26).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Phage-display was used in these studies to identify a 12-amino acid peptide that mimics the MDM2 binding site in p53 and blocks p53 MDM2 binding.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	200	 When expressed in cells containing low p53 levels, this peptide caused an accumulation of p53, activation of p53-responsive genes, and a cell cycle arrest.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In contrast, a mutant peptide unable to block p53 MDM2 binding had no effect.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These results provided strong evidence that p53 levels and activity are normally regulated by MDM2 interaction.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Other studies demonstrated that MDM2 can promote p53 degradation in transient transfection assays (17, 18) although the basis of this degradation was not fully clarified.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The current report demonstrates that MDM2 can promote the formation of p53:ubiquitin conjugates in vivo.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	205	 These results are consistent with those of Honda et al.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	206	 (19), which suggested that MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase in p53 ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	207	Cancer-derived p53 mutant proteins varied in their susceptibility to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, with the V143A and R248W mutants being more prone to ubiquitination than the R273H mutant.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This did not appear to result from a lower ability of R273H to bind MDM2, suggesting that factors other than MDM2 binding can affect p53 ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	209	 One possibility is that these p53 mutants vary in their subcellular localization, and this accounts for their differences in ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It has been suggested that p53 ubiquitination by MDM2 occurs in the nucleus (27), and certain p53 mutants may be retained in the cytoplasm (28) where they may not be ubiquitinated.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The conformation of p53 might also affect its susceptibility to ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	212	 It is worth noting that the V143A and R248W p53 mutants were more highly ubiquitinated than either wild-type p53 or R273H.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Perhaps R273H adopts a more wild-type conformation than V143A or R248W and so is less susceptible to ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	214	Deletion analyses indicated that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 was required for efficient MDM2 binding and ubiquitination.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This is perhaps surprising given that the MDM2 binding site in p53 is located in the N terminus of p53 (29).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Further, MDM2 can interact with peptides from the N terminus of p53, indicating that C-terminal sequences are not essential for the interaction to occur.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Perhaps the MDM2 binding domain in p53 assumes a more complex tertiary structure when p53 is oligomerized, which enhances its affinity for MDM2.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	218	 These results are consistent with those of Karen Vousden and her coworkers (24) who recently demonstrated that p53 proteins with disrupted oligomerization function displayed decreased binding affinity for MDM2 and were less susceptible to MDM2-mediated degradation.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	219	p53 is stabilized in response to various DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation (5), UV radiation (5), actinomycin D (30), and cisplatin (31).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The molecular basis of this stabilization is unknown.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in p53 degradation; the calpain proteolysis system (8, 9) and the ubiquitin proteolysis system (10, 11).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Given that p53 is degraded through these two pathways, one possibility is that DNA damaging agents signal a repression of p53 degradation through the calpain system, the ubiquitin system, or both.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This report demonstrates that p53 ubiquitination is inhibited in response to UV radiation.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This inhibition coincided with decreased expression of MDM2, and a decrease in p53 MDM2 complexes.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This suggests that UV radiation may stabilize p53, at least in part, by inhibiting MDM2 expression and thus blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of p53.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	226	 DNA-damaging agents can promote p53 phosphorylation, and it has been suggested that this phosphorylation could stabilize p53 by blocking p53 MDM2 complex formation (16).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	227	 It remains possible that such post-translational modifications might also contribute to the UV-induced loss of p53 ubiquitination observed in the current report.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	228	Current models suggest that p53 functions in a pathway that monitors the DNA and protects cells from accumulating genetic damage.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	229	 p53 carries out this function in response to DNA damage by temporarily halting cell proliferation to allow DNA repair or by eliminating the damaged cell through apoptosis (6, 7).
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This model predicts that p53 inactivation would be necessary for cells to resume cycling following repair of the damaged DNA.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	231	 In this regard, it is worth noting the studies of Perry et al.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	232	 (32) in which the kinetics of MDM2 and p53 induction were examined in UV-irradiated cells.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Three important findings emerged: 1) the induction of MDM2 was delayed in UV-treated cells even though p53 levels rose almost immediately; 2) MDM2 induction was delayed for longer periods of time with increasingly larger UV doses; and 3) the time of MDM2 induction was correlated with the recovery of normal rates of DNA synthesis, presumably after DNA repair.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Based on these results, it is reasonable to speculate that MDM2 expression may be inhibited in UV-irradiated cells to allow an accumulation of p53 and a subsequent cell cycle arrest and DNA repair.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Once DNA repair is completed, the induction of MDM2 may then allow for p53 ubiquitination and degradation and for continued cell cycle progression.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	236	 It will be of interest to determine whether MDM2 induction following UV radiation is coincident with repair of the UV-induced DNA lesions.
0.5889717.10347217.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This would suggest that MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 is important for cells to resume cycling after DNA damage.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	1	Department of Surgery and Molecular Oncology, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	2	In the 25 years since its first description the p53 protein has been shown to play a key role in both tumour suppression and aging.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	3	 New discoveries about the function and control of p53 continue to emerge every month and attempts to exploit the system to develop better therapeutics and diagnostics are beginning to be successful in the clinic (1,2).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	4	The genetics of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	5	The current model for p53 function as a tumour suppressor is that the protein acts as a highly regulated transcription factor.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Normally p53 is a very unstable protein and is present only in minute concentrations in the cell.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Even these small amounts of p53 are not fully active as a transcription factor, because the negative regulator protein, Mdm2, binds them.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	8	 When cells are exposed to a wide variety of aberrant growth signals, the p53 protein is activated and stabilized and triggers the expression of downstream genes such as p21 that trigger cell cycle arrest, or Puma that triggers apoptosis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This response is potentially lethal since mice that have p53 but lack Mdm2 die very early in development at the pre-implantation stage (3,4).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The response is vital to control tumour growth as mice that lack p53 develop spontaneous early onset malignancies (5).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	11	 More recently however another aspect of p53 regulation has emerged.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In two mouse models where p53 activity is modulated and increased by the expression of an N-terminally truncated form of the protein, accelerated aging phenotypes are seen (6 to 8).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, the p53 response needs to be very finely controlled in order to provide adequate tumour suppression without promoting accelerated aging.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	14	Haploinsufficiency Genetic and biochemical studies have demonstrated a rich variety of genes and pathways that act to control p53 function and thresholds.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These must act in concert to precisely control the activity of p53.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These pathways are nearly always disrupted in cancer cells that need to avoid the full p53 response if they are to grow and survive.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Genetic studies have helped to clarify the importance of key players in this pathway and also suggested suitable points for therapeutic intervention.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The huge number of biochemical and cell biological studies on the p53 protein can be hard to evaluate but the genetic models provide an increasingly firm basis on which to build a core understanding of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Studies of the responses of heterozygote wild-type over null mice (p53+/ to ) have demonstrated unequivocally that the p53 locus does not obey Knudsen's two hit hypothesis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Instead there is clear evidence of haploinsufficiency at the locus.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Thus, cells that contain a single copy of the p53 gene as opposed to two copies show an impaired response to radiation-induced apoptosis and tumours that arise in these mice quite frequently retain the wild-type allele (9).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This also seems to occur in the tumours of individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome where not all tumours show loss of the single wild-type parental allele.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This implies that the regulation of the p53 system is exceptionally tightly controlled and that gene dosage and transcription is a critical method by which the p53 threshold is set.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	24	Implications of a hypomorphic Mdm2 allele Further support for the tight control of the p53 system emerges from elegant studies on a mouse model that carries a hypomorphic allele of the Mdm2 gene (10 to 12).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The Mdm2 protein binds to p53 and targets it for degradation by acting as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that results in the specific ubiquitination of p53.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In mice that are +/ to  at the mdm2 locus no phenotype is evident but in mice that express a slightly lower level of Mdm2 from a single hypomorphic allele thymic ablation, poor weight gain and bone marrow and intestinal cell loss are evident.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All of these phenotypes are dependant on wild-type p53 and do not require any exogenous signal.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The data strongly suggest that p53 is always active in these target tissues and that Mdm2 is a rate limiting negative regulator normally expressed at roughly three times the level needed to repress p53 function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The fact that the inactivation of the Mdm2 related gene Mdmx (or Mdm4) (13) also gives a p53 dependant early embryonic lethal phenotype has implied that this less well studied gene also must be critical in controlling p53 and that it cannot be compensated for by Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	30	The p19Arf locus and other regulators of p53 Other genes that control p53 function have also been verified by genetic analysis and the upstream genes ATM and CHK2 clearly act to regulate p53 response, as does the negative regulator of Mdm2 p19Arf.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Fascinatingly while p19Arf acts as a critical activator of p53 that suppresses tumour genesis it does not alter the phenotype of the Mdm2 hypomorphic mice (11).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This implies that the normal regulation of p53 is not modulated by p19Arf but that the p19Arf control pathway is activated by early events in the tumorigenic process.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Other genes that modulate wild-type p53 function are fragments of p53 and mutant p53 s.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Most point mutations in p53 that inactivate its function can also act as dominant negative mutants and are thus seen to act as oncogenes in transgenic mouse models.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The affect of the two N-terminal truncations that promote aging is subtler however as they seem to activate wild-type function but perhaps act selectively to promote p53 function at some but not all p53 responsive promoters.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Finally, the two p53 related genes p63 and p73 could also modulate p53 responses in vivo (14).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Recently, further study of the ubiquitin pathway has identified two new E3 s for p53 the Cop1 (15) and Pirh2 (16) proteins.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Thus, negative regulation of p53 seems to occur through at least four E3 or E3-like proteins (COP1, Pirh2, Mdm2, Mdm4) and three of these, Cop1, Pirh2 and Mdm2, are p53-induced genes.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This creates a very complex and responsive control circuit able to fine-tune the p53 response.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Another new gene that also looks as though it may be a powerful modulator of the response is the deubiquitinating enzyme HAUSP (17 to 19).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Again genetic studies using knock in mice have established that p53 must have an intact N-terminal transactivation domain to function as a tumour suppressor as the knock in mouse that expresses a p53 mutant at amino acids 25 and 26 (20) is no longer able to suppress tumorigenesis and in fact, despite expressing high levels of the mutant p53 protein, has an identical phenotype to a p53 null mouse.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	42	 While a very large number of genes have been identified as potential down stream targets of p53 activation or suppression only three have been established as being of critical importance in vivo these are the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and Puma (21,22) and the cell cycle regulatory CDK inhibitor p21.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	43	 While knock out of these downstream response genes has a clear affect on the phenotype of the p53 dependant DNA damage response none of the knock out mice have the dramatic tumour prone phenotype of the p53 null mice.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	44	The increased understanding of the control of the p53 pathway that derives from these genetic studies has raised many points at which the pathway may be modulated or inactivated and the pharmaceutical manipulation of the p53 pathway is within our grasp.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	45	 A more sobering reflection however derives from consideration of the probable affects of functional polymorphisms at these loci in the human population.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Thus, we can expect both coding and non-coding polymorphisms at these multiple control loci to be segregating in the population.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This means that one can readily imagine gene combinations that will give reduced tumour protection or accelerated aging phenotypes.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	48	Inactivation of p53 in human tumours.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	49	Mutation in p53 The most common route by which the p53 pathway is inactivated in human cancers is by mutation in the coding region of the p53 gene.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations have been extensively catalogued and have provided a powerful database in examining mutational spectra compared with predicted environmental causes of cancer in man.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The mutations occur at many sites within the gene but the most common class of mutation is a point mis-sense mutation in the central DNA binding domain of the protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	52	 These mutant proteins can accumulate to high levels in tumour cells where they are readily detected by antibody staining.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The mutations act as dominant negative mutations as the full-length mutant protein will form mixed inactive oligomers with the wild-type protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	54	 All of the mutants seem to be defective as transcription factors, which has formed the basis for yeast based functional assay for mutant p53 detection.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Structural and physical biochemical studies of the mutant proteins has helped to promote some understanding as to why mutations at so many different locations in the protein can all inactivate its function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The current model would suggest that the core DNA binding domain of p53 is only just stable at body temperature, thus very small structural alterations are sufficient to destabilize the protein completely.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	57	 This is consistent with the finding that many of the mutant p53 proteins are temperature sensitive and if expressed at lower temperature can regain p53 wild-type activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It also helps to explain how antibodies to epitopes within the folded core of the protein are exposed by many different p53 mutations (23 to 28).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	59	 As will be discussed later this property of instability may allow the development of novel mutant p53 reactivating compounds.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Why should p53 be so unstable? It is reasonable to suppose that this property may allow its rapid breakdown and close regulation as it would be more difficult to switch off a very stable protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Our knowledge of the affects of p53 mutations is still incomplete however.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In some systems the mutant proteins appeared to have gained new functions beyond that of simply acting as dominant negative p53 mutants and other models make it clear that while p53 is often described as having a domain structure these domains do have a strong interconnection with each other.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Thus, a small mutation in the N-terminal domain of p53 can cause the second site reversion of a temperature sensitive mutation in the DNA binding core of the protein (29).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The accumulation of mutant p53 proteins in cancer cells is not yet understood.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	65	 An attractive model is that the loss of p53 transcription reduces the level of the E3 ligases so that p53 accumulates.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, other mechanisms may be at play, because in a knock in mouse model that expresses a mutant p53 protein in all tissues, p53 protein accumulation seems only to occur in cancer cells (T.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	67	Other routes to p53 inactivation Half of all human tumours retain wild-type p53 so how is the tumour suppressor function of p53 bypassed in these systems? One route is by inactivation of upstream signalling pathways; thus, CHK2 mutations have been reported in breast cancers, tumours arise in patients with ATM, loss of p19Arf expression is common in many cancers and amplification and over-expression of Mdm2 may occur in up to 9% of cancers.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In cervical cancers the expression of the HPV E6 protein inactivates p53 and it is probable that as more components of the p53 response pathway are uncovered that it will be possible to see many new ways that the pathway is abrogated.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The role of COP1 Pirh2 and HAUSP for example has yet to be determined.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Overexpression of survival signals and of anti-apototic proteins can also help tumour cells to evade p53 activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	71	Therapy and the p53 pathway The implications of the p53 pathway in the treatment of cancer have been appreciated for the last decade.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Many current treatments trigger the p53 response in normal and tumour tissue and a critical question has been whether or not the p53 status of a tumour affects the chance of a response to treatment.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	73	 While in animal models dramatic affects can be seen with p53 wild-type tumours responding much better to chemotherapeutic drugs, the data obtained with human material is less clear cut.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This reflects the genetic complexity of human cancer, the technical difficulties of working with patient samples and the possibility that many  wild-type  p53 tumours may have other defects in the pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	75	 More encouraging perhaps has been the discovery and development of therapies based on the understanding of the p53 pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	76	p53 gene therapy The delivery of Wt p53 using an adenoviral expression vector has been approved in China as part of a radiotherapy/gene therapy combination for head and neck cancer and a similar  p53 virus  is in a late-stage clinical trial in the USA (30).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	77	 While delivery of the virus to all tumour cells is not possible, bystander affects and possibly immune phenomena may be acting to make these therapies effective.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	78	 It is possible to design more active variants of p53 by introducing mutations that block the binding of the negative regulator Mdm2 or that stabilize the core structure of the protein.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	79	 While these clearly offer a superior performance in model systems more work will be needed to see if they maintain the excellent safety features of the wild-type p53 virus in human trials.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	80	Onyx 0-15 This E1B region deletion mutant of wild-type Adenovirus was first reported to replicate preferentially in cells that lacked wild-type p53 (31).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	81	 This exciting concept proved more complex on closer analysis and the viruses selective replication in tumour cells seems now to depend on tumour cells over-expressing host proteins that compensate for the E1B mutant viruses deficiencies in nuclear export (32).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Nevertheless some encouraging clinical responses were seen and it is to be hoped that development of this therapy, which had the potential to attack systemic disseminated disease, will continue.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	83	Rescuing mutant p53 A number of approaches to the rescue of mutant p53 have been proposed.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Screening programmes have yielded some promising early leads, some of which have shown activity in animal models but the exact mechanism of action of these compounds is disputed.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Early work suggested that peptides derived from the C-terminus of p53 could activate the DNA binding function of some mutant p53 proteins (33 to 37).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Again while the mechanism of this affect has been widely discussed no complete consensus has been achieved.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Strikingly however in the last year Dowdy (38) and his colleagues have shown that such a C-terminal peptide when fused to a cell transport sequence and derived from D amino acids for stability can completely cure an aggressive intraperitoneal tumour in mice.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	88	The non-genotoxic activation of p53 for therapy by inhibiting the p53 to Mdm2 interaction Intense study of the activation of the p53 response has revealed a number of ways to turn on the p53 response without causing DNA damage.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In those tumours that retain wild-type p53 such approaches may yield exciting new treatment options.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Extensive analysis of the p53 to Mdm2 interaction using synthetic peptide libraries, phage display and peptide scaffolds (39 to 42) demonstrated that blocking this interaction was able to activate p53 to induce growth arrest and apoptosis.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The solved crystal structure of the interaction and the peptide database has now allowed two groups to develop small molecule inhibitors of the interaction that can trigger the p53 response (43).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In a very elegant work, a group of compounds called the Nutlins have been shown to activate p53 by blocking p53 binding to Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In xenograft models these lead molecules demonstrated excellent tumour growth control without toxicity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	94	 These results have greatly encouraged the Pharmaceutical Industry by validating Mdm2 inhibition as a therapeutic target and establishing that protein to protein interactions can be appropriate targets for small molecule drugs.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	95	Other small molecule activators of the p53 response Screening assays based on p53 reporter cells have identified many small molecules that can activate the p53 response without causing DNA damage.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A particularly potent activator is the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (44 to 46).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This streptomycete antibiotic binds to and inhibits the nuclear exportin protein CRM1.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The inhibition of export activates p53 dependent transcription dramatically and while it must affect many other proteins as well, cell based studies have shown that much of the cell cycle and apoptotic response to leptomycin B is p53 dependent.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	99	 While normal cells can recover from a leptomycin-induced p53 dependent growth arrest the compound induces apoptotic death in p53 wild-type human tumour cells.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Other molecules that are non-genotoxic activators of the p53 response include the cdk inhibitor Roscovitine (47,48).
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The R isomer (CYC202) of this compound is currently in clinical trial.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	102	 CYC202 appears to induce p53 by partially inhibiting transcription.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The link between transcription and signalling to p53 is currently the focus of intense study as it may represent a unifying principal in how the p53 pathway senses cellular stress that should invoke the p53 system.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	104	The p53 protein is controlled by multiple negative regulators and activators to ensure that it achieves a high therapeutic index, protecting the organism from cancer whilst not damaging too many stem cells.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In order to escape the p53 pathway nearly all human cancers have either mutated the p53 gene itself or altered the sensitivity or effectiveness of the pathway.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Cancer cells are exceptionally sensitive to reactivation of p53 function and therefore treatments that achieve this promise to be exceptionally effective.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The use of p53 in gene therapy has already been approved and several small molecules that can activate the p53 pathway without non-specific toxicity are under development.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	108	 One of these, a small molecule cdk inhibitor is in phase 11 clinical trial.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Expanding knowledge of the p53 pathway means that further strategies to manipulate the p53 pathway are emerging rapidly and one can predict that the next 25 years should see our knowledge of this fascinating protein being put to extensive clinical use for the benefit of patients worldwide.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	112	 When p53 is active it induces three classes of genes that have been established genetically to be essential for its function.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	113	 One class exemplified by the CDK inhibitor protein p21 can cause cell cycle arrest.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Another class exemplified by the BH3 domain proteins Puma and Noxa promote apoptosis, while a third class of genes exemplified by Mdm2, Pirh2 and Cop1 act to negative regulate p53 activity.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The activity of this group of negative regulators, is in turn, moderated by the HAUSP and Arf proteins.

0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The activity of Mdm2 as an E3 ligase is inhibited by Mdm2 itself, acting to ubiquitinate itself promoting auto-ubiquitination and degradation.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This activity is counteracted by the HAUSP isopeptidase that can stabilize and activate Mdm2.
0.6555275.15205365.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Removal of HAUSP can therefore activate p53 by reducing the activity of Mdm2 as an inhibitor of p53 function.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	6	Prompt reconstitution of hematopoiesis after cytoreductive therapy is essential for patient recovery and may have a positive impact on long-term prognosis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We examined the role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic recovery in vivo after treatment with the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We used p53 knock-out (p53/) and wild-type (p53+/+) mice injected with 5-FU as the experimental model.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Analysis of the repopulation ability and clonogenic activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their lineage-committed descendants showed a greater number of HSCs responsible for reconstitution of lethally irradiated recipients in p53/ bone marrow cells (BMCs) recovering after 5-FU treatment than in the corresponding p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In post-5-FU recovering BMCs, the percentage of HSC-enriched Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells was about threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Although the percentage of the most primitive HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/) did not depend on p53, the percentage of multipotential HSCs and committed progenitors (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+) was almost fourfold higher in post-5-FU recovering p53/ BMCs than in their p53+/+ counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The pool of HSCs from 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs was exhausted more slowly than that from the p53+/+ population as shown in vivo using pre-spleen colony-forming unit (CFU-S) assay and in vitro using long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and methylcellulose replating assays.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Clonogenic activity of various lineage-specific descendants was significantly higher in post-5-FU regenerating p53/ BMCs than in p53+/+ BMCs, probably because of their increased sensitivity to growth factors.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Despite all these changes and the dramatic difference in sensitivity of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs to 5-FU-induced apoptosis, lineage commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors appeared to be independent of p53 status.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These studies suggest that suppression of p53 function facilitates hematopoietic reconstitution after cytoreductive therapy by: (1) delaying the exhaustion of the most primitive HSC pool, (2) stimulating the production of multipotential HSCs, (3) increasing the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to growth factors, and (4) decreasing the sensitivity to apoptosis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	16	    INTRODUCTION Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion References.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	17	HEMATOPOIESIS IS regulated by numerous growth factors, which act in concert to regulate proliferation (including self-renewal), differentiation, and apoptosis, thus generating a relatively constant pool of functionally mature blood cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, normal hematopoiesis can be perturbed by a variety of factors such as infection, reduced oxygen concentration, irradiation, and drugs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Cytostatics, which are routinely used as antineoplastic drugs, are toxic to bone marrow cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In light of the importance of prompt bone marrow repopulation for patient outcome, analyses of the mechanisms regulating this process hold promise in leading to novel therapies that facilitate hematopoietic repopulation after cytostatic treatment or bone marrow transplantation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	21	The p53 tumor suppressor gene may be one of the key genes involved in regulating hematopoietic repopulation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although hematopoiesis in p53 knock-out (p53/) mice appears to proceed normally,1 numerous in vitro studies indicate that p53 is involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of the hematopoietic cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	23	2-7 Moreover, p53 deletions and mutations have been found at high frequency in acute leukemias and in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	24	8 The p53 phosphoprotein acts not only as a transcriptional activator of genes containing p53 binding sites,9 but also as a potent inhibitor of transcription from many genes containing TATA boxes and lacking p53-binding sites.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	25	10 p53 plays a critical role in cell proliferation by modulating the expression of genes such as WAF-1, which are required for progression through the cell cycle.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	26	11 Furthermore, p53 is involved in the induction of apoptosis after DNA damage,12 possibly by transactivating bax, a proapoptotic member of the bcl-2 family.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	27	In the present study, we examined the role of p53 in the in vivo recovery of hematopoiesis after treatment with cytostatic agents.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Bone marrow cells obtained from p53 knock-out (p53/) and p53 wild-type (p53+/+) mice treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were tested for their in vivo repopulation ability and the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and lineage-committed progenitors.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	94	 On day 6 after 5-FU administration, p53/ mice contained fivefold to eightfold more BMCs than their wild-type counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This phenomenon probably reflects the diminished apoptosis in p53/ cells, because injection of 5-FU into the p53+/+ mice resulted in massive apoptosis of BMCs on days 2 and 4, whereas BMCs from p53/ mice became apoptotic only sporadically (Fig 2).

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Apoptotic cells were detected by TACS apoptosis assay in femoral bone marrows of p53+/+ (left panel) and p53/ (right panel) mice on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after 5-FU injection.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Results are representative of three independent experiments.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	103	Analysis of growth factor requirements of colony-forming units indicated that post-5-FU repopulating p53/ BMCs, as compared with their p53+/+ counterparts, formed more colonies in threshold (0.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	104	1 U/mL), suboptimal (1 U/mL) and saturating (10 U/mL) concentrations of recombinant murine IL-3 (Fig 3).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Thus, the absence of p53 in regenerating cells underlies their increased sensitivity to stimulation by growth factors, consistent with previous studies showing the importance of the p53 status in the response of hematopoietic cells to growth factor stimulation.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	113	The differences between p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs in proliferation potential and sensitivity to apoptosis were confirmed by Western blotting analysis of proteins involved in cell cycle activity (PCNA, WAF-1, and p16INK4a) and in apoptosis (bcl-2, bax, bcl-xL, and bak) on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after 5-FU injection (Fig 4).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	114	 p53 expression was not detectable on day 0, but increased significantly on days 2, 4, and 6 in p53+/+ samples, in accord with previous findings.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	115	20 As expected, p53 was not detectable in p53/ samples.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	116	 High levels of PCNA were detected in each sample of p53/ BMCs after 5-FU treatment, whereas in p53+/+ BMCs, PCNA expression was decreased on day 2, undetectable on day 4, but again detectable on day 6 after injection of the drug.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	117	 p16INK4a levels decreased slightly in p53+/+ BMCs on days 2, 4, and 6.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	118	 In contrast, p16INK4a expression was low on days 0, 2, and 4, but markedly increased on day 6 in p53/ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	119	 WAF-1 levels increased in both p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs after 5-FU treatment, but the increase was detectable earlier and was more pronounced in the p53+/+ population.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Together, these data confirmed that p53/ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU had higher proliferative potential than their p53+/+ counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed markedly enhanced bcl-2 levels in p53/ BMCs on days 2 and 4, but low level expression at all other time points as in p53+/+ samples.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Expression of bcl-xL was similar in both p53+/+ and p53/ populations.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Both bax and bak proteins were highly expressed on days 2 and 4 in p53+/+ BMCs, but undetectable in other samples including those from p53/ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus, expression of proapoptotic effectors (bax, bak) relative to antiapoptotic (bcl-2, bcl-xL) effectors was high in p53+/+ cells on days 2 and 4 after 5-FU treatment, whereas the reverse was observed in p53/ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	125	Role of p53 in repopulation of HSCs after 5-FU treatment in vivo.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	126	   To compare the ability of p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs obtained from 5-FU-treated mice to rescue animals exposed to a lethal dose of TBI, decreasing numbers of p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs were injected into recipient mice, and long-term survival was scored at 16 weeks postinjection.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Lower numbers of p53/ BMCs than p53+/+ BMCs were required to rescue TBI-treated recipient mice (Table 1), suggesting that post-5-FU repopulating p53/ BMCs contain more HSCs capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis in vivo.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	128	 BMCs from the p53+/+ and p53/ mice not treated with 5-FU showed no difference in their ability to repopulate in TBI-treated recipients (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	129	 PCR analysis to assess the presence of the p53 knock-out and wild-type alleles in the mononuclear fraction of BMCs obtained from mice transplanted with p53/ BMCs showed only the knock-out allele (not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Thus, long-term hematopoiesis in the transplanted hosts was caused by p53/ marrow cells and not by normal marrow cells that may have escaped lethal irradiation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Analysis of blood smears and bone marrow sections showed normal hematopoiesis in mice transplanted with either p53+/+ or p53/ BMCs (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Quantitative PCR followed by Southern blotting to assess the proportion of p53/ to p53+/+ BMCs in TBI-treated recipient mice injected IV with a 1:1 mixture of both indicated a ratio of 10:1 to 100:1 in bone marrow obtained 16 weeks after transplantation (Fig 5).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Mice were free of leukemia at the time of BMC collection as confirmed by histological analysis of bone marrow and other organs (blood, spleen, and thymus).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	134	 These results suggest that the absence of p53 gene expression has a positive impact on the repopulation ability of BMCs after treatment with 5-FU.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	141	   To determine whether the more vigorous repopulation ability of p53/ BMCs reflected an increased number of HSCs, immunostaining followed by flow cytometry was used to quantitate HSCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	142	 p53/ BMCs that repopulated after 5-FU treatment contained about threefold more HSCs with the phenotype Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ 21 than their p53+/+ counterparts (Table 2).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Staining with anti-CD34 antibody discriminated two HSC subpopulations: Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/ (CD34low/, primitive HSCs) and Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+ (CD34high/+, multipotential HSCs).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	144	15 There was no difference in the percentage of CD34low/ cells between p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, the percentage of CD34high/+ cells was threefold to fourfold higher in the p53/ population.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	146	 No difference in the content of CD34high/+ and CD34low/ populations was observed in BMCs obtained from p53/ and p53+/+ mice not treated with 5-FU (data not shown).

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	148	To examine the role of p53 in the exhaustion of the HSC pool, 104 CD34low/ and CD34high/+ cells with the p53+/+ or p53/ genotype were plated in methylcellulose in the presence of KL, IL-3, and Epo.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	151	 p53 did not have any influence on lineage commitment and differentiation status of these cells, as indicated by morphological analysis of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospin preparations of cells used for each replating (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	152	 All types of colonies showed predominantly cells of myeloid origin.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Whereas the early 10-day cultures showed mainly myeloid precursors, the later 20- and 30-day cultures showed a preponderance of more mature myeloid cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, regardless of the origin and phenotype of the cells used to establish the cultures.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Consistent with the methylcellulose replating experiments, LTC-IC assay showed that 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs retained the ability to generate hematopoietic colonies for a longer time than the p53+/+ counterparts (Fig 6B).

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Thus, 105 BMCs obtained from p53/ and p53+/+ mice 6 days after 5-FU treatment were injected into TBI recipients and 12 days later CFU-S were scored.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	166	 A total of 105 BMCs harvested from the mice used to examine CFU-S formation were retransplanted into secondary TBI-treated recipients and pre-CFU-S were counted 12 days later.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	167	 p53 had only a moderate effect on the number of CFU-S formed by post-5-FU BMCs (Fig 6C).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Morphological analysis of the colonies showed no major differences.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Numerous large pre-CFU-S were formed by post-5-FU recovering p53/ BMCs in secondary recipients (Fig 6C), whereas p53+/+ marrow cells did not form classical pre-CFU-S, although numerous microscopic nodules of hematopoiesis were noted.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	170	 At low power, microscopy of p53/ pre-CFU-S showed large cellular nodules obliterating normal splenic architecture.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	171	 At high power, colonies composed of both erythroid and myeloid cells, with the latter showing partial inhibition of maturation, were evident.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In contrast, evaluation of the p53+/+ microscopic nodules showed an overall, preserved architecture of the spleen with small, but numerous, cellular aggregates.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	173	 High power view ( x 600) showed mixed hematopoietic cell populations with a preponderance of erythroid precursors and a smaller number of myeloid cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	174	 No difference in CFU-S- and pre-CFU-S-forming ability was found in p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs obtained from mice not treated with 5-FU (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	175	Together, the above results indicate that the absence of p53 is responsible for the increased number of HSCs and the decreased rate of exhaustion of the HSC pool after treatment with 5-FU.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	177	   Morphological analysis of p53+/+ and p53/ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment showed the presence of all major lineage-specific precursors for myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis, and lymphopoiesis (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Consistent with those findings, immunophenotyping analysis of these cell populations showed no statistically significant differences in the percentage of the following single-stained cell populations: B220+ and Ig+ cells (B lymphocytes and their precursors), CD3+ cells (T cells), TER-119+ cells (erythroid precursors), Mac-1 (myeloblasts and monocytes), F4/80+ (monocytes and macrophages), and Gr-1+ (granulocytes; data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These data suggest that the p53 status does not affect the differentiation of post-5-FU regenerating marrow cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	180	To analyze the effect of p53 on the proliferative potential of various lineage-specific precursors in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment, in vitro clonogenic assays were performed in the presence of several growth factors.

0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	187	The regeneration of mature blood cells after cytotoxic treatment results from the proliferative activity of a small number of HSCs that have a high, but limited, capacity for self-renewal.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	188	22,23 Despite much recent progress in identifying cytokines that regulate the proliferation of HSCs and lineage-specific descendants after cytoreductive therapy, the genetic mechanism responsible for the intrinsic control of self-renewal and differentiation of these cells remains largely undefined.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Increasing evidence points to the importance of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in regulating hematopoiesis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	190	2-7 Using marrow cells from p53 knockout and wild-type mice, we found that p53 can have a profound effect on the proliferation and exhaustion of HSCs as well as on the proliferation of lineage-specific precursors in bone marrow regenerating after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, p53 had no measurable effects on lineage determination and differentiation of these cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Nevertheless, this 5-FU-induced dysregulation of cell growth does not appear to lead to leukemia and is not translated into any altered output of mature blood cells or altered commitment to any specific blood cell lineage, at least during our period of observation (5 months).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our data also suggest that other regulatory mechanisms involving p16INK4a and WAF-1 may compensate the loss of function of p53.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The changes that occur in the stem cell population during the recovery from 5-FU treatment seem likely to reflect relevant physiological processes that are important during bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy procedures.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	195	Randall and Weissman24 reported that after 5-FU treatment, the number of HSCs (Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ Thy1.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	196	1low) in p53+/+ mice begins to increase on day 2, and approximately 50% of these cells are in S/G2/M phase on day 6.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Thus, BMCs for most of our studies were collected on day 6 after 5-FU injection.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The finding that fewer p53/ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment are required to rescue long-term hematopoiesis in TBI-treated recipient mice suggests that these cells contain more HSCs than their p53+/+ counterparts.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Indeed, the percentage of Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ cells, which are highly enriched with HSCs,21 was almost threefold higher in p53/ than in p53+/+ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	200	 No differences were observed in untreated mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	201	 However, the pool of HSCs can be subdivided into long-term reconstituting primitive HSCs (p-HSCs), with extensive self-renewal capacity, and transiently repopulating HSCs (t-HSCs) that only self-renew in mice for 3 to 6 weeks.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	202	25 Both populations are essential, at different times, for the rescue of hematopoiesis in TBI-treated animals.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Recently, the immunophenotype of both populations have been determined15 as Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34low/ (p-HSCs) and Lin Sca-1+ c-Kit+ CD34high/+ (t-HSCs).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	204	 We found that the percentage of p-HSCs in p53/ and p53+/+ BMC populations is similar after 5-FU administration and also in untreated mice (data not shown).
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	205	 However, 5-FU was responsible for an almost fourfold increase in the percentage of t-HSCs in p53/ BMCs as compared with p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thus, it seems likely that the long-term repopulating capacity of 5-FU-treated p53/ BMCs results from the increased content of t-HSCs, which are essential for hematopoietic recovery during the critical initial weeks after transplantation until the p-HSC descendants become the major source of long-term hematopoiesis.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Moreover, p53/ mice contained five to eight times more BMCs than did p53+/+ mice, so that at 6 days after 5-FU treatment the number of p-HSCs and t-HSCs were five to eight times and 20 to 32 times higher, respectively, in the p53/ mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Bone marrows in long-term reconstituted animals transplanted with a 1:1 mixture of p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs regenerating after 5-FU contained 90% to 99% of p53/ cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Thus, even if the percentage of p-HSCs is similar in 5-FU-treated p53/ and p53+/+ mice, the long-term repopulating activity of the former cells is much higher, possibly because of the increased production of t-HSCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Apparently, p53 plays an important role in BMC regeneration after 5-FU treatment by controlling not only the total number of p-HSCs in the organism, but also the production of their early descendants, t-HSCs, which represent the "functional" subpopulation responsible for the actual repopulation.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	211	Because the increased production of t-HSCs may reduce the pool of p-HSCs, we investigated the role of p53 in the exhaustion of the HSC pool after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Unfortunately, we could not use the in vivo BMC serial retransplantation assay, because most of the mice transplanted with p53/ BMCs developed lymphomas after 5 to 6 months, consistent with previous observations.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	213	1,26 Therefore, we used an in vivo pre-CFU-S assay and in vitro LTC-IC and methylcellulose replating assays.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Although p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs after 5-FU treatment developed similar numbers of CFU-S only p53/ BMCs regenerated cells forming pre-CFU-S.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Thus, p53 expression facilitates the exhaustion of cells forming pre-CFU-S, which are believed to belong to the p-HSC pool.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	216	27 LTC-IC assay and methylcellulose replating assay confirmed the longer duration of colony-forming ability in p53/ than in p53+/+ HSCs regenerating after 5-FU.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In summary, both in vivo and in vitro assays showed that the absence of p53 in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment not only increases the pool of HSCs, but also delays their exhaustion.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The increase of the total number of p-HSCs in p53/ mice after 5-FU treatment may reflect the reduced sensitivity to apoptosis and increased proliferative capacity of p53/ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The quiescent state of most p-HSC28 may explain the absence of any difference in the percentage of these cells after 5-FU treatment.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In contrast, most t-HSCs may represent cycling cells and, because p53/ cells have a proliferative advantage, the total number as well as the percentage of those cells in BMCs regenerating after 5-FU treatment is increased in p53/ mice as compared with p53+/+ mice.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In accord with this hypothesis, p53/ BMCs recovering after 5-FU treatment displayed a much higher multilineage clonogenic activity in the presence of growth factors.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	222	 This effect appeared to rest in the proliferative advantage of p53/ cells rather than the different number of precursor cells, because immunophenotypic analysis showed no significant differences in the content of lineage-specific precursors in p53/ and p53+/+ BMCs.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is also possible that in the absence of p53, the production of t-HSCs from p-HSCs is increased by a different unknown mechanism.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	224	Our results suggest that p53 is a key regulator of the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells responsible for long- and short-term repopulation, whereas it does not affect lineage determination and differentiation of committed progenitor/precursor cells.
0.5222594.9531612.html.plaintext.txt	225	 These findings raise the possibility that the manipulation of p53 expression might delay the decline of HSCs that occurs after chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	4	Oxidants such as H2O2 play a role in the toxicity of certain DNA-damaging agents, a process that often involves the tumor suppressor p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	5	 H2O2 is rapidly degraded by catalase, which protects cells against oxidant injury.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To study the effect of catalase on apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, HepG2 cells were infected with adenovirus containing the cDNA of catalase (Ad-Cat).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Forty-eight hours after infection, catalase protein and activity was increased 7-10-fold compared with control cells infected with Ad-LacZ.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	8	 After treatment with Vp16 or mitomycin C, control cells underwent apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner; however, overexpression of catalase inhibited this apoptosis.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Basal levels as well as Vp16- or mitomycin C-stimulated levels of p53 and p21 protein were decreased in the catalase-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells; however, p53 mRNA levels were not decreased by catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There was no difference in p53 protein synthesis between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, pulse-chase experiments indicated that p53 protein degradation was enhanced in the catalase-overexpressing cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Proteasome inhibitors but not calpeptin prevented the catalase-mediated decrease of p53 content.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Whereas Vp16 increased, catalase overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid did not prevent the catalase-mediated down-regulation of p53 or phosphorylated p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These results demonstrate that catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in association with decreasing p53 phosphorylation; the latter may lead to an acceleration in the degradation of p53 protein by the proteasome complex.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This suggests that the level of catalase may play a critical role in cell-induced resistance to the effects of anti-cancer drugs which up-regulate p53.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	18	Many chemotherapeutic drugs, including Vp16 and mitomycin C, induce cells to undergo apoptosis through damage of nuclear DNA.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The activation of wild type p53, a major tumor suppressor protein, which is implicated in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis (1-3), has been reported to be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents (3, 4).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The increase in p53 levels after DNA damage results in large part from stabilization of the p53 protein against degradation, and accumulation of p53 occurs because of this increased protein stability in the presence of ongoing translation (4).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Acute overexpression of wild type p53 mediated by adenovirus facilitates the ability of DNA-damaging drugs to induce death of cancer and normal cells (5).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	22	 As a transcription factor, p53 protein enhances the transcription rate of several genes including p21WAF1, GADD45, and 14-3-3, which are genes involved in cell cycle arrest (6-8), and Bax, CD95, Noxa, PUMA, and p53AIP1, which are related to p53-dependent apoptosis (9-13).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	23	Studies in a variety of cell types have suggested that ROS formation may be directly related to the ability of DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis (14).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Other studies indicate that ROS are downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis (15, 16).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	25	 p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	26	 p53 results in apoptosis through a multi-step process, including the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes, the generation of ROS, and the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, leading to apoptosis (15).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	27	 There is also evidence that ROS could regulate apoptosis as a signal transmitter or mediator (16, 18, 19).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, other studies indicate that apoptosis can be induced in the absence of any detectable oxidative stress when cells are treated with VP-16 and cisplatin (20), and oxidative stress can inhibit apoptosis in human lymphoma cells (21).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	29	Catalase, an anti-oxidative enzyme, is able to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is an important ROS related to p53 activation.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	270	 This suggests that ROS, especially H2O2, might be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by these DNA-damaging drugs.

0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	277	 p53 gene status modulates the chemosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	278	 DNA damage induced by the DNA-damaging agents Vp16 or mitomycin C activates p53 mainly through protein modification events such as phosphorylation, which results in p53 protein stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein due to the decrease of its degradation (4) (Fig.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	279	 HepG2 cells transfected with a mutant p53 expression vector (HepG2-mtp53), which encodes a mutant p53 protein, decreasing wild type p53 function, are more resistant to Vp16-induced apoptosis than HepG2 cells transfected with empty vector (HepG2-neo) (Fig.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	280	 This indicates that apoptosis induced by Vp16 in HepG2 cells is p53-dependent.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	281	 HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase as mediated by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (Ad-Cat) show a lower level of basal or induced p53 protein than control (Ad-LacZ) cells.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Lowering of p53 levels is likely to be the mechanism whereby catalase overexpression protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agents, whereas the latter induce apoptosis by elevating p53 levels.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	283	 There are no differences in p53 mRNA levels between catalase-overexpressing cells and control cells with or without treatment by DNA-damaging agents, and the p53 mRNA level did not change after treatment with Vp16 even though p53 protein levels were strongly increased.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Thus, the decrease in p53 protein levels by catalase overexpression or the increase in p53 levels by treatment with Vp16 is due to posttranscriptional effects.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	285	 P21 is a downstream gene target of p53 and is regulated by p53 (27).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	286	 HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase also display a lower level of p21 protein than control cells either in the absence or presence of treatment with DNA-damaging agents.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Lower levels of p21 protein in the presence of catalase may reflect the lower levels of p53 protein in the presence of catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The results of synthesis experiments indicate that overexpression of catalase does not change the rate of p53 protein synthesis; however, pulse-chase experiments did reveal that p53 protein degradation was increased in cells infected with Ad-Cat compared with cells infected with Ad-LacZ.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	289	By adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, Johnson et al.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	290	 (17) find that cells sensitive to p53-mediated apoptosis produced ROS concomitantly with p53 overexpression, whereas cells resistant to p53 failed to produce ROS.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	291	 In sensitive cells, both ROS production and apoptosis were inhibited by antioxidant treatment.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	292	 These results suggest that p53 acts to regulate the intracellular redox state and induces apoptosis by a pathway that is dependent on ROS production (17).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In our experiments, removing H2O2 by expression of catalase causes the p53 protein level to decrease, and this is associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by Vp16 or mitomycin C.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	294	 This suggests that, at least in HepG2 cells, H2O2 regulates apoptosis by modulating p53 levels, and H2O2 acts upstream of p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	295	As a result of a high turnover rate, the p53 protein has a half-life of ~30-60 min and is maintained at low levels in normal proliferating cells (28).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	296	 In response to genotoxic stress or oncogenic signaling, p53 levels rapidly increase, mainly through protein stabilization.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	297	 An important regulator of the p53 level is MDM2, which possesses intrinsic E3 ligase activity and, thus, promotes p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via proteasome-mediated proteolysis (29).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Overexpression of catalase did increase p53 protein degradation, and the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG115 but not the calpain inhibitor calpeptin could partially block the p53 protein lowering caused by overexpression of catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	299	 This is consistent with the overall mechanism that catalase lowers p53 levels by accelerating p53 degradation.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	300	How overexpression of catalase specifically down-regulates p53 protein or enhances p53 turnover is not clear.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Because H2O2 is a specific substrate of catalase, catalase down-regulation of p53 protein would appear to involve some function or action of H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	302	 One hypothesis is the H2O2 may increase the level of phosphorylated p53 by stimulating certain protein kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of p53 or by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatases that convert pp53 to the less stable nonphosphorylated state.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Once p53 protein is phosphorylated, its half-life is increased, which causes p53 accumulation (30).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	304	 If ROS indeed modulate the actions of p53 kinases or p53 phosphatases, overexpression of catalase may decrease p53 accumulation by removing ROS such as H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Using a specific antibody for detecting phosphorylated p53 on serine 20, we found that overexpression of catalase did prevent phosphorylation of p53 induced by Vp16, and low levels of pp53 were associated with low levels of total p53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	306	 However, the general phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, did not prevent the effect of catalase on down-regulation of p53 or pp53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	307	 This suggests that catalase may inhibit activity of p53 kinases, which may be activated by H2O2.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Recent studies indicate that ROS such as H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p53 can be mediated in part by polo-like kinase-3 (30).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Further studies will be necessary on the effects of ROS and of catalase on the activities of protein kinases implicated in phosphorylation of p53 and on protein phosphatases implicated in the dephosphorylation of pp53.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Chromium and vanadate metals that can cause oxidative stress are believed to modulate p53 through H2O2 (31, 32).
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	311	 H2O2 may also cause certain modifications of the p53 protein structure, e.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	312	 thiol oxidation, such that the protein is not an effective substrate for proteolysis.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Such putative, stabilizing modifications would be prevented by rapid removal of H2O2 by catalase.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	314	In summary, these results demonstrate that catalase protects HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents in association with decreasing the level of pp53, which leads to accelerating the degradation of p53 protein.
0.57820463.12468545.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The level of catalase may therefore play an important role in cell-induced resistance to the effects of anti-cancer drugs by modulating the cellular levels of p53 and p53 targets such as p21.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	4	The p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates the transcription of regulatory genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We reported previously that overexpression of p202, an interferon-inducible negative regulator of cell growth, negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Now we identify the gene encoding p202 as one whose mRNA and protein expression decrease in cells following the expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, the levels of p202 also decrease after exposure of cells to ultra violet light, which correlate with increase in the levels of p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report that the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 to the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene contributes to the transcriptional repression of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, overexpression of p202 in cells induced to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis significantly delays this process, indicating that the negative regulation of the 202 gene by wild-type p53 is important to potentiate apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	10	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	11	The protein, p202, is an interferon (IFN)1-inducible phosphoprotein (52 kDa) whose ectopic expression in a variety of cell types retards proliferation (1-4).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Interestingly, the reduced basal levels of p202 (in consequence of the expression of antisense RNA to 202) in fibroblasts, under reduced serum condition, increase the susceptibility to apoptosis (5) and overexpression of p202 in Rat-1 cells inhibits c-myc-induced apoptosis (6).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Together, these observations support the notion that p202 participates in the regulation of apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, the molecular mechanism(s) remains to be identified.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	15	The p53 family genes include genes encoding p73, p63, and p53 (7).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The p53 tumor suppressor gene from the family continues to hold distinction as the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer (7-11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This has stimulated efforts to understand the function of this gene in normal and neoplastic state.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A large number of functions have been attributed to p53, including cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In human and rodent cells containing wild-type p53 genes, the p53 protein is induced by a variety of stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, oxidative stress, hypoxia, nucleotide depletion, and oncogenic expression.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Accumulated data suggest that the high frequency of p53 mutations in human cancer reflect the ability of this protein to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis (7-11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	21	The underlying mechanism of tumor suppressor activity of p53 resides in part in its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner (8, 10).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It has been reported that a substantial number of genes containing p53 binding site(s) are activated by p53 (8, 11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These include mdm2, p21, and gadd45.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	24	 p21 and gadd45 have been implicated in p53-mediated cell cycle regulation.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition to playing a role as a DNA binding-dependent activator, p53 has also been reported to negatively regulate the transcription of a number of genes (11), including those for presenilin (12), topoisomerase II (13, 14), map4 (15), hsp70 (16), and other viral and cellular promoters (17).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In contrast to the transcriptional activation by p53, no consensus sequence has been found in the promoters that are repressed by p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It was initially reported that only the promoters containing a TATA box are repressed by p53 (18).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, in at least two cases, it has been reported that the specific DNA binding of p53 in the regulatory region of these genes results in transcriptional repression (19, 20).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several studies have implicated a role for transcriptional repression in p53-dependent apoptosis (9, 11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, proteins such as BCL2 have been shown to inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional repression, whereas transactivation and G1 arrest functions remain unaffected (21).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Additionally, deletion of the proline-rich region (amino acids 60-90) in human p53, which contains five repeats of the PXXP motif (22), renders it defective at apoptosis induction and transrepression, but not transactivation (23-25).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	32	The observation that p202 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of p53 (26), coupled with the fact that a number of proteins that regulate p53 functions are in turn regulated by p53, led us to test if p53 regulates the expression of p202.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Here we report that the expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 results in a decrease in the 202 RNA and protein.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We show that p53 binds to a p53 DNA-binding consensus sequence present in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene in gel mobility shift assays.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Moreover, p53 represses the activity of a reporter gene, whose transcription is driven by the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Additionally, we demonstrate that overexpression of p202 significantly delays p53-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the decrease in p202 levels by wild-type p53 may be important for p53-induced apoptosis.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	108	 While incubation of these cells at 37  degrees C (the nonpermissive temperature) favors mutant conformation of p53, upon shift of cells to 32  degrees C (the permissive temperature) favors a wild-type conformation of p53 (33).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Using this cell system, we found that the expression of wild-type p53 significantly decreased the steady-state levels of the 202 RNA (Fig.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Moreover, the decrease in p202 levels was accompanied by an increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 levels.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	135	 1B), the IFN treatment of these cells at the permissive temperature resulted in only a moderate increase in p202 levels.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Together, these observations provide support to the idea that the expression of wild-type p53 negatively regulates the steady-state levels of the 202 RNA and protein in these cell lines.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It does not contain a TATA box (31, 32).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Therefore, to identify a potential mechanism(s) by which wild-type p53 regulates the expression of the 202 gene, we searched the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene for the presence of other cis-regulatory elements that are shown to be involved in p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of genes.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Our search revealed that the regulatory region of the 202 gene contains several cis-acting elements (Fig.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Interestingly, as shown in Table I, the two potential p53 DNA binding sites p53CS1 and p53CS2 in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene, like other known p53 DNA binding sites in other p53-responsive genes (37, 38), contain C(A/T)(T/A)G at the core of the ten base palindrome, which is important for the DNA binding activity of p53 (37, 38).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, as noted in Table I, these two potential p53 DNA binding sites in the 202 gene contain variations (in the case of p53CS1, 5 variations out of 20 nucleotides, and, in the case of p53CS2, 4 out of 20 nucleotides) from the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence (38).

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	182	Because the p53CS2 sequence in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene differs from the p53CS1 and the p53 consensus sequence (see Table I), we tested its ability to bind p53 in gel-shift assays.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	186	 However, the p53CS2 sequence bound to p53 weakly (compare lane 8 with lanes 2 and 5) and incubation with anti-p53 antibodies did not result in a significant supershift of p53-oligonucleotide complex (compare lane 9 with lanes 3 and 6).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thus, together, these experiments indicated that in these assays p53 can specifically bind to one of the two (p53CS1) p53 consensus sequence present in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene with an affinity comparable to that of p53 DNA binding consensus sequence.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	188	Because in nuclear extracts p53 is bound to other nuclear proteins, which could facilitate binding of p53 to an oligonucleotide, we tested if the recombinant purified p53 can bind to an oligonucleotide containing the p53CS1 sequence from the 202 gene.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These experiments, thus, clearly demonstrated that in gel mobility shift assays one of the two p53 DNA binding sites (p53CS1) present in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene can specifically bind to the recombinant purified p53 and p53 in nuclear extracts.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Therefore, these experiments provide further support to the idea that the specific DNA binding of p53 in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene may contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the 202 gene.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Therefore, we tested if coexpression of p300 with p53 affects p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202 gene.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	232	 To rule out the possibility that the lack of repression of the 202-luc reporter activity in the above experiments was due to the lack of expression of mutant p53, we used hdm2-luc reporter plasmid, which is shown to be weakly responsive to the expression of the above deletion mutant of p53 (25).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Consistent with an earlier report (25), the expression of this mutant of p53 weakly stimulated the activity of hdm2-luc reporter.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Thus, these experiments provide support to the idea that the transcriptional repression of the 202 gene by the wild-type p53 may be important for a rapid induction of p53-induced apoptosis.

0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	280	In the present study, we demonstrate that wild-type p53 negatively regulates the levels of p202 by repressing the transcription of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	281	 We used two approaches to investigate if the expression of wild-type p53 regulates the basal levels of p202.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In the first approach, we used two murine cell lines (AKR-2B and Val5) constitutively expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Upon incubation of these cell lines at the permissive temperature, which favors the wild-type conformation of p53, both the 202 RNA and protein levels decreased significantly (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	284	 As expected, the decrease in p202 levels was accompanied by an increase in the levels of p21WAF1/CIP1, a known transcriptional target of p53 (9, 10).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In the second approach, we exposed murine AKR-2B cells to UV-C light (which results in increase in p53 levels in these cells) to test if the physiological increase in p53 levels correlate with decrease in p202 levels.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We found that UV treatment of cells, which resulted in a decrease in the levels of p202 (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	287	 4), was correlated with increases in the levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The decrease was also evident at the 202 RNA levels (data not shown).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Thus, these two approaches revealed that increases in p53 levels are associated with decreases in p202 protein and mRNA, thus suggesting that p53 may negatively regulate p202 expression.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	290	Unlike the activation of gene expression, the mechanism of repression of gene expression by wild-type p53 is not well defined and p53 has been shown to repress transcription of genes by different mechanisms (11, 41, 42).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	291	 These mechanisms include: (i) the binding of p53 to the TATA-binding proteins, which are bound to the TATA containing promoters (11, 18); (ii) the recruitment of mSin3a and histone deacetylases by p53 to the gene promoter (41); (iii) the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 to the consensus sequence present in the regulatory region of genes (19, 20); and (iv) the interactions of p53 with other cis-acting elements, which include SP-1 (16), CCAAT (43), and AP-1 (44).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Because the 5'-flanking sequence of the 202 gene does not contain a TATA box (30, 31), it is conceivable that the mechanism(s) by which p53 represses the transcription of the 202 gene is independent of TATA-binding proteins (45-47).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Consistent with this prediction, we found that the expression of adenovirus-encoded E1A protein, which is shown to relieve p53-mediated transcriptional repression of genes by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (46), did not relieve p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202-luc reporter activity (data not shown).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	294	The presence of two potential p53 DNA binding sites (37, 38) in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene (Table I) prompted us to test if p53 regulates the expression of the 202 gene through the specific DNA binding.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	295	 These experiments revealed that: (i) one of the two potential p53 DNA binding site (p53CS1, Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	296	 2A) present in the 5'-regulatory region of the 202 gene specifically bound to p53 in gel-mobility shift assays (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	297	 2, C and D); (ii) in transient transfection assays, the expression of wild-type p53, but not various mutants of p53 (defective in the specific DNA binding activity), resulted in a decrease in the 202-luc reporter activity (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	298	 3); and (iii) site-directed mutagenesis of the p53CS1 sequence in the 202 gene or its deletion relieved p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202-luc reporter activity (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Thus, our observations are consistent with the possibility that the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 contributes to the transcriptional repression of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Therefore, the 202 gene joins the class of genes whose transcriptional repression by p53 depends on the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 (19, 20).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	301	Although our observation that point mutations in the p53CS1 site (or its deletion) in the 202 gene relieve p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202-luc activity provides support to the idea that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202 gene depends on the specific DNA binding activity of p53, our observations do not completely rule out the possibility that other mechanism(s), such as interactions of DNA-bound p53 with other transcription factors, also contribute to the regulation of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Because in addition to the p53 DNA-binding sites (p53CS1 and p53CS2), the 5'-flanking sequence of the 202 gene also contains other cis-acting elements, such as CCAAT enhancer, SP-1, and an AP-1-like site, shown to be involved in p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the genes (16, 43, 44), further work will be needed to identify the relative contributions of these cis-elements in p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202 gene.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	303	Curiously, the proline-rich region in human p53, which contains five PXXP motifs (where P represents proline and X any amino acid) (22), was found to be dispensable for transactivation and cell cycle arrest mediated by p53 (23-25).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, the proline-rich region was found to be necessary for transrepression and apoptosis mediated by p53 (24, 25).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Our observation that the expression of a deletion mutant of p53, lacking the proline-rich region (amino acids 62-91), was not able to repress the transcription of the 202 gene (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	306	 3E) raises the possibility that the mechanism(s) by which wild-type p53 negatively regulates the transcription of the 202 gene depends on the presence of PXXP motifs in p53.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Similar to the 202 gene, the requirement for the p53 proline-rich region was also demonstrated for the transcriptional regulation of the PIG3 gene (24).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	308	Our previous studies revealed that the decreased levels of p202 in fibroblasts increase the propensity of cells to undergo apoptosis (5).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Interestingly, in a recent study overexpression of p202 was found to inhibit c-myc-induced apoptosis in Rat-1 cells, which harbor a wild-type p53 (6).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Together, these observations support the notion that p202 participates in the regulation of apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Consistent with this notion, our observations provide additional evidence that the increased levels of p202 in Vm10 cells significantly delay p53-induced apoptosis (Fig.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Therefore, it is likely that the decrease in the basal endogenous levels of p202, after the physiological increases in the levels of wild-type p53, contribute to the potentiation of p53-induced apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Additionally, because p202 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of p53 (26) and other factors (for example, NF-B and E2F-1) (49, 50), with which p53 cooperates to induce apoptosis (48, 51), the transcriptional repression of the 202 gene by p53 may be part of an important cascade of events by which p53 induces apoptosis.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	314	 However, it remains to be seen how the decrease in the levels of p202 following the expression of wild-type p53 affect the activity of these other transcription factors.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	315	p53-mediated biological effects in cultured cells, which include the growth arrest and apoptosis, are shown to be dependent on the levels of p53 expressed, the type (for example UV or ionizing radiation exposure) and the extent of stress (different doses of UV), and the cell type (11, 23).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Therefore, it is conceivable that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of the 202 gene depends on these factors, and further work will be needed to examine these possibilities.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	317	The identification of the 202 gene as a p53-repressible gene in the present study provides a novel feedback mechanism by which p53 negatively regulates the expression of a negative regulator.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Our findings also raise the interesting possibility that the basal levels of p202 are negatively regulated by other signaling pathways whose activation ultimately results in an increase in the levels of p53 (7, 9, 11).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Notably, these pathways include activation of p53 by oncogenes.
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Consistent with this prediction, we note that p202 levels are negatively regulated by the adenovirus-encoded E1A oncogene (data not shown).
0.60746497.11013253.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Thus, our findings reported herein will serve as a basis to study the regulation of the basal levels of p202 by these cell growth regulatory pathways and to identify the functional role of p202 in these cell growth-regulatory processes.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	6	The ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the activities of a C-terminal truncated p53 mutant, p53-30, which can bind Mdm2 but is resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation was investigated.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The inhibitory function of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which can bind p53 but is defective in targeting p53 for degradation was also studied.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We have demonstrated that targeting p53 for degradation is the most effective way for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, we have also shown that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation function of p53 without targeting it for degradation, although Mdm2 releases the transrepression ability of p53 mainly by targeting it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The ability of Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 was linked to its ability to inhibit the transrepression but not the transactivation function of p53.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Germ line mutations of p53 were found in patients suffering from a cancer-prone syndrome, Li-Fraumani syndrome, illustrating the tumor suppression function of p53 in humans (2).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The increased incidence of tumors seen in p53 knock-out mice provided further supporting evidence that p53 is a tumor suppressor gene (3).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Biochemically p53 can bind to DNA and transactivate genes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Transcriptional target genes of p53 include p21cip1/waf1, GADD45, mdm2, IGF-BP3, bax, and PIGs (p53-inducible genes) (4).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Interestingly, it has also been reported that p53 can transrepress the expression of genes such as Bcl-2 and MAP4, which can inhibit p53-induced apoptosis (5, 6).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	19	 By contrast, far less is known about the transrepression function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In normal cells, the expression level of p53 is very low.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, in response to DNA damage or other stress signals, p53 levels rise, and the cells undergo G1 arrest or apoptosis (4, 7).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This necessitates the tight regulation of the expression level of the p53 protein in cells.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Such regulation is achieved mainly at the post-transcriptional level.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The cellular levels of p53 may also be regulated by Mdm2, one of its transcriptional target genes and arguably the most important cellular regulator of p53 identified so far.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mdm2 binds to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and inactivates the transactivation and transrepression function of p53 (8-10).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, the binding of Mdm2 to p53 can also target both wild-type and mutant p53 for degradation (11-13).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, p53 and Mdm2 form a very tight auto-regulation loop.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The importance of the negative regulation of Mdm2 on p53 was demonstrated genetically by the ability of p53 null mice to rescue the embryonic lethality of mdm2 null mice (14, 15).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Mutations in the DNA binding region of p53 result in the loss of p53 transcriptional activity and the reduced expression of Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This enables such DNA-binding defective mutants of p53 to have a longer half-life and be expressed at a higher level than that of the wild-type protein.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	31	 All these suggested that the ability to target p53 for degradation is probably the most important mechanism through which Mdm2 negatively regulates the function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	32	It is known that the transactivation function of p53 contributes to its apoptotic function, and the binding of Mdm2 to p53 can conceal the transactivation domain of p53 inhibiting its transactivation function.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, the observation made by Oren and co-workers (16) demonstrates that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation but not the apoptotic function of p53 in HeLa cells.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This suggests that inhibiting the transactivation function of p53 may not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition, there is increasing evidence to suggest that the apoptotic function of p53 can be uncoupled from its transactivation function but linked to its transrepression function (17-19).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus it may be possible that Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53 through its ability to inhibit the transrepression function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	37	 If so, would it require the degradation of p53 protein? Using the mutants of Mdm2 and p53 and studying their ability to inhibit or induce apoptosis, we investigated the mechanism through which Mdm2 might inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 and addressed the issue of whether targeting p53 for degradation is the only mechanism through which Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	73	Apoptosis Induced by p53-30 Is More Resistant to the Inhibition of Mdm2-- As a negative regulator of p53, Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation, transrepression, and apoptotic function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Studies shown recently suggested that suppressing the transactivation function of p53 is not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (16, 17).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	75	 However, the ability to target p53 for degradation provided an attractive mechanism to explain how Mdm2 could abolish the apoptotic function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To understand how Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53, we asked the question of whether targeting p53 for degradation is associated with the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	77	 To address this issue, we initially used a C-terminal truncated p53 mutant, p53-30, which induces apoptosis but is resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation (26, 27).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The effect of Mdm2 on the apoptotic function of p53 and its mutant, p53-30, was investigated by co-transfecting an mdm2-expressing plasmid into SAOS-2 cells that lack endogenous p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Apoptosis was identified by the characteristic fragmentation of DNA, revealing a DNA ladder (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	80	 To quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells in a transfected cell population, flow cytometry was used to gate the transfected cells that express a cell surface marker CD20.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The DNA content of the transfected cells, which were stained with propidium iodide, was then analyzed as described previously (23).

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	83	2% in transiently transfected SAOS-2 cells.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Transfected Mdm2 did not induce apoptosis when transfected on its own.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, when co-transfected with p53 it reduced the apoptotic population of cells to 14.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In contrast to wild-type p53, p53-30 was more resistant to the inhibitory effect of the same amount of Mdm2, and the percentage of transfected cells undergoing apoptosis remained at 30.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The amount of apoptosis induced by p53-I is 14.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The degree of resistance of p53-30 to the inhibition of Mdm2 is similar to a Mdm2-binding defective mutant of p53, p53-I.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	89	 By comparing the reduction by Mdm2 of the apoptosis induced by wild-type p53, p53-30, or p53-I, it is clear that the mutant p53, p53-30, is more resistant to the anti-apoptotic effects of Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The slightly lower percentage of apoptosis seen with p53-I was because of the slightly lower expression of p53-I in this case (see Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	91	 1C), which is cloned in the pcDNA3 vector, whereas wild-type p53 and p53-30 are in CMV-Bam-Neo vectors.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	101	 C, Mdm2 promotes the degradation of p53 but not p53-30 or p53-I.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	102	 1  microg of p53 (lanes 1 and 2), p53-30 (lanes 5 and 6) or p53-I (lanes 7 and 8) was transfected into SAOS-2 cells in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or presence (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) of 2.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	104	Recent studies have demonstrated that the Mdm2-p53 interaction is required to target p53 for degradation (11-13).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Furthermore, it was shown that the stability of p53 in tumor cells was not determined by mutation in p53 but by Mdm2 binding (27).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The anti-apoptotic effect of Mdm2 on wild-type p53 could be explained by the fact Mdm2 rapidly targets wild-type p53 for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Hence, it is possible that the reason why Mdm2 is unable to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 is because Mdm2 cannot target it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Consistent with this hypothesis and in agreement with the published results, the data in Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	109	 1C showed that p53-30 was indeed resistant to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation (lanes 5 and 6).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Under the same condition, however, co-transfection of mdm2 promoted the degradation of wild-type p53 (lanes 3 and 4).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In addition, similar levels of transfected Mdm2 were detected in cells expressing either wild-type p53 or p53 mutants, p53-30, and p53-I (lanes 4, 6, and 8).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Therefore, the results here show that whereas Mdm2 can target wild-type p53 for degradation, p53-30 remains more resistant to Mdm2-targeted degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, it seems that Mdm2-targeted degradation of p53 is associated with the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	114	Mdm2 Inhibits p53-induced Apoptosis Mainly by Targeting It for Degradation-- To further investigate the hypothesis that the ability of Mdm2 to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis is directly linked to its ability to target p53 for degradation, we studied the anti-apoptotic function of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	115	 This mutant can bind to p53 but cannot target p53 for degradation (12, 20).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	116	 On one hand, this Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437) was shown previously to be able to inhibit p53-induced apoptosis (20).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	117	 On the other hand, it was shown recently that the mutant Mdm2, Mdm2-(222-437) is more stable than the wild-type Mdm2 (28).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Therefore, it is possible that Mdm2-(222-437) is much less active in inhibiting the apoptosis induced by p53 than that of the wild-type Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	119	 To address this hypothesis, a titration of 10 and 20  microg of mdm2 and 3 and 6  microg of mdm2-(222-437) expression plasmids was performed.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Similar expression levels of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) were obtained when 10  microg of wild-type mdm2 (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	121	 2, top panel, lanes 2 and 7) and 3  microg of mdm2-(222-437) expression plasmids (middle panel, lanes 4 and 9) were used in the transfection experiment.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The corresponding ratios of mdm2 and its mutant were then co-expressed with p53 or p53-30.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	123	 As predicted, the co-expression of mdm2 caused the degradation of wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	124	 2A, lower panel, lanes 1-3) but not p53-30 (lower panel, lanes 6-8).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In addition, co-expression of the Mdm2 mutant, mdm2-(222-437), did not cause any degradation of either wild-type p53 or p53-30 (lower panel, lanes 1, 4 and 5 for wild-type p53 and lanes 6, 9 and 10 for p53-30).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Under these conditions, the ability of wild-type Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) to inhibit the apoptosis induced by p53 and p53-30 were then compared, and the result is shown in Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The expression of wild-type Mdm2 clearly reduced the sub-G1 population as quantified by flow cytometry in wild-type p53 transfected SAOS-2 cells (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, under this condition the Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), only showed a small inhibition of the apoptosis induced by p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This result suggested that Mdm2-(222-437) is less effective than wild-type Mdm2 in inhibiting p53-induced apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Again the apoptosis induced by p53-30 was more resistant to the inhibition by Mdm2.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	140	Mdm2 Can Inhibit the Transactivation Function of p53 without Targeting It for Degradation-- So far, we have demonstrated that Mdm2 needs to bind p53 to inhibit its apoptotic function, but binding alone is not sufficient; both the Mdm2-binding defective p53 mutant p53-I and p53-30, which can bind Mdm2, were unable to be effectively inhibited by Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Recently it was suggested that Mdm2 binds less efficiently to p53-30 than to wild-type p53 in vitro (29).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This could be the reason why p53-30 is more resistant to the inhibition of Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	143	 To test this hypothesis, instead of using a binding assay, we decided to assay the transcriptional activity of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	144	 If the Mdm2 binds to p53, its transcriptional activity will be inhibited since it is known that Mdm2 binds to the transactivation domain of p53 and abolishes its transactivation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In the case of wild-type p53 however, Mdm2 also targets it for degradation, and this complicates the issue.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	146	 So by using p53 mutants that are unable to be targeted for degradation or Mdm2 mutants unable to target p53 for degradation in our assay, it allows us to investigate whether Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation of p53 without targeting it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Hence, we could then further investigate whether the inability of Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 was because of the fact that p53-30 was resistant to Mdm2 inhibition of its transactivation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	148	To address these issues, we initially examined the expression levels of the well known p53 target p21waf1 in a set of cell lysates derived from a FACS analysis experiment as shown in Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	149	 3, the transactivation function of p53 is evident as there is a clear elevation of the levels of endogenous p21waf1 protein when either p53, p5330, or p53I is transfected in p53-null SAOS-2 cells (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This data also showed that although Mdm2 failed to effectively inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	151	 1B), it reduced the p53-30-dependent induction of p21waf1 (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In contrast to the effect of Mdm2 on wild-type p53 where it targets p53 for degradation (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	153	 3, lanes 4-5), Mdm2 reduced the induction of p21waf1 by p53-30 without targeting it for degradation (lanes 6-7) and did not affect the induction of p21waf1 by p53-I (lanes 8-9).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These observations together would argue that Mdm2 must be able to inhibit the transactivation function of p53 by binding to p53 without the need to target it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Importantly, this also suggested that the transactivation function of p53 could be uncoupled from its apoptotic ability, because Mdm2 cannot effectively inhibit the apoptotic function of p53-30 but inhibits its ability to transactivate target gene p21waf1.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We chose the mdm2 promoter as it is widely used to measure the transactivation activity of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	169	 For this transactivation assay, we used amounts of protein proportional to the amounts used in the flow cytometric experiments and used the Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which is unable to target p53 for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Thus the transactivation data correlates with that of flow cytometric and Western blotting data shown.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The transactivation function of both wild-type p53 and p53-30 was inhibited by the co-expression of Mdm2 or its mutant, Mdm2-(222-437).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In contrast, Mdm2 or its mutant Mdm2-(222-437) failed to inhibit the transactivation function of p53-I, which is unable to bind Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	174	Thus, by using a mutant of Mdm2, Mdm2-(222-437), we are able to demonstrate that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation of p53 without targeting it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The results also demonstrated that Mdm2 and its mutant Mdm2-(222-437) inhibited the transactivation of p53-30 to a similar degree as that of wild-type p53 on the mdm2 promoter but did not inhibit the transactivation function of a Mdm2-binding defective p53 mutant p53-I.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	176	 These observations thus suggest that both Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) were able to bind both p53 and p53-30 to inhibit their transactivation functions on the mdm2 promoter.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Taking into account the earlier observation that Mdm2 is defective in inhibiting the apoptosis induced by p53-30 but not wild-type p53 (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	178	 1), this would argue that inhibiting p53 transactivation function is not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	179	Mdm2 Releases the Transrepression Function of p53 Mainly by Targeting It for Degradation and This Correlates with Inhibition of Apoptosis-- Recent data suggested that the apoptotic function of p53 was best linked to its transrepression function (17-19).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, very few genes have been identified as the targets to be specifically repressed by p53 during apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	181	 How p53 transrepresses gene expression is also not known because p53 can transrepress many promoters that do not contain p53 binding sites (4).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Also not known are the mechanisms by which Mdm2 inhibits the transrepression function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Nevertheless, to be able to target p53 for degradation provided a simple explanation of how Mdm2 might achieve this.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	184	 To ascertain whether this paradigm might apply here, we performed an assay to test the effect of Mdm2 and Mdm2-(222-437) on the transrepression function of wild-type p53 and p53-30.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	185	It is known that p53 can transrepress promoters of c-fos and large T antigen of SV40 DNA tumor virus (30, 31).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Hence, to monitor the transrepression ability of p53, we co-transfected a -galactosidase reporter linked to the SV40 promoter and determined the extent of p53 transrepression by measuring the -galactosidase activity in the same population of cells as that used in one of the FACS analysis experiments (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	187	 1B) using the same lysate as that used in Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	188	 4A, there is a clear correlation between the ability of p53, p53-30, and p53-I to induce apoptosis (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	189	 1B), and their abilities to transrepress genes as determined by this assay.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Furthermore, the ability of Mdm2 to reduce apoptosis induced by p53 correlates with a relief of p53-mediated repression and targeted degradation by Mdm2; in addition, the inability of Mdm2 to reduce apoptosis and its inability to inhibit the transrepression by p53-30 also correlated with its incapability to target it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Furthermore, the failure of Mdm2 to affect p53-I in terms of apoptosis and transrepression is consistent with the inability of Mdm2 to bind p53-I.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	205	 It was evident that in our assay, Mdm2 was clearly able to inhibit p53-mediated repression of the SV40 promoter (Fig.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These together demonstrate that targeting p53 for degradation remains the most effective way for Mdm2 to produce the full inhibition of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In addition, the data also argues that there is a link between the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis and its ability to exhibit transrepression as determined by this assay.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	212	One of the major criticisms of this transrepression assay, which measures the decrease in reporter activity, is that reduction in activity could be a consequence of cell death and hence not specific to p53-induced apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	213	 To address this issue, we used a truncated mutant of E2F1, E2F1-(1-374), which is transcriptionally incompetent (thus cell-cycle independent) but is able to induce p53-independent apoptosis in SAOS-2 cells (23).

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	215	 What is particularly interesting is that using similar proportions of plasmids in transrepression assays done in parallel shows that E2F1-(1-374) does not exhibit transrepression of SV40-lacZ (Fig.

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Hence, transrepression appears to correlate with apoptosis induced by p53 but not by E2F1-(1-374), which can induce apoptosis independent of p53 in SAOS-2 cells (23, 32).

0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	219	The physical and functional interaction of p53 with Mdm2 has long been known to be involved in the negative feedback loop involving the two proteins.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	220	 We have demonstrated here that whereas p53-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by Mdm2, a p53 mutant p53-30 remained more resistant to the inhibition by Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The inhibition of apoptosis and the targeting of p53 for degradation by Mdm2 were dependent on binding to p53; Mdm2 did not target p53-I, which was unable to bind Mdm2, for degradation and hence was also unable to inhibit its apoptotic and transrepression functions.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	222	 However, binding alone was not sufficient for Mdm2 to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 and to target p53 for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The p53 mutant p53-30 somehow was more resistant to the negative regulation of Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The observation that p53-30 was unable to be targeted for degradation by Mdm2 in a similar manner as wild-type p53 agrees that of Kubbutat et al.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This was also consistent with the previous observation in an inducible cell system that high levels of p53 expression were required for its apoptotic function (20).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Thus targeting p53 for degradation would be the main mechanism through which Mdm2 inhibits the apoptotic function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Corroborating this notion, we observed that the inhibitory activity of an Mdm2 mutant, Mdm2-(222-437), which can bind p53 but is defective in targeting p53 for degradation, was not as effective as wild-type Mdm2 in inhibiting the apoptotic function of p53 when expressed at similar levels.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	228	 However the mutant of Mdm2, Mdm-2(222-437), had been previously shown to inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (20).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	229	 One explanation, which may account for this discrepancy between the data shown here and the one reported previously, may be because of the difference in the expression level of this Mdm2 mutant.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In support of this idea, it was previously reported that this Mdm2 mutant is very stable (28).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	231	 When the same amounts of wild-type and mutant Mdm2 expressing plasmid DNA were transfected to the cells, the expression level of the mutant Mdm2 can be five times higher than that of the wild-type Mdm2.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Under such conditions, the overexpressed mutant Mdm2 can then inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 (data not shown).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Therefore, it is possible that Mdm2 may inhibit the apoptotic function of p53 by some other mechanism when largely overexpressed.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This may account for the modest inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis by the Mdm2 mutant (Fig.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Nevertheless, targeting p53 for degradation remains the most efficient way for Mdm2 to inhibit the activities of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	236	Binding to the transactivation domain of p53, Mdm2 is known to inhibit the transactivation and transrepression function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Using mutants of p53 and Mdm2, p53-30, and Mdm2-(222-437), respectively, both of which are defective in Mdm2-mediated protein degradation of p53, allowed us to investigate whether the anti-apoptotic function of Mdm2 is linked to its ability to inhibit the transactivation or the transrepression function of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We observed that Mdm2 inhibited p53- and p53-30-dependent induction of endogenous p21waf1 in the same populations of cells that were used in the FACS assays.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This demonstrates that Mdm2 can inhibit the transactivation function of p53-30 without targeting it for degradation or abrogating its apoptotic function.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This was further corroborated in transactivation assays showing that Mdm2 was able to inhibit the transactivation function of p53-30 on the mdm2 promoter as effectively as that of wild-type p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This result demonstrates that the capacity of Mdm2 to inhibit the transactivation function of p53 could be uncoupled from its ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	242	Our data shown here suggests that Mdm2 may release the transrepression function of p53 by targeting it for degradation.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	243	 It also demonstrates that there is a link between the apoptotic activity of p53 and its ability to transrepress gene expression.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Consistent with this, similar observations have been reported previously during a screen of p53 mutants (18) and a study of the regulation of p53-induced apoptosis by Rb (17).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, the major criticism for suggesting a link between apoptosis and transrepression abilities of p53 was that repression could be a consequence of cell death.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	246	 In this report, we specifically addressed this issue and showed that transrepression of the SV40 promoter only occurred during apoptosis induced by p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	247	 E2F1-(1-374) is an E2F1 mutant which is unable to transactivate genes, yet it can induce apoptosis independently of p53 in SAOS-2 cells (23).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Under the same conditions, the E2F1 mutant, E2F1-(1-374) could induce apoptosis to levels comparable with or in excess of p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	249	 However, this E2F1 mutant did not exhibit transrepression at the time point tested, whereas p53 repressed the reporter in the assay.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This suggested that the transrepression and apoptosis link is specific to p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Indeed, there are a number of anti-apoptotic genes that have been reported to be transrepressed by p53.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Among them, the expression of bcl-2 and MAP4 were able to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53 (5, 6).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Recently it was also reported that p53 can act as a general repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription (34).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	254	 To be able to bind to Sin3 and inhibit the general transcription by the histone deacetylase pathway provided another line of evidence to support the hypothesis that p53 could be a general repressor of many other genes (33).
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	255	 It remains to be elucidated whether p53 is a specific repressor of certain genes or a general repressor of transcription.
0.73248696.10980197.html.plaintext.txt	256	 The unraveling of the molecular mechanisms of how p53 transrepresses gene expression will provide more conclusive evidence to address whether the transrepression ability of p53 is indeed responsible for inducing apoptosis or whether it is triggered by the onset of p53-induced apoptosis.

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In order to understand which structural features in DNA the C-teminal domain recognises we have studied the interaction of p53 protein with different types of DNA oligonucleotides imitating damaged DNA.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here we show that one unpaired nucleotide within double-stranded (ds)DNA is sufficient for recognition by the p53 C-terminus, either as a protruding end or as an internal gap in dsDNA.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	7	 C-terminal interaction with DNA ends facilitated core domain binding to DNA, whereas interaction with gaps prevented core domain to DNA complexing, implying that p53 might adopt distinct conformations upon binding to different DNA lesions.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These observations suggest that both single-strand and double-strand breaks can serve as a target for p53 C-terminal recognition in vivo and indicate that p53 might recruit different repair factors to the sites of damaged DNA depending on the type of lesion.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumour suppressor protein p53 becomes activated in cells under various stress conditions, including DNA damage induced by ionising radiation, UV or chemical agents, hypoxia, oncogene activation and others (reviewed in 1).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Induced p53 triggers growth arrest or cell death by apoptosis via transcriptional activation of a set of genes containing the consensus p53 binding site and transcriptional repression of another set of genes.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In this manner, p53 serves as a gatekeeper which prevents propagation of cells that are at risk of aquiring tumourigenic mutations.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	12	Accumulating in vitro and in vivo data suggest that p53 might also function as a caretaker, preserving genomic integrity by regulating DNA repair (for a review see 2).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Loss of p53 function leads to the deregulation of DNA repair and causes gross structural changes in the genome.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For instance, cells from various organs of 4 to 6-week-old p53 null mice display aneuploidy and frequent gene amplification, suggesting inefficeint DNA repair in the absence of p53 (3).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Mutations in p53 were statistically correlated with the replication error phenotype in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (4).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition, it was recently found that p53 is able to reduce the frequency of chemically induced point mutations (5).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Disruption of p53 function in some systems resulted in a deficiency in the rate and extent of nucleotide excision repair (NER) (5 to 7).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	18	It appears that p53 can facilitate DNA repair due to different activities.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	19	 p53 up-regulates transcription of GADD45, xeroderma pigmentosum gene p48 and a rate limiting factor in DNA repair ribonucleotide reductase (8 to 11).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	20	 There is also evidence that p53 modulates DNA repair in a transcription-independent way (12,13).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It is possible that p53 can participate in DNA repair processes directly via its ability to bind damaged DNA and to interact with several components of the excisional and recombinational repair mashinery, including XPD, XPB, RPA and RAD51 (14 to 16).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	22	DNA strand breaks appear to be sufficient to trigger p53 activation in cells and p53 induction is temporally correlated with the appearance of DNA breaks (17,18).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Induction of p53 in response to, for instance, DNA damage appears to involve activation of specific DNA binding by the core domain along with protein accumulation (19).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Short single-stranded (ss)DNA oligonucleotides added in trans can stimulate sequence-specific binding of the p53 core domain in vitro, indicating that recognition of DNA lesions by the p53 C-terminus might trigger p53 activation in vivo (20,21).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	25	The ability of the C-terminal domain of p53 to bind ssDNA ends (22,23), insertion/deletion mismatches (24), recombination intermediates (25) and -irradiated DNA in vitro (26) implies that p53 could recognise DNA damage and/or DNA repair intermediates in vivo.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In line with this notion are confocal microscopy studies that demonstrated co-localisation of p53 with sites of damaged DNA in human skin exposed to UV irradiation (27).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	27	 p53 was also shown to enhance the rejoining of non-homologous DNA ends in living cells in a C-terminal-dependent and transactivation-independent manner (12).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Taken together, these observations hint at involvement of the direct recognition of DNA lesions by p53 in exertion of the p53  guardian of the genome  function.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, the role of DNA damage intermediates in the p53 response is only starting to emerge (28).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	30	In the present study we show that the p53 C-terminal domain binds both staggered ends and gaps of different length within double-stranded oligonucleotides, whereas the core domain did not recognise the single-stranded stretch in protruding ends or gaps.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	31	 C-terminal domain complexing with DNA ends facilitated the core domain interaction with the same DNA molecule.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In contrast, C-terminal interaction with gaps blocked DNA binding by the core.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our findings provide new insights into the possible biological consequences of p53 interaction with different types of DNA lesions.

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	54	 dsDNA breaks with staggered or, less frequently, blunt DNA ends occur in cells exposed to ionising radiation (30).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	55	 ssDNA gaps can be generated as a consequence of NER or mismatch repair (31,32) or replicational bypass of a DNA lesion (33).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	56	 We addressed the question of whether p53 is able to recognise DNA lesions such as single-strand gaps.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	57	We analysed the interaction between the double-strand oligonucleotides with different structure and recombinant p53 protein produced in Sf9 insect cells in a band shift assay, as previously described (21).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Unlabelled 29mer or 30mer dsDNA oligonucleotides were used as competitors for p53 binding to the labelled ssDNA oligonucleotide NGC: the blunt end double-strand oligonucleotide MNGC and the double-strand MNG1, MNG2 and MNG8 oligonucleotides which have the same sequence as MNGC, but contain 1, 2 and 8 nt internal gaps, respectively (Table 1).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	59	In accordance with our previous results (21), p53 formed a complex with the single-strand probe via its C-terminus (complex I, Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	60	 1A, lane 1), as verified by competition with ssDNA, but not dsDNA (NGC versus MNGC, Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	61	 1A, lanes 10 and 11 versus 2 and 3, respectively).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Gap-containing oligonucleotides MNG1, MNG2 and MNG8 (Table 1) competed efficiently with the single-strand probe for binding to p53 (Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	63	 MNG8 was an even more efficient competitor than NGC itself in this assay (compare lanes 8 and 10).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In Figure 1B binding of the isolated p53 C-terminal domain, GST to p53(320 to 393) protein, to the labelled MNG8 probe is shown.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Interestingly, the interaction with MNG8 is inhibited by PAb421 antibody when used at high concentrations (Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	66	 4B, lanes 11 and 12, 200 and 300 ng, respectively).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	67	 This probably occurs because the DNA binding basic region (residues 363 to 372) overlaps the PAb421 epitope (residues 372 to 382).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Control antibody PAb1801, which recognises N-terminal residues 46 to 55 in p53, did not affect complex formation.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The C-terminus to MNG8 complex was supershifted by anti-GST antibody, demonstrating involvement of the p53 fusion protein in complex formation.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	70	 From these experiments we conclude that the p53 C-terminal domain can recognise gaps in dsDNA.

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Similar to the absence of a supershift of complexes between the p53 C-terminus and single-stranded or gap-containing DNA, the addition of either PAb421 or PAb1801 p53-specific antibodies did not supershift p53 complexes with staggered end probes (Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	131	 4A, lanes 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	132	Notably, formation of PAb421-induced complex IV via the core domain was facilitated by the presence of protruding ends on a labelled probe.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The efficiency of complex formation was significantly increased with increasing length of the protruding ends of a labelled probe (Fig.

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Therefore, the increased binding to staggered end DNA probes via the core domain should be attributable to the C-teminal interaction with protruding ends.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	140	We have compared the binding of p53 to double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a consensus p53 binding site with blunt (BC) or staggered (OBC) ends (see Table 1).

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The effect was PAb421 independent, since it was observed in its absence.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The specificity of binding was verified by competition assay (data not shown).

0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In the present study we examined the ability of p53 to interact with DNA oligonucleotides mimicking damaged DNA.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Our results demonstrate that the p53 C-terminus can recognise protruding ssDNA ends as short as 1 nt.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	184	 p53 did not discriminate between 3' and 5' DNA ends, since no difference in binding to double-stranded MN oligonucleotides with protruding 3' or 5' DNA ends was observed in band shift assays (data not shown).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In addition, our previous electron microscopy experiments allowed visualisation of p53 bound to both ends of a single-strand oligonucleotide (21).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	186	Moreover, we show that p53 can bind internal single-strand gaps in dsDNA as short as 1 nt.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Interaction with single-strand gaps, similar to ssDNA end recognition, was mediated by the C-terminal domain, whereas the core domain bound neither gaps nor ssDNA ends.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Although a 1 nt gap was recognised by p53, interaction with longer gaps was more efficient.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	189	What is the common structural component that is present in DNA substrates recognised by the p53 C-terminal domain? Data presented in this study indicate that p53 might recognise a distortion of the normal geometry of DNA, i.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	190	 phosphate backbone deformation (an altered angle and/or spacing between phosphates) within regions of DNA lesions.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The observation that the p53 C-terminal domain is able to bind even one protruding/unpaired nucleotide in dsDNA indicates the high potential of DNA lesion recognition by p53.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	192	More than one p53 to DNA complex formed via the C-terminal domain was observed on band shift gels.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This might reflect the different oligomeric state of p53 (mono-, di- or tetrameric) in these complexes.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Alternatively, more than one DNA molecule could be involved in the p53 tetramer to DNA complex.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Further studies are required to define the nature of different C-terminus to DNA complexes.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	196	The presence of the protruding ends on double-stranded probes enhanced DNA binding via the core domain (Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The efficiency of core domain DNA binding increased with increasing length of the protruding ends.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Since the presence of staggered ends on DNA did not affect binding of the isolated core domain, the effect appears to be entirely C-terminus dependent.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Furthermore, here we provide evidence that the C-terminal and core domains can bind one DNA molecule simultaneously.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	200	The interrelationship between the two p53 DNA binding domains is a subject of ongoing discussion.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	201	 According to the reciprocal interference model DNA binding by the C-terminal and core domains is mutually exclusive, whereas the allosteric model does not rule out the possibility of simultaneous binding of both domains to DNA (35 to 37).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	202	The results presented in this study argue that C-terminal and core domain binding to DNA is not mutually exclusive.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	203	 First, our experiments show that probes containing binding sites for both the C-terminal and core domains (for instance, OBC versus BC oligonucleotide) were the best substrates for p53 DNA binding via the core domain.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Second, we observed competition of the MN1 to p53 core domain complex by oligonucleotides containing C-terminal binding sites.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Notably, not all of the C-terminal target oligonucleotides competed, only those which could bind the core domain as well (staggered end oligonucleotides); single-stranded NGC and gap-containing MNG8 DNA, which did not bind the core, did not compete (Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Such selective competition argues that both domains can interact with the same DNA molecule (model shown in Fig.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	207	Simultaneous binding of both domains to DNA might have a cooperative effect.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This notion is consistent with the model proposed by Nagaich et al.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Comparison of the p53 to DNA complexes demonstrated that DNA bending and twisting angles are significantly larger in the full-length p53 to DNA complex than in the core domain to DNA complex.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This implies that the p53 domain(s) flanking the DNA binding region, in particluar the C-terminal domain, is also involved in complexing with specific DNA (38).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	211	 C-termini located on the concave surface of bent DNA might facilitate bending of the DNA and thus enhance interaction with the core domain.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This arrangement may be advantageous for stabilisation of the entire protein to DNA complex.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The co-crystal structure of full-length p53 protein in a complex with DNA will be required to give a definite answer as to the contribution of the C-terminal domain to DNA complexing by the core domain.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	214	What could be the biological significance of p53 interaction with DNA ends? It was recently reported that p53 enhances the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand break (DSB) repair in vivo (12).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	215	 NHEJ appears to be a major DSB repair pathway in higher eukaryotes during the G0, G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle (39).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	216	 DSB repair through homologous recombination, in contrast, operates mainly in the late S, G2 and M phases, when sister chromatids are positioned optimally for homologous crossover.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	217	 This is probably because during other stages of the cell cycle a high probability of homologous recombination between non-homologous chromosomes exists, due to the presence of repetitive sequences, representing a substantial fraction of the genome (for a review see 39).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	218	 p53 was shown to suppress homologous recombination in vivo.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	219	 In the absence of wild-type p53 function increased rates of homologous recombination were observed, leading to intra- and interchromosomal translocations, gene conversions and deletions (40 to 43).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Taken together, these data suggest that by controlling recombinational repair via suppression of homologous recombination and enhancement of the NHEJ pathway, p53 might prevent chromosomal aberrations, thus maintaining the integrity of the genome.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	221	The molecular mechanism underlying the control of recombinational repair by p53 is presently unknown.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	222	 It was shown that enhancement of rejoining of DSBs was C-terminus dependent, but transcription activation independent (12).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In addition, blunt end rejoining was facilitated by p53 much less efficiently than protruding end rejoining.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These results are in line with our in vitro data showing that the C-terminus bound protruding DNA ends more efficiently than blunt ends.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The findings presented here imply that p53 might mediate NHEJ through direct binding to protruding DNA ends.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	226	It was suggested that p53 might facilitate the initial stages of DNA repair in a transcription-independent manner, probably through protein to protein interactions (7).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The ability to interact with gapped DNA might provide the basis for a possible role of p53 as a recruitment factor in NER, especially when taking into consideration the ability of p53 to bind to NER helicases XPB, XPD and CSB (14).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This notion is bolstered by the observation that p53 co-localised with sites of gapped DNA produced during NER after UV irradiation in living cells (C.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	229	Milner, personal communication).
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	230	The ability of p53 to interact with ssDNA ends and gaps suggests that both single-strand breaks (SSBs) and DSBs might serve as targets for the p53 C-terminus interaction in vivo.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Notably, C-terminus interaction with DNA ends facilitated core domain binding to DNA, whereas interaction with gaps prevented the core domain to DNA interaction.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This implies a different mutual positioning of p53 domains upon binding to SSBs versus DSBs.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus, it is conceivable that p53 can recruit different repair factors depending on availability of its domains upon binding to different types of lesions.
0.50851667.11024181.html.plaintext.txt	234	 In the future it will be essential to learn how p53 interacts with excision/recombinational repair factors upon binding to DNA ends and gaps.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	4	 p53 DNA binding properties are regulated by several factors, such as post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and acetylation, regulation by its own C-terminal domain and interactions with other cellular proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Substrates resembling Holliday junctions and extra base bulges were used to study the effect of three nuclear proteins, HMG-1, HMG I(Y) and hMSH2 to hMSH6, on the lesion binding properties of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Gel retardation assays revealed that the three proteins had varying effects on p53 binding to these substrates.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	7	 HMG-1 did not influence p53 binding to Holliday junctions or 3-cytosine bulges.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HMG I(Y) rapidly dissociated p53 complexes with Holliday junctions but not 3-cytosine bulges.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, the mismatch repair protein complex, hMSH2 to hMSH6, enhanced p53 binding to both substrates by 3 to 4-fold.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Together, these results demonstrate that p53 DNA binding activity is highly influenced by the presence of other proteins, some having a dominant effect while others have a negative effect.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   p53 is a key cell cycle checkpoint factor which causes cells to undergo either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis following DNA damage.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	12	 When cells are exposed to UV and X irradiation, there is an accumulation and activation of p53 (reviewed in 1 to 3) which results in the downstream transactivation of several genes whose products assist in the maintenance of genomic integrity (4,5).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, the exact mechanism of p53 activation following DNA damage is not clear.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation appear to play an important role in this process (6,7).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Additionally, the transcriptional response of p53 requires tetramerization and this could be influenced by several factors (8).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Finally, p53 activity could be altered by interactions with other proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Indeed, p53 has been shown to associate in vitro and in vivo with a number of proteins involved in DNA metabolic processes such as repair [XPB, XPD (9) and WRN (10)], replication [DNA polymerase (11) and RPA (12)] and recombination [hRad51 (13)].
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	18	Although the p53 response to DNA damage is largely mediated by downstream proteins, there is increasing evidence that p53 can directly interact with DNA lesions.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	19	 p53 can bind single strand and double strand breaks (14), three-stranded DNA structures (15,16), extra base bulges (17) and several base/base mismatches in DNA (18).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Additionally, we have shown that p53 binds with extremely high affinity to Holliday junctions (16).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	21	 All of these lesions occur as a result of typical recombination, replication and repair processes as well as DNA damage caused by environmental factors.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For example, Holliday junctions are natural intermediates of homologous recombination; however, high levels of sister chromatid exchange following irradiation suggests the formation of these structures due to DNA damage (19).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Replication of molecules containing thymidine dimers could result in the insertion of additional nucleotides opposite the existing lesion.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Additionally, when two similar DNA molecules with a few non-identical bases undergo recombination, regions of extra base bulges and mismatches can be left behind.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Replication errors can also lead to the generation of mismatches and extra base bulges in DNA.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	26	 All of these lesions need to be repaired for cell cycle progression to occur.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The high affinity of p53 to several of these lesions strongly points to an important role in damage recognition as well as downstream repair and recombination pathways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Thus, p53 response to lesions in DNA caused by normal metabolic processes and DNA damaging agents may be 2-fold: first, to transactive downstream genes that enable cell cycle arrest or apoptosis and, secondly, to recognize and bind these lesions to signal repair pathways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	29	The importance of p53 DNA binding (both sequence dependent for transactivation and sequence independent for lesion recognition) suggests that this activity is tightly regulated by a number of factors to ensure proper p53 function at the correct times during the cell cycle.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	30	 p53 DNA binding activity is affected by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation and sumolation (reviewed in 20).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Binding by the monoclonal antibody, pAB421 (21,22), as well as interaction with single strand DNA (23) activates sequence-specific DNA binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The identification of several cellular and viral proteins that associate with p53 suggests that protein to protein interactions play an important role in the regulation of its DNA binding activity.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This is further supported by the demonstration that Ref-1 is a potent activator of p53 DNA binding activity (24).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	34	 (25) have shown that the high mobility group (HMG) protein HMG-1 stimulates sequence-specific p53 DNA binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	35	The HMG proteins are among the largest group of non-histone chromatin proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	36	 HMG proteins can be classified into three groups: the HMG-1/2, HMG I(Y) and HMG-14/17 families (reviewed in 26).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The exact cellular functions of these proteins are not fully understood.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	38	 They are architectural elements that bind unusual structures in DNA and have low sequence specificity.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The HMG-1/2 family is the most abundant of this group of proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	40	 They interact with DNA through two conserved DNA binding domains known as the HMG boxes (27,28) and preferentially bind DNA structures that contain sharp angles such as cruciforms, four-way junctions (29) as well as cisplatin-DNA adducts (30,31).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The HMG I(Y) proteins contain A-T hook domains that serve as DNA binding motifs and can recognize four-way junctions (32).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Both groups of proteins can induce bends in linear DNA templates as well as introduce supercoils in topologically constrained molecules (33).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	43	 There is growing evidence that these proteins may represent a new class of chaperone factors that can facilitate the interactions of other proteins with their respective target sequence.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For example, HMG-1 induces a structural change in the target sequence of the progesterone receptor, thus facilitating protein binding (34).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Additionally, HMG I(Y) has been shown to regulate long range enhancer-dependent transcription by altering DNA topology (35).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Finally, as mentioned above, HMG-1 can enhance sequence-specific binding of p53 (25).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Thus, this group of proteins seems to enable the  loading  of other proteins on their target sequences.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The ability of the HMG group proteins to recognize unusual DNA structures and their influence on various protein to DNA interactions, as well as the fact that HMG-1 stimulates the sequence-specific binding of p53, makes them good candidates for factors that might affect the lesion binding properties of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, it was critical to ask whether any of these HMG proteins influences p53 recognition of DNA damage.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In this study, the effects of two HMG group proteins, HMG-1 and HMG I(Y), on p53 binding to DNA lesions were examined.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Two different substrates, one containing three 3-cytosine bulges and the other resembling Holliday junctions, were used to monitor the effect of these HMG proteins on p53 DNA binding activity by gel retardation assays.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	52	Lesions such as mismatches and extra base bulges are recognized by the Escherichia coli mismatch repair protein, MutS, and its eukaryotic counterparts (MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6) (36 and references therein).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	53	 p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 share a number of common features.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Both can recognize extra base bulges and Holliday junctions in vitro (16,17,37,38).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Both proteins can inhibit DNA recombination when they encounter DNA lesions both in vivo and in vitro (39,40).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Additionally, these proteins play an important role in genome maintenance by interacting with other repair and replication factors.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The relevance of p53 lesion recognition events within the cell was demonstrated by comparing the effect of the HMG proteins on the DNA binding activity of hMSH2 to hMSH6.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Our results indicate that HMG I(Y) can effectively compete with p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 for Holliday junction binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, HMG I(Y) had no effect on p53 binding to 3-cytosine bulges while dissociating hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with the same substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	60	 On the other hand, it was found that hMSH2 to hMSH6 had a stimulatory effect on p53 binding to both Holliday junctions and 3-cytosine bulges.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, p53 lesion binding activity can be modulated in different ways negative regulation is seen with HMG I(Y) and positive with hMSH2 to hMSH6.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Free probe was detected in reactions containing both proteins, indicating that the loss of hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes is due to dissociation by p53 and not lack of substrate DNA.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The p53/DNA complexes in the absence and presence of increasing amounts of hMSH2 to hMSH6 were quantified and the results revealed a 4 to 5-fold increase in p53 binding to the Holliday junction probe when hMSH2 to hMSH6 was added (Fig.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Similar to the Holliday junction substrate, there was an increase in the p53/DNA complexes with the addition of hMSH2 to hMSH6, with a concomitant decrease in the hMSH2 to hMSH6/DNA complexes.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, in contrast to HMG I(Y), p53 binding activity on both Holliday junctions and 3-cytosine bulges is enhanced by hMSH2 to hMSH6.

0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	212	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Lesion binding by p53 represents an important biological feature of this protein and, to date, p53 has been shown to bind a range of damage intermediates including 3-cytosine bulges and Holliday junctions as well as single and double strand breaks.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The role of damage recognition in downstream pathways is not clear.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	214	 One possibility is the activation of p53 sequence-specific binding to enable transactivation of various gene products that play a key role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Additionally, p53 interactions might facilitate direct recruitment of repair and recombination proteins for resolution of these lesions.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Finally, binding to damage sites may ensure that p53 is in close proximity to protein kinases that can activate p53 by phosphorylating specific serine residues.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Recent studies have argued against allosteric regulation of p53 sequence-specific binding in vivo (49); thus, damage binding may play a more important role in recruitment of repair factors or in events leading to post-translational modifications of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	218	The multiple roles of p53 in DNA recognition and binding necessitate tight regulation of this protein by a host of factors to ensure proper interactions at various recognition sites.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	219	 In this study, the effect of three different proteins on p53 binding to Holliday junctions and extra base bulges was examined.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Two members of the HMG group of proteins, HMG-1 and HMG I(Y), and the mismatch repair protein, hMSH2 to hMSH6, were tested.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The binding properties of p53 to these substrates are modulated in different ways by these proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We found that HMG-1 had no effect on p53 binding to either substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	223	 On the other hand, HMG I(Y) reduced p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 binding to Holliday junction templates.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Interestingly, HMG I(Y) also dissociated hMSH2 to hMSH6 from 3-cytosine bulges but did not affect p53 binding to the same template.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Finally, hMSH2 to hMSH6 enhanced p53 complex formation with both templates.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	226	The dissociation of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from Holliday junction structures by HMG I(Y) may be a result of alteration of DNA conformation.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Holliday junctions can adopt two different conformations the stacked X structure and the square open form.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In the presence of divalent cations, the four-way junctions adopt the stacked X conformation with 60 degrees  and 120 degrees  angles between the arms, whereas in the absence of divalent cations the junctions are in the square open form with 90 degrees  angles between the arms.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	229	 HMG I(Y) has been shown to preferentially bind the open form of the four-way junction and maintain the junctions in this configuration (50).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Previous studies from our laboratory have suggested that p53 may prefer to bind the DNA in the stacked X conformation as opposed to the open form (16).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This was determined by electron microscopy where a large percent of the protein bound Holliday junctions adopted a conformation resembling the stacked X structure.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	232	 HMG I(Y) binding could be causing a conformation change in the Holliday junction making it an unfavorable substrate for p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Our studies also show that HMG I(Y) can dissociate p53/Holliday junction complexes that have been pre-formed.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	234	 It is possible that p53 actively associates and dissociates from the junction crossover and, when dissociated, HMG I(Y) could rapidly bind the junction, altering its conformation, thus preventing p53 re-association.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	235	 On the other hand, the dissociation of both p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes from Holliday junctions may be due to a direct influence of HMG I(Y) on both proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	236	HMG-1 has been shown to interact with p53 using far western assays by Jayaraman et al.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, we were unable to detect similar interactions between p53 and HMG I(Y) using the same assay (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Additionally, immunoprecipitation assays using purified proteins did not reveal any direct interactions between p53 and HMG I(Y) even in the presence of DNA substrates (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Thus, the dissociation of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from Holliday junction templates by HMG I(Y) appears to be a result of the differing binding affinities of these proteins.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	240	The ability of HMG I(Y) to displace proteins from four-way junction substrates has been demonstrated previously.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Four-way junction substrates were used to mimic linker DNA near the entrance and exit points of nucleosomes and histone H1 was shown to bind with high affinity to these structures.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	242	 However, when HMG I(Y) was added there was an active dissociation of H1 from these templates (47).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	243	 It was suggested that since HMG I(Y) plays an important role in genetic recombination and retroviral integration, it dissociates H1 from these structures to allow recombination events to proceed.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This may occur by direct recruitment of proteins for junction resolution or HMG I(Y) may act as a marker to signify the location of the four-way junction.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Displacement of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from Holliday junctions by HMG I(Y) may occur for similar reasons.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	246	 In the event of DNA damage by environmental factors there is an increase in the formation of four-way junctions due to illegitimate sister chromatid exchange.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In the cell, p53, hMSH2 to hMSH6 and HMG I(Y) can bind to these four-way structures.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	248	 We recognize that initial recognition of lesions would primarily be carried out by hMSH2 to hMSH6 and p53 interactions with such sites of damage may provide a backup mechanism for signaling repair.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The HMG proteins are more abundant in cells, hence, HMG I(Y) dissociation of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 from certain lesions or structures would be expected to dominate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, following DNA damaging events the levels and stability of p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 may alter, causing changes in the HMG I(Y) effect.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Genetic studies altering HMG protein levels may be complicated to interpret with regard to, for example, p53-mediated genomic stability or hMSH2 to hMSH6 catalyzed repair, due to the multiple pathways that are involved.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These considerations underscore the need for further studies involving multiple proteins as an approach to learn how lesions are signaled in the cell.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	253	While p53/DNA lesion complexes form with high affinity it is possible that the protein is quite labile on the DNA, thus HMG I(Y) is readily able to dissociate these interactions.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The ability of p53 to form more stable complexes with DNA may require the protein to be post-translationally modified.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Several studies have shown that p53 binding properties are modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Purified p53 used in these studies was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells and was determined to be phosphorylated on at least one site.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Further phosphorylation and/or acetylation may result in conformation changes in p53 that will enable more stable binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Indeed, as mentioned above, p53 binding to lesions may function to bring the protein in close proximity to various kinases.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Studies are currently underway in our laboratory to test the effect of phosphorylating various serine residues with specific kinases on the lesion binding properties of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It should be noted that in the presence of hMSH2 to hMSH6, p53 complexes with lesions is enhanced, suggesting that protein interactions in the vicinity of the lesion dictate DNA binding rather than the lability of p53.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	261	The effect of hMSH2 to hMSH6 on p53/Holliday junction complexes we observed here was in direct contrast to that of HMG I(Y), where the repair protein had a stimulatory effect on p53 binding.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The increase in p53 complexes also results in a concomitant decrease of the hMSH2 to hMSH6 complexes with the same substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This reduction was seen even when molar excesses of hMSH2 to hMSH6 were added to the reactions (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Additionally, when hMSH2 to hMSH6 was pre-incubated with the substrates followed by the addition of p53, enhancement of the p53/DNA complexes was observed (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Similar effects were seen with the 3-cytosine bulge template that is a preferred substrate for hMSH2 to hMSH6.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Hence it appears that hMSH2 to hMSH6 is also able to load p53 on the 3-cytosine bulge substrate.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	267	 It is possible that p53 and hMSH2 to hMSH6 interact with each other at the lesion sites.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, if this were the case, we would expect a novel band containing a ternary complex with both proteins to appear on the gel retardation assays.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	269	 No such complexes were detected in the presence of both proteins with either probe used.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal any interaction between the two proteins in solution (data not shown).
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Thus, hMSH2 to hMSH6 appears to be either recruiting p53 to lesion sites or stabilizing p53/DNA interactions in some manner.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This may occur to ensure that the lesion is signaled to the necessary downstream proteins and cell cycle arrest or apoptosis pathways are executed.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	273	In the nucleus, DNA exists in several different configurations and a range of proteins can bind these various forms.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In this paper, we examined the dynamics between three proteins that bind Holliday junctions and have shown that they interact with each other in different ways.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	275	 p53 binding to these recombination intermediates is affected in opposite ways by HMG I(Y) and hMSH2 to hMSH6 HMG I(Y) dissociates while hMSH2 to hMSH6 promotes binding to Holliday junctions and 3-cytosine bulges.
0.50268346.12034830.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Presumably, in the cellular environment, other proteins will further contribute and dictate specific interactions of these proteins on the DNA.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   S100 calcium-binding proteins such as S100B are elevated in primary malignant melanoma and are used as markers for this and numerous other cancers.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Wild-type p53 protein levels are relatively low in these cancer cells (i.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	6	 when compared with cells without S100B) but are elevated when RNA antisense to S100B is introduced.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This result implicates S100B in the down-regulation of p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (Lin, J.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Down-regulation of p53 in primary malignant melanoma cells is likely the result of a direct interaction with S100B, which was observed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, p53 binds regions of the S100B promoter, one of which matches the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus DNA sequence perfectly.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Therefore, when p53 levels increase, it contributes to its own demise by up-regulating the transcription of S100B as part of a negative feedback loop.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This is analogous to what is found for another protein that down-regulates p53, namely hdm2 (human double mutant 2).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription activator that signals for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and plays a pivotal role in the maintenance and regulation of normal cellular functions (1, 2).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Its inactivation affects cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, gene amplification, centrosome duplication, and ploidy (2 to 9).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	14	 If p53 is inactivated by mutation, as is found in  > 50% of human cancers, the cell cycle proceeds unregulated, and cell growth proliferates.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Likewise, apoptosis pathways are not induced, and proliferating cells transform into cancerous ones (3, 10).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	16	 On the other hand, if p53 levels are too high, then phenotypes associated with aging, particularly those associated with problems in skin and bone, are observed (11).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For these reasons, it is important that p53 protein levels are highly regulated, which is achieved by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins inside the cell (5, 12 to 15).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The interactions of p53 with members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (i.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	19	 S100B) are particularly intriguing because they link p53 biology to calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	20	There are now  > 20 members of the S100 family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, and they are widely distributed in human tissue (16 to 18).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	21	 S100 proteins were given this name because they are soluble in 100% saturated ammonium sulfate (19).

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In a manner similar to that of calmodulin, a Ca2+-dependent conformational change is required for S100B to bind target proteins such as p53 (20, 21).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although it is not completely clear how S100 proteins affect cell growth, S100B and several other S100 proteins (i.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	25	 S100A1, mts1) interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, resulting in significantly reduced p53 levels, and p53-dependent transcription activation of target genes is inhibited (22 to 24).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In primary malignant melanoma cancer cells, we report here that S100B interacts directly with p53 and that inhibiting S100B with siRNA restores the functional p53 protein.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These data support the notion that higher than normal levels of S100B, as found in malignant melanoma, are likely contributing to tumor progression by excessive down-regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	189	  For S100B, the affinity of p53 for its promoter regions are relatively low (Figs.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	190	 4, 5, 6), which suggests that regulation of S100B by p53 would occur only after higher affinity promoter sites are occupied (i.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Specifically, at the levels of the p53 protein necessary to activate the transcription of S100B, numerous other genes (i.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	194	) will have already been transcribed.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	195	 This, of course, is a scenario that one might expect for the regulation of a gene such as S100B, which is involved in a feedback loop that ultimately leads to lowering the levels of functional p53.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	196	Interestingly, p53 is also known to up-regulate the transcription of another S100 protein, S100A2 (36) by binding the p53-binding consensus sequences found in its promoter.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	201	 2) and previously (23) is most likely related to the ability of S100B to bind directly to p53 (Fig.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	202	 3), dissociate the p53 tetramer (29), and/or cause conformational changes in the extreme C terminus and tetramerization domains of the tumor suppressor (30).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Such effects by S100B may work synergistically with the hdm2 protein/pathways, which are involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 (37), although this concept needs to be rigorously established.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Nonetheless, an important distinction between these two negative regulatory proteins (hdm2 versus S100B) is that the S100B interaction with the C terminus of p53 is Ca2+-dependent (21) and links p53 biology to calcium-mediated signaling pathways and extracellular growth responses, whereas, hdm2 binds the N terminus of p53 in a calcium-independent manner and is regulated by other proteins (i.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	207	 One possible explanation for this paradigm is that elevated levels of the proteins that negatively regulate p53, such as S100B, may be a culprit.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Specifically, the overall effect of elevated S100B levels on wild-type p53 could mimic cellular aberrations such as gene amplification and mutations that are encountered with non-functional mutants of p53.
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Specifically, several melanomas have wild-type p53 and higher than normal levels of S100B, and the prognosis for patients such as these is generally poorer than for those with lower S100B levels (39 to 41).
0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	210	 For primary skin cancer cells, we show that there is a direct interaction between p53 and S100B and that functional wild-type p53 levels can be restored when S100B levels are lowered by siRNA (Fig.

0.5670807.15178678.html.plaintext.txt	212	 With these results in mind, perhaps a small molecule inhibitor that binds S100B, blocks the S100B-p53 interaction, and restores wild-type p53 levels (i.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Both the Y-shaped DNA and the DNA bubbles are recognized and incised by the UV light response-induced DNA repair protein UvrBC in the absence of UvrA (77).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Analysis of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) by electron crystallography suggests that DNA-PK binds to sds-DNA with separate binding sites, one for dsDNA and one for ssDNA (78).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Binding to sds-DNA activates its kinase activities.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	195	 There is evidence supporting the concept that sds-DNA is the signal to activate p53 protein.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Induction of p53 has been found to be dependent upon the presence of unwound DNA intermediates from NER (79).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Microinjection of dsDNA with 4 nt 5' overhangs but not of DNA duplexes with blunt ends induces p53-dependent growth arrest in fibroblasts (80).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	198	 While it is clear that p53 activation by sds-DNA is mediated by checkpoint proteins with phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase activity like ATM, ATR and DNA-PK, the biological relevance of p53 binding to sds-DNA is still a matter of speculation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	199	 have recently reviewed activation status of p53 protein with particular attention to the role of p53 protein in DNA repair (81).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The following sections will discuss possible biological functions of p53 protein non-sequence-specific binding to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	201	Is p53 a damage sensor? A prevalent hypothesis about the biological relevance of p53 binding to altered DNA structures is that p53 is a damage sensor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Accordingly, p53 recognizes damaged DNA and recruits DNA repair machinery to the damaged site.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The identification of DNA repair proteins XPB and XPD as p53-associated factors as well as the phosphorylation of p53 protein by CAK (which in addition can activate p53 sequence-specific binding) strongly favor this idea.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Although p53 binding to damaged and mismatched DNA resembles mismatch repair sensor MSH2, there is no evidence to show that p53 protein participates in mismatch repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Each DNA repair machinery complex has its own factor to sense damaged DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The binding to damaged DNA by the sensor is avid and highly specific so as to target the appropriate DNA repair machinery to the particular type of DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	207	 For example, XPC to hHR23B is a damage sensor for NER that binds specifically to pyrimidine dimers (with a Kd value of 5x10 to 9) and specifically recruits XPA and TFIIH to the damage site (82).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	208	 p53 protein offers no obvious specificity to a particular repair machinery as it binds to different types of DNA structures and to proteins involved in different types of repair, like XPB and XPD for NER, and Rad51 for DNA recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Since DNA repair proteins already have components to sense DNA damage, the cell does not require p53 protein strictly as a damage sensor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	210	Is p53 a DNA repair effector? If p53 protein is not primarily a damage sensor, is it directly involved in repair? Several biochemical properties associated with p53 non-sequence-specific binding to DNA have suggested a direct involvement in DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	211	 p53 protein is able to mediate ssDNA reannealing and DNA strand transfer (66,71,83).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	212	 These activities resemble DNA strand invasion and single-strand annealing in homologous recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Homologous recombination is a well conserved cellular mechanism to repair damaged DNA and to mediate chromatin exchange in crossover during normal cellular processes like antibody generation and meiosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Recombination is also a common cause of chromosomal abnormality in cancer development.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Results from in vivo studies show that both inter- and intra-chromosomal recombination are significantly inhibited by wild-type p53 (84,85).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This indicates that p53 may function as a regulator of DNA recombination by recognizing DNA ends and reannealing ssDNA to block abnormal recombination.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, it is possible that DNA recombination can be enhanced by high levels of p53 protein through binding at the C-terminus.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This domain of mutant p53 remains intact in most cases, and stabilization of the mutant makes it highly available for this genetically destabilizing activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We have suggested that increased non-homologous recombination may contribute to the `gain of function' phenotype associated with p53 mutants as implicated by p53 C-terminal activation of topoisomerase I catalytic activity (86).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that p53 protein is capable of rejoining DNA with double strand breaks, indicating its role in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (80,87,88).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Although NHEJ is required in preventing chromosomal translocation (89,90), the lack of specificity of DNA end rejoining by p53 protein may contribute to its `gain of function' phenotype, as mutant p53 is equally active in rejoining DNA ends (87,88).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	222	Although p53 binds to ssDNA and mismatched DNA, there is no direct evidence to support the involvement of p53 in either NER or mismatch repair in cell free systems, and there are no obvious DNA repair defects in p53 knock out mice.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These observations suggest that p53 as guardian of the genome is not primarily involved in DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	224	 recently provided evidence that p53 participates in BER (91).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Incorporation of radiolabeled dNTP into depurinated plasmids in nuclear extracts (indicative of BER activity) was enhanced in cells expressing wild-type p53 and reduced in cells expressing mutant p53 proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	226	 While there is no experimental evidence to show how p53 participates in BER, Mummenbrauer et al.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	227	 have found that wild-type p53 protein possesses intrinsic 3' to 5' exonuclease activity in the presence of magnesium ions (92).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This activity is localized to the central domain of p53 protein based on deletion analysis and structural similarity to the catalytic domain of exonuclease III in Escherichia coli.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is a common mechanism to ensure sequence fidelity during DNA replication and DNA repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This activity provides a molecular basis for p53 involvement not only in BER but also in other DNA repair machinery complexes where proofreading is necessary.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The exonuclease activity of p53 seems to be mutually exclusive to its specific DNA binding activity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	232	 While the C-terminal domain negatively controls both specific DNA binding and exonuclease activity of p53, the exonuclease activity of p53 is inhibited by the activation events for specific DNA binding, such as phosphorylation or PAb421 association.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Inhibition of 3' to 5' exonuclease activity by PAb421 and phosphorylation events that activate p53 suggest its association with latent p53 proteins (81).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	234	 However, binding to non-specific DNA is also affected by these activation events.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	235	 As noted above, both latent and activated p53 proteins are capable of such binding, indicating a more general function of p53 proteins binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	236	Does p53 protein mediate an apoptosis checkpoint? If p53-mediated DNA repair is critical for maintaining genomic integrity, p53 and its related DNA repair function should be well conserved from bacteria to humans.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, p53 and newly discovered members of the p53 gene family are present only in multicellular organisms.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	238	 While p73 and p63 family members bind to the p53 consensus (93,94), to date there are no reports of their capacity for non-sequence-specific binding, for example, to mismatched DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The p53 homolog in Drosophila is the most primitive relative of p53 identified so far.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Drosophila p53 mediates DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not growth arrest, suggesting that the primitive function of p53 is to mediate apoptosis in genome maintenance (95 to 97).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Eliminating cells with damaged DNA by apoptosis is vital for multicellular organisms to prevent genetic transformation (98).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is generally accepted that p53-mediated apoptosis and p53-induced cell cycle checkpoints are the two major mechanisms of p53 protein activity as a tumor suppressor.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is activated by checkpoint proteins well conserved in yeast such as ATM, ATR and Chk2.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis is largely unknown, despite the identification of apoptosis-related genes as downstream transcriptional targets of p53.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	245	 So far it is not clear why p53 mediates growth arrest in certain cells but apoptosis in others responding to the same DNA damage, or how a given cell type determines its response to different DNA damaging agents or even to different doses of the same agent.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Clearly, there are certain signals sensed by p53 protein that trigger the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Given the role of p53 as a guardian of the genome, unrepaired DNA should be a legitimate signal for p53 protein to direct the cell towards the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	248	 There is evidence that when DNA damage is not repaired, activation of p53 can lead to apoptosis (90).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Binding to sds-DNA as defined above suggests a biochemical basis whereby p53 protein might monitor an apoptosis checkpoint in response to a variety of types of DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Rather than sensing the damage primarily to recruit repair proteins, p53 protein may sense the equilibrium between the amounts of damaged DNA and available DNA repair proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This equilibrium would be dependent upon p53 protein modification state, the level of p53 protein accumulation, the level of DNA damage and the capacity of the damaged cell to repair.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Since sds-DNA is also targeted by DNA repair proteins like RPA and Rad51, it is tempting to propose that p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins are competing for sds-DNA dynamically, as reflected in the equation: [sds-DNA] + [p53]/[DNA repair proteins] Apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	253	 According to the scheme represented in Figure 2, DNA damage leads to accumulation of activated p53 proteins with increased affinity for DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Distinct p53 modifications may target different genes, such that certain cells with a higher capacity to repair or less capacity for rapid renewal might arrest, repair and survive.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Because the levels of repair proteins generally far exceed those of p53 protein, sites of damaged DNA would be occupied predominantly by DNA repair proteins if the damage is mild.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, even limited levels of p53 protein may bind damaged DNA above the threshold of DNA repair protein availability.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Alternatively, high levels of p53 induced by DNA damage or oncogenic events could compete with DNA repair proteins for a limited amount of DNA lesions, triggering apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	258	 There is abundant evidence that apoptosis is highly correlated with the level of p53 protein and the extent of DNA damage (99).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Furthermore, increased apoptosis has been linked to p53 when DNA repair is inhibited by inactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a ubiquitous DNA binding protein involved in repair and possibly in apoptosis (100).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It is possible to test the proposed apoptotic checkpoint equation by microinjection of fluorescein-labeled sds-DNA into cells.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	261	 have reported that microinjection of a plasmid with a long gap or DNA with a 5' overhang into fibroblasts induced p53-dependent growth arrest (80).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Cells with apoptotic potential could be used to test the hypothesis that sds-DNA dosage and extent of association of p53 and sds-DNA are directly correlated with p53-dependent apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Comparison of fibroblasts refractory to apoptosis with epithelial cells competent for apoptosis might provide clues as to how cell type-specific transcriptional events lead to survival or apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	264	 While the apoptosis checkpoint controlled by p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA is hypothetical, it provides a framework for explaining how p53-mediated apoptosis is dependent upon cell type or extent of DNA damage and why apoptosis is more likely to be induced in cells less robust for DNA repair proteins.

0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Model: p53 protein mediates an apoptosis checkpoint in response to DNA damage.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	267	 p53 protein is activated by DNA damaging stimuli through multiple post-translational modifications.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Cell type and/or DNA damage-specific responses are dependent upon transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects of DNA binding by p53 proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	269	 An apoptosis checkpoint is determined by thresholds of p53 proteins and damaged DNA (sds-DNA) relative to a constant level of ubiquitous DNA repair proteins (see text).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	270	  The transcriptional and non-transcriptional p53-dependent arms of the p53 response to DNA damage could, theoretically, be exercised independently or cooperatively.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Mainly transcriptional events might occur in cases where p53 is induced at very low levels of sds-DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Non-transcriptional events might predominate in severely damaged cells because transcriptional activities of p53 protein are compromised by conformational changes due to oxidative stress (101).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Cell type-specific responses may require a cooperation of events in which accumulation of proteins encoded by p53 downstream target genes tip the balance toward survival (either due to reversible or prolonged cell cycle arrest) or apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	274	 While apoptosis can be regulated at the transcriptional level by p53, p53-dependent apoptosis can be achieved in a transcription-independent manner.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Examples of this are p53-mediated apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of transcription and translation (102,103) and apoptosis mediated by p53 mutants lacking transcriptional activities (104).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Although the N-terminal proline-rich domain and the C-terminus of p53 protein are required for p53-dependent apoptosis (99,105), the central domain must participate in p53-mediated apoptosis, as tumor cells with p53 mutations are resistant to apoptosis in general.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Furthermore, certain p53 mutants (Ala143, His273) with substantial transactivation activities are defective in apoptosis (106,107).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Using a p53 DNA binding assay applicable to cells and tissues, we found that p53 mutant (His273) in human colon carcinoma cell SW480 has lost its ability to bind non-specific DNA while retaining the ability to bind specific DNA (unpublished data).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This associates the defect in p53 binding non-sequence-specifically to DNA with the defect in p53- mediated transcription-independent apoptosis and is worthy of exploration in other p53 mutants.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	280	Due to the lack of sequence-dependence, apoptosis mediated by sds-DNA binding should be through protein to protein interactions instead of transactivation.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Several lines of evidence coming from the laboratory of Harris and others indicate that DNA repair machinery is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	282	 p53-mediated apoptosis is abrogated in cells with either XPB or XPD mutations and can be restored by introduction of wild-type XP genes (108).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Attenuation of p53-mediated apoptosis was also observed in cells with a defect in WNR, a DNA helicase mutated in Werner syndrome (109).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	284	 At first glance, these observations seem contrary to the hypothesis above, since repair defects might be expected to result in a higher frequency of sds-DNA and increased p53 binding and apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, the increased p53 binding to sds-DNA may occur, but apoptosis as its consequence may be blocked by the repair protein defect.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	286	 These repair protein defects may provide clues as to how the signal of p53 binding to sds-DNA is transduced and linked to the apoptosis pathway.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	287	 XPB and XPD mutants are associated with attenuated apoptosis whereas CSB mutants result in enhanced apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	288	 p53 protein has been found to be associated with XPB, XPD and CSB.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Inhibition of the helicase activities of these proteins by association with p53 suggests that enhancement of DNA repair is not the mechanism by which p53 maintains genomic integrity, at least not through the association with these repair proteins.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Since DNA repair is not necessary in cells committed to apoptosis, these associations may be primarily involved in apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The association between p53 and DNA repair proteins suggests transcription-independent apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Another possibility is that p53 binding non-sequence-specifically at sites of DNA damage mediates p53 modifications by the DNA repair machinery.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Such modifications may confer specificity of p53 DNA binding to transactivate pro-apoptotic genes.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from p53 modification by CAK, a component of TFIIH (25,110).
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This would be a transcriptional means to convey the apoptotic signal if p53 protein dissociates from the complex upon modification.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The availability of functionally distinct p53 mutants and model systems such as the simpler organism Drosophila will provide tools to dissect the mechanism of p53-mediated apoptosis.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	297	Clearly, p53 is a multifunctional protein with multiple potential modifications and biochemical properties.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	298	 A major challenge in the field is how to correlate its biochemical properties with its biological behaviors in cells and, more significantly, in vivo.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Remaining questions include: how are the transcriptional and non-transcriptional arms of p53 response to DNA damage coordinated in specific cell types; what is the nature of the interactions between p53 proteins and DNA repair proteins or other constitutive or induced proteins required for p53-dependent apoptosis; how do p53 and other proteins at the postulated apoptosis checkpoint trigger the next steps in the apoptosis cascade.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	300	 To answer these questions, DNA binding studies must be extended from the test tube to the cells, requiring increasing sensitivity.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Molecular profiling of p53 downstream genes by means of DNA chip technology, affinity assays of cellular p53 protein binding to a range of specific and non-specific DNA templates and identification of discrete p53 proteins modified through phosphorylation and acetylation by means of specific antibodies will make a powerful combination for defining the p53 pathway in response to different genotoxic stresses in cells and tissues.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Application of these approaches will permit defining the p53 response to DNA damage through sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific binding to DNA.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It may reveal how p53 selectively turns on the expression of certain sets of genes through sequence-specific DNA binding or, in the face of overwhelming DNA damage, uses a variety of DNA repair machinery components to trigger apoptosis through non-sequence-specific DNA binding.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Finally, these approaches may uncover how specific post-translationally modified p53 proteins integrate the response to different upstream signals.
0.54812837.11375889.html.plaintext.txt	305	 To fully understand how p53 proteins orchestrate the cellular response to DNA damage, it may be essential to view the location and extent of p53 binding to specific DNA and to damaged DNA and the association of p53 protein with other proteins in the chromatin context in cells responding to DNA damage.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here, we show that caspase inhibition affects cell death commitment decisions by modulating the apoptotic functions of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Indeed, in the Bcl-2-sensitive pathway, transactivation-dependent signalling is activated leading to a rapid MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In contrast, in the Bcl-2-insensitive pathway, p53 is stable and this is associated with transrepression-dependent signalling.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A study with microarrays identified these genes regulated by p53 in the absence of active caspases.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	13	 One of the most important links between the proliferation and cell death machineries is the tumour suppressor protein p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This protein promotes cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage or strong oncogenic stimuli for proliferation (1).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	15	 p53 is a phosphoprotein that is pivotal in suppressing cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In about half of the human cancers, p53 is inactivated directly as a result of mutations in the p53 gene.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In many others, it is inactivated indirectly through binding to viral proteins, or as a result of alterations in genes whose products interact with p53 or transmit information to or from p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	18	The amount of p53 in cells is principally determined by the rate at which it is degraded.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The sequence-specific trancriptional induction of the mdm2 gene results in a product, MDM2, which binds to p53 and stimulates the addition of ubiquitin groups to the C-terminus of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The ubiquitinated p53 is detected and degraded by the proteasome (2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In normal cells, p53 gene expression is low.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In stress conditions or following DNA damage, post-translational changes in p53 or MDM2 can disrupt the balance and allow p53 activation.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	23	 p53 can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation or addition of ribose, and these events can regulate p53 function (1).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	24	p53 action is a transcriptional activator role, forming tetramers that bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner by using a highly conserved DNA-binding domain.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The transcriptional targets of p53 include genes implicated in cell cycle regulation, including p21, gadd45 and 14-3-3 (3,4).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	26	 p53 also induces the transcription of proapoptotic genes, such as fas, noxa, killer/dr5 and bax, which leads to caspase activation with the help of death-inducing signalling complex (at the cell membrane level) or the apoptosome (at the mitochondrial level) (5 to 7).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	27	In many models, the transactivation function is not essential for p53-dependent apoptosis (8 to 10) but the transrepression function may be important (11,12).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Indeed, p53 represses the transcription of a number of genes, including those involved in regulatory cascades mediating cell proliferation (cyclin B and RNA polymerase I) and apoptosis (bcl-2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, p53-mediated repression of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization (stathmin and map4), leading to a decrease in microtubule polymerization, participates in both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (13).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In contrast to the information available concerning p53 as an activator, the mechanism by which repression occurs is less well documented (14,15).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This is due in a large part to there being no identified consensus p53-binding site within repressed promoters (16,17).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The genes up- and down-regulated by p53 are not the same; induced genes being principally pro-apoptotic and repressed genes being anti-apoptotic or important for cell survival.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	33	 It has been shown that p53 can lead to transcription-independent caspase activation (18), probably through a direct effect on the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria (19).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, the physiological relevance of this apparently redundant pro-apoptotic property and the determinism of choice between them are unknown.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	35	We have previously shown that large tumour (LT) inactivation leads to p53-mediated apoptosis in rat embryo fibroblasts (e.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	36	 the REtsAF cell line) expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant (tsA58) of the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) LT antigen (20,21).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Moreover, whereas bcl-2 overexpression inhibits apoptosis, caspase inhibition surprisingly both accelerates apoptosis and abolishes the protective effect of Bcl-2 (22).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-Fluromethylketone (ZVAD)-mediated caspase inhibition changed the outcome of p53 activation from Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis to mitochondria- and caspase-independent cell death, a phenomenon that had not been described previously (23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	39	Indeed, even though it is clear today that physiological cell death can occur in the complete absence of caspases, only a few cases of apoptotic death without caspase activation have been reported, most often caspase-independent cell death is related to paraptosis, autophagy or non-lysosomal cell death (24,25).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Moreover, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins resides at the heart of several alternative death pathways whatever be their apoptotic or necrotic feature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Therefore, the p53-induced cell death program in the presence of ZVAD appears to differ from most caspase-independent alternative pathways: on the one hand by its apoptosis-like nature and on the other hand by being MOMP-independent and insensitive to Bcl-2 protection.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	42	Here, we show that ZVAD treatment affects the cell death commitment decision by modulating the apoptotic functions of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Indeed, in the absence of a caspase inhibitor, p53 activation promotes Bcl-2-sensitive apoptosis through transactivation-dependent signalling that is associated with a rapid MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In contrast, caspase inhibition triggers a Bcl-2-insensitive pathway involving the stabilization of p53 and transrepression-dependent signalling.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	45	 A global study of the transcriptome led to the identification of genes differentially regulated by p53 according to these two signalling pathways.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	46	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Cell lines, cell culture and drugs A rat embryo (RE cells) fibroblast culture was infected with a variant of the SV40, which expresses a temperature-sensitive mutant of the LT antigen, tsA58 (26), and the temperature-sensitive REtsAF cell line was selected and isolated at 33 degrees C.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The wild-type LT immortalizes these cells via the inhibitory binding of the p53 tumour suppressor.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	48	 However, the tsA58 mutant of LT cannot interact with p53 at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, the cells are immortalized at permissive temperature (33 degrees C), whereas at restrictive temperature (39.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We first assayed p53 by western blotting at permissive temperature (33 degrees C) and at various time periods after a temperature shift to 39.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The p53 detected at permissive temperature was in the inactive state, bound to SV40 LT antigen.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	139	 After the temperature shift in the absence of ZVAD, there was a rapid, time-dependent decrease in p53 levels.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This is consistent with reports that p53 induces expression of the mdm2 gene, the product of which induces degradation of p53 by the proteasome.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Conversely, no decrease in p53 abundance was observed in the presence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	142	 RT to PCR analysis showed that ZVAD treatment did not affect the amount of p53 transcript (data not shown), so the regulation of the p53 abundance by ZVAD seems to result from a post-transcriptional mechanism.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	143	 We then examined the effect of ZVAD on the LT antigen (Figure 1): LT gave several bands in western blots due to the diverse modifications of the LT gene following its introduction into mouse or rat cell lines (35).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	144	 We found that ZVAD did not significantly influence the amount of LT (Figure 1), indicating that p53 stabilization was not due to changes in LT levels.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	151	  These results suggest that ZVAD inhibits the degradation of p53 by the proteasome, resulting in a higher concentration of p53 as early as after 8 h at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This coincides with the increased rate of apoptosis reported previously (22).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	153	p53 can induce transcriptional activation-dependent or -independent apoptotic processes The stabilization of p53 by ZVAD may lead to increased p53 transactivation activity of p53 and thereby explain the accelerated death process observed in this condition.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	154	 To test this hypothesis, mRNAs of three p53 target genes (p21, bax and mdm2) were assayed by RT to PCR.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Surprisingly, in the presence of ZVAD and thus more p53, there was less accumulation of these messengers (Figure 2A).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	158	 To confirm that this effect was not a result of ZVAD directly, and independent of p53, we compared mRNA levels at permissive temperature in the presence and absence of ZVAD 24 h after addition (Figure 2A, in frame).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The intensity of the p21, bax and mdm2 mRNAs was very weak consistent with these genes being poorly expressed in the absence of active p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Furthermore, there was no difference according to the presence or absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	161	 ZVAD thus has no effect when p53 is inactive.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	172	 MDM2 and p21 proteins are too weak in the absence of active p53 (33 degrees C) to be detectable.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Tubulin was used as a loading control.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	175	  We tested whether the amount of protein corresponds to the amount of messenger by western blotting (Figure 2B).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	176	 p21 and Bax proteins followed the abundance of their messengers: the proteins accumulated at restrictive temperature, both in the absence and presence of ZVAD, even though the increases observed in the presence of ZVAD were lower than those detected in the absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Conversely, after an initial increase in both protein and messenger levels (until 12 h at 39.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	178	5 degrees C), changes in the MDM2 protein level differed from those in the amount of messenger: in the absence of ZVAD, the amount of MDM2 gradually declined whereas messenger levels were maintained; in the presence of ZVAD, MDM2 levels were stable whereas the messenger decreased (cf.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This discrepancy between protein and messenger changes suggests post-transcriptional regulation of MDM2.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	180	 We confirmed that, like for mRNA levels, ZVAD had no effect on Bax proteins in the absence of active p53 (Figure 2B, in frame).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In this condition MDM2 and p21 proteins are to weak to be detectable.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	182	Thus p53 activation at restrictive temperature induces the transactivation of target genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This transactivation is attenuated in the presence of ZVAD despite a greater abundance of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	184	 MDM2 and p53 proteins present similar fates: the lower protein concentrations in the absence of ZVAD may be due to the ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2 for itself and p53 promoting proteasomal degradation; the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2, in the presence of ZVAD, might be a consequence of less efficient entry into the proteasome when caspases are inhibited.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	185	p53-mediated transcriptional repression is involved in the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway Surprisingly, p53 accumulation in the presence of ZVAD is associated with a reduced transactivation of its target genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Therefore, we investigated whether the accelerated apoptosis induced by ZVAD involves the transcriptional repression activity of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	187	 We tested the transcription of the map4 and stathmin genes in REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells by northern blotting.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The products of these genes regulate microtubule polymerization, and their transcription is negatively regulated by p53 (13,36).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The map4 mRNA is subject to alternative splicing but the messenger studied was the full-length form (6.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We found that p53 activation at 39.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	191	5 degrees C correlated with a transient decrease in both map4 and stathmin mRNA levels and that the decrease was greater in the presence of ZVAD (Figure 3).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	192	 This suggests that ZVAD-induced apoptosis results from an increased transrepression activity of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Also, regulation of the amount of p53, involving one or more caspase(s), may affect which p53 functions are involved: increased amounts of p53 are associated with greater transrepression versus transactivation activity.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	212	 They included many known p53-responsive genes (p21, GADD45 and IGFBP).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Other p53-responsive genes were absent either because they did not pass the filters (e.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, similar microarray studies have shown previously that the pattern of expression of p53-target genes is dependent on p53 activation status; not all known p53 targets are simultaneously activated in any given condition (37 to 39).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Many genes not previously identified as p53-direct-targets were also regulated by p53 induction.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Some of them have been described in other similar studies, as ATPase, H + transporting and hsp70 genes were repressed, and amyloid protein precursor and annexin genes were activated (37 to 39).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Our data did not indicate whether these genes are primary or secondary transcriptional targets of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	219	In the presence of ZVAD (hybridization 39.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Some of these genes have not been identified because not all the probes have been sequenced.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Interestingly, the few genes which were represented by more than one spot on the chip gave reproducible results.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	247	In conclusion, transcriptosome analysis indicates that the ZVAD-mediated commitment to an alternative Bcl-2-insensitive programme was associated with a shift from a transactivation function towards a transrepression activity of p53.

0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In the absence of caspase activity, p53 can induce a Bcl-2-insensitive cell death program (22,23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Here, we report that, in this Bcl-2-insensitive pathway unmasked by ZVAD, one or more ZVAD-sensitive caspases regulate p53 apoptotic functions by modulating activated biochemical properties of the protein.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	256	Caspase inhibition modulates biochemical properties The activation of the alternative pathway is associated with an increased stability, and accumulation, of p53 protein at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This was expected to result in stronger induction of the p53-target genes, explaining the accelerating effect of ZVAD on p53-induced apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Surprisingly, we found that ZVAD-induced p53 accumulation is accompanied by a reduced transcriptional activation of its effectors.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This discrepancy indicates both that the caspase inhibitor modulates p53 properties and that a transactivation-independent apoptotic function of p53 is required to trigger the alternative pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	260	Several studies are consistent with p53 promoting apoptosis through its transcriptional repression activity (12,15,36,41 to 43): certain mutants or deleted forms of p53 that are unable to induce apoptosis have been found to be deficient in transrepression but not in transactivation (44,45); also, a positive association between p53-dependent repression and apoptosis has been demonstrated in some models (15,46).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	261	Therefore, we evaluated the transrepression activity of p53 at restrictive temperature both in the presence and absence of the caspase inhibitor.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We found that genes known to be repressed by p53 (map4 and stathmin) were down-regulated by p53 activation both in the presence and absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, transrepression, which was only transient in the absence of ZVAD, was sustained and stronger in the presence of ZVAD, suggesting that its duration can be determined by the amount of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	264	We then conducted a large-scale study of the transcriptome.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	265	 We showed that caspase inhibition leads to extensive changes in the pattern of regulated genes after p53 activation at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The microarray analysis indicated that 86% (clusters 1 and 2) of the 94 genes modulated by ZVAD were more repressed or less activated in the presence of the drug; in other words, these genes are less expressed when caspases were inactive.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Thus, the inhibition of caspases modifies the contribution of the different transcription activities of p53 to apoptosis the onset of the Bcl-2-insentive process is associated with both a decrease in transactivation and an increase in transrepression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Interestingly, none of the genes activated in the absence of ZVAD became repressed after addition of the drug and none of the repressed genes became activated in the presence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This is consistent with p53-mediated transactivation and transrepression affecting different clusters of genes (as explained in Introduction).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	270	Various different mechanisms have been described to account for p53-mediated repression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Inhibition of the NF-Y transcription factor (47,48) or up-regulation of p21 which leads to hypophosphorylation of Rb and transcriptional repression via E2F1 binding (49), has been implicated.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, there is evidence that p53 can promote sequence-specific repression by binding proteins, like HDAC, that possess deacetylase and chromatin condensation properties.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	273	 According to this model, our data suggest that the composition of transcriptional machinery complexes recruited by p53 on promoters might be modulated by a ZVAD-sensitive protease.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Indeed, p53 can activate transcription through interaction with coactivators, e.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Both of these proteins have histone acetylase (HAT) activity, which is critical for the transactivation function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Conversely, to repress transcription p53 recruits histone deacetylases through a physical association with mSin3a.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The time course of p53 association with mSin3a and p300 might differ according to the presence or absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Interestingly, the C-terminal mSin3a-interaction domain and tetramerization domain of p53 overlap (43).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Therefore, this interaction could contribute to the decrease in p53 transactivation in favour of increased transrepression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	280	 How ZVAD promotes the formation of this complex on promoters of p53-repressed genes remains unclear.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	281	Nevertheless, the fact that a large number of genes are repressed in the presence of ZVAD suggests that these down-regulations may also be involved, at least in part, p53 indirectly controlling either the expression or the activity of other transcription factors.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	282	Function of genes modulated by ZVAD The most striking transcriptional modification associated with the commitment to the alternative apoptotic pathway is increased repression.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We then focused on the function of genes that were down-regulated in the presence of ZVAD in order to elucidate the signalling of this new apoptotic pathway (see Figure 5 and Table 2).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	284	Most of the genes affected were more repressed in the presence of ZVAD, and they included genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix and those of the cytoskeleton (procollagen, myosin and others).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This is consistent with the caspase inhibitor accelerating the commitment to apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Indeed, we observed that morphological changes including the loss of adherence, cell shrinking and cell rounding were more rapid in the presence than in the absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	287	 These events involve major alterations of both the cytoskeleton and the interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	288	Numerous genes were not regulated by p53 in the absence of ZVAD but were repressed by p53 when caspases were inhibited.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These genes are thus specifically implicated in the alternative pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	290	 They include genes encoding regulators of transcription, e.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	291	 the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 and the transcription factor E2a.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Interestingly, high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 1 gene (hmgn1), encodes an activator of transcription which binds to the minor groove of DNA, promoting transcription by inducing a conformational change of the chromatin (50).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The hmg 17 gene, another member of the high-mobility group family, is a known primary target of p53 (51).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Possibly hmgn1 is also a direct target of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	295	 The down-regulation of this type of transcription factor could trigger a process of amplification contributing to the overall transactivation decrease observed in the presence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Indeed, most of the genes identified in our analysis have not been reported to be p53 targets and our approach does not discriminate between genes directly repressed by p53 in a sequence-specific manner and genes repressed indirectly by a cascade of regulations.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Another type of gene identified in our study was regulators of cell cycle (including growth arrest specific 6, polymerase beta and cell division cycle 2 homolog A).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	298	 This is consistent with the established ability of p53 to arrest the cell cycle through transcriptional regulation.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Furthermore, the commitment of REtsAF-Bcl-2 cells to apoptosis is associated with an inability to respond appropriately to p53-induced negative regulators of the cell cycle (52).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	300	Surprisingly, 94 genes regulated by ZVAD included few genes known to be involved in apoptosis.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	301	 There are several possible explanations: (i) many apoptotic genes were not represented on the array used, (ii) the signals given by these genes do not pass the statistical tests, (iii) the apoptotic genes were among the unidentified regulated genes and (iv) the Bcl-2- and caspase-insensitive pathway involves unidentified genes.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	302	p53 protein level determines activated biochemical properties Activation of the alternative pathway was associated with an increased stability of p53 at restrictive temperature.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	303	 There was a parallel accumulation of MDM2, a consequence of a post-transcriptional mechanism.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Presumably, these two proteins do not pass as rapidly to the proteasome as they do at restrictive temperature in the absence of ZVAD.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	305	Control of p53 stability appears to be central in the determination of the p53 apoptotic pathway.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Numerous studies show that the heterogeneous responses of gene transcription to p53 activation by diverse agents could be due to p53 protein levels differing according to the nature of the stress signal (37).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	307	 In our model, target genes can be transactivated by p53 in a transient manner, the transient nature being determined by MDM2-mediated degradation of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In contrast, it could be argued that transcriptional repression is effective only if repression complexes are present on the promoters of repressed genes for prolonged periods (43,53).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	309	 By protecting p53 from degradation, caspase inhibition may therefore enhance the effectiveness of p53 as a transrepressor.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Note that two components of the proteasome were repressed in the presence of ZVAD (cluster 2 of DNA chip analysis), and this may contribute to the decrease in p53 and MDM2 proteasomal degradation in this condition.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	311	However, the effect of caspase inhibition appears to be more puzzling.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Unlike the effect on transrepression, p53 accumulation does not promote greater transactivation efficiency.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	313	 As MDM2 also accumulates in the presence of ZVAD, probably as the result of inhibition of its proteasome-mediated degradation, it is possible that ZVAD blocks the caspase-mediated inactivation of a component which regulates, via MDM2, the stability and the apoptotic function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	314	 (54) report that Rb, MDM2 and p53 can interact in a ternary complex in which Rb regulates the apoptotic function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	315	The modification of the p53 protein itself depends on the types of stress (38): different types of DNA damage activate different protein kinases which phosphorylate different serine or threonine residues on the protein.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	316	 The presence or absence of ZVAD may similarly cause different types of post-transcriptional modification.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Whether these modifications qualitatively influence the outcome of p53 activation remains unclear.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Thus, the overall transcription pattern of a cell might depend on the nature of qualitative and quantitative p53 status.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	319	   CONCLUSIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   We report evidence supporting a new paradigm for the regulation of the apoptotic function of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	320	 We propose a new model in which one or more ZVAD-sensitive caspases determine the outcome of p53 activation by modulating the stability and biochemical properties of p53.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	321	 When caspases are active, p53 activation is followed by a rapid MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 and a transactivation-dependent apoptotic program which engages the mitochondrial pathway (23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	322	 In contrast, in the absence of caspase activity, p53 activation triggers transrepression-dependent signalling for an alternative Bcl-2-insensitive (23) apoptotic program, which is associated with stabilization of p53 protein.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	323	It is important to note that the effect of ZVAD is specific for p53 and not for LT antigen.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Indeed, a dominant-negative form of p53 abolishes the proapoptotic action of ZVAD and ZVAD also potentiates p53-induced apoptosis in rat primary fibroblasts which do not express LT (23).
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This latter observation reinforces the idea that the caspase-dependent control of p53 activity has a physiological relevance.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Nevertheless, this needs to be tested in human cells.
0.5729515.15326223.html.plaintext.txt	327	Further analysis and cataloguing of p53 targets genes regulated in response to various conditions (like ZVAD) may help to connect p53 activation to the apoptotic network.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We show that geldanamycin or radicicol, specific inhibitors of Hsp90, diminish specific wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Consequently, these inhibitors decrease p21 mRNA levels, which lead to a reduction in cellular p21/Waf1 protein, known to induce cell cycle arrest.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In control experiments, we show that neither geldanamycin nor radicicol affect p53 mRNA levels.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A minor decrease in p53 protein level following the treatment of human fibroblasts with the inhibitors suggests the potential involvement of Hsp90 in the stabilization of wild-type p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	9	 To support our in vivo findings, we used a reconstituted system with highly purified recombinant proteins to examine the effects of Hsp90 on wild-type p53 binding to the p21 promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The human recombinant Hsp90 -isoform as well as bovine brain Hsp90 were purified to homogeneity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both of these molecular chaperones displayed ATPase activity and the ability to refold heat-inactivated luciferase in a geldanamycin- and radicicol-sensitive manner, suggesting that post-translational modifications are not involved in the modulation of Hsp90 activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We show that the incubation of recombinant p53 at 37  degrees C decreases the level of its wild-type conformation and strongly inhibits the in vitro binding of p53 to the p21 promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Interestingly, Hsp90 in an ATP-dependent manner can positively modulate p53 DNA binding after incubation at physiological temperature of 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Other recombinant human chaperones from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to efficiently substitute Hsp90 in this reaction.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Consistent with our in vivo results, geldanamycin can suppress Hsp90 ability to regulate in vitro p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In summary, the results presented in this article state that chaperone activity of Hsp90 is important for the transcriptional activity of genotypically wild-type p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	17	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor, which regulates cellular response to stress, abnormal cell proliferation, and DNA damage (1, 2).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	18	 More than 50% of human cancers possess the mutated p53 gene (3), and the inactivation of p53 function leads to cell transformation (4, 5).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Most oncogenic p53 mutations are located in its DNA binding domain, inhibiting ability of this protein to initiate transcription (3).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, p53 may also be rendered inactive by other cellular events, such as the sequestration of wt-p531 in the cytoplasm, because of increased nuclear export (6) or the association of p53 to cytoplasmic proteins (7, 8).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Recently it was shown that p53 is transported in HEK cells to the nucleus along microtubular tracks by cytoplasmic dynein and the Hsp90 molecular chaperone (9), which is similar to the mechanism described for rapid ligand-induced movement of the glucocorticoid receptor to the nucleus (10, 11).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Processes that inhibit p53 nuclear transport and proteolysis also lead to the inactivation of p53 protein (12, 13).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	23	In the response to various stresses, such as ionizing radiation, UV and hypoxia, p53 is activated, stabilized, and imported into the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of several genes whose products induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis (14).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In a non-stress situation, the level of p53 in the cells is mainly regulated at the post-translational level by MDM2 (12, 15 to 17).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	25	Hsp90 is an abundant molecular chaperone important for protecting cells from stress, such as high temperature.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Additionally, Hsp90 regulates many signaling pathways.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Hsp90 is found in a complex with several oncoproteins, including v-Src, c-Erb2, Raf-1, Akt, Bcr-Abl, and tumor suppressor p53 (18 to 22).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) is currently in phase II of clinical trials as a potential anti-tumor drug.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Hsp90 inhibitors usually induce ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (23).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In tumor cells, Hsp90 exists in a functionally distinct conformational form that is much more efficiently recognized by 17-AAG.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This form of Hsp90, which possesses elevated ATPase activity, is found in a multichaperone complex with cochaperones: p23, Hop, and probably others (24).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	32	It has been known for years that genotypically mutant p53 co-immunoprecipitates with members of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 families (19).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Such interactions lead to the formation of a p53 multichaperone complex that is responsible for the stabilization and sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm (25 to 27).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Binding of molecular chaperones to mutant p53 inhibits the ability of MDM2 to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the stabilization of both p53 and MDM2 (28, 29).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It also has been shown that Hsp90 directly associates with the MDM2 protein (30).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Hsp90 inhibitors can partially disrupt these interactions, which results in the degradation of mutant p53 (31, 32).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	37	 With the use of highly purified proteins, we have identified intermediate reactions that lead to the assembly of molecular chaperone complex with p53 protein possessing wild-type or mutant sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The presence of Hsp90 in a complex with wt-p53 inhibits binding of Hsp40 and Hsc70 to p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, the conformational mutant of p53, which possesses low affinity toward Hsp90, can form a stable multichaperone complex in which Hsp90 is bound to mutant p53 indirectly (mut p53-Hsp40-Hsc70-Hop-Hsp90).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Several independent methods, such as surface plasmon resonance, immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and cross-linking were used to demonstrate that Hsp90 directly, in the absence of any other co-chaperones, can associate with genotypically wt-p53 but not with mutant p53 protein (33).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The accompanying article by Muller et al.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Moreover, it has been shown by NMR that Hsp90 associates with a truncated version of wt-p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	43	 It was suggested that the p53 core domain bound to Hsp90 is predominantly unfolded and lacking helical or sheet secondary structure (35).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	44	Wild-type p53 is a structurally unstable protein, which undergoes conformational changes at elevated temperatures (36, 37).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We have proposed that during heat shock, cytoplasmic p53 possessing the wild-type sequence could temporarily adopt a mutant conformation, subsequently initiating the formation of a multichaperone complex that could partially stabilize wt-p53 (19).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Results from a recently published article by Wang and Chen (38) support our hypothesis.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	47	 They found that heat shock inhibited p53 ubiquitination and initiated the accumulation of p53 at the post-translational level.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Two factors influence these events during heat stress: 1) ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 and 2) formation of the chaperone complex with genotypically wt-p53, which adopts a conformation characteristic to that of a mutant protein (38).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The evidence for Hsp90 binding to mutant p53 is conclusive, whereas the exact nature of cellular interactions between Hsp90 and genotypically wt-p53 possessing either wild-type or mutant conformation still remains to be elucidated.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	50	In this study, we demonstrate that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is required for wt-p53-dependent transcriptional activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, inhibit p53 activity as the transcription factor by dissociation of p53 from its target DNA promoter sequence sites.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Results from the reconstituted in vitro system clearly show that Hsp90 positively regulates p53 DNA binding to a specific promoter sequence after incubation at physiological temperature of 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Moreover, this Hsp90 activity is ATP-dependent and inhibited by geldanamycin.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	164	 K15 cells express genotypically wt-p53, which can be immunoprecipitated with wt-p53-specific pAb1620 antibody, but not with the mutant p53-specific pAb240 antibody (data not shown).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This suggests that in K15 cells, p53 exists in a functional, wild-type conformation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The functionality of p53 in the K15 cells was further demonstrated by its ability to induce p21/Waf1 expression and cell cycle arrest upon camptothecin treatment or irradiation (Fig.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	177	 All results are representative of at least three independent experiments.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	178	  Treatment of K15 cells with 2  microM camptothecin (CPT), a drug which induces DNA damage by inhibition of topoisomerase I, results in a p53 up-regulation as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	179	 When the camptothecin treatment was performed in the presence of specific Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol (3  microM), p53 was induced to somewhat lower levels, and the time course of the induction was slower (Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Importantly, the relative amount of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 was not affected by the Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This suggests that Hsp90 might act on p53 directly, rather than through ATR, DNA-PK, or ATM kinases, which are known to phosphorylate p53 at this position (47, 48).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	182	 To exclude the possibility that the lower p53 levels were caused by a decrease of its transcription, we quantified p53 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	183	 1B, treatment of cells with geldanamycin or radicicol did not significantly change the level of p53 transcripts, suggesting that those drugs down-regulate p53 at the protein level.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	184	 By fluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation we showed that geldanamycin or radicicol do not affect the nuclear localization of p53 (results not shown).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	185	 These results indicate that Hsp90 might play a role in the stabilization of the wt-p53 protein.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	186	To test whether Hsp90 indeed can influence the transcriptional activity of p53, we analyzed the binding of p53 to the p21 promoter by ChIP.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	187	 1C, the camptothecin-induced binding of p53 to the p21 promoter was almost completely disrupted by geldanamycin.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The ChIP experiment for p21 promoter was also successfully performed using anti-Hsp90 antibodies, suggesting a functional interaction between wt-p53 and Hsp90.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	189	2 Further, we have shown by real-time RT-PCR that geldanamycin or radicicol strongly inhibit the expression of p21 mRNA following the camptothecin treatment (Fig.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Taken together, described results suggest that while to some extent Hsp90 stabilizes genotypically wt-p53 protein level, a stronger effect is visible on the transcriptional activity of the wt-p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These phenomena evidently depend on ATP, since both drugs effectively compete with ATP for binding to Hsp90.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	220	 (46), long competitor DNA molecules inhibited the entry of p53-DNA complexes into the EMSA gel, which caused a decreased quality and reproducibility of our results.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This problem was solved by the introduction of short, 44-bp competitor DNA fragments to the DNA binding reaction.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	222	It has been previously shown that p53 protein can exist in a constant state of equilibrium between wild-type and mutant conformation (52, 53).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is possible that elevated temperatures could shift this equilibrium toward a mutant conformation, hence the amount of p53 possessing the wild-type conformation should be decreased.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In the mentioned case, the presence of ATP diminishes to a great extent the DnaK-dependent protection of RNA polymerase at elevated temperatures.

0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	304	 It has been demonstrated that mutant p53 associates to and is stabilized by a multichaperone complex (31, 33).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	305	 p53 protein, encoded by the non-mutated gene, has also been found associated to Hsp90 and presumably other chaperones at elevated temperatures, probably due to the conformational transition of p53 from wild-type to a form characteristic to the mutant protein (38).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	306	 However, it was not possible to co-immunoprecipitate wild-type conformation p53 with molecular chaperones from cell lysates (26, 29, 59).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	307	 A recently published study suggests that Hsp90 inhibitors influence the degradation of p53 temperature sensitive mutant at permissive temperatures in which p53 presumably adopts a wild-type conformation (60).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	308	 In contrast, articles by other groups show no significant effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on genotypically wt-p53 level at physiological temperature (26, 38, 59), although these inhibitors may cause conformational change of wt-p53 (30).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	309	In this article we show the effect of geldanamycin and radicicol on the activity of genotypically wt-p53 in human fibroblasts.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Whereas the presence of geldanamycin or radicicol had minor effects on the cellular wt-p53 level and its phosphorylation at Ser-15, these Hsp90 inhibitors dramatically influenced p53 activity as the transcription factor, measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as quantitative analysis of p21 mRNA and protein levels.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The observed effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on the p53 transcriptional activity is not caused by the inhibition of the nuclear transport of p53 (results not shown).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	312	 These in vivo data suggest that Hsp90 may play a role in the regulation of p53-promoted transcription.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	313	 To examine the possible effects of Hsp90 on p53 DNA binding activity, in vitro DNA binding studies were performed with purified human Hsp90 recombinant protein and Hsp90 purified from a bovine brain (a mixture of bovine and Hsp90 isoforms).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Both Hsp90 protein preparations displayed similar ATPase and luciferase refolding activities that were inhibited by geldanamycin.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	315	The gel shift assay was used to monitor in vitro p53 binding to the p21 promoter DNA sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	316	 A wt-p53 conformation, recognized by pAb 1620, is essential for this activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Incubation of the p53 protein encoded by the non-mutated sequence, at 37  degrees C decreases the amount of p53 protein found in an immunocomplex with pAb 1620 as well as the p53 DNA binding.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	318	 In fact, incubation of wt-p53 for 1 h at 37  degrees C completely abolished p53 binding to the p21 promoter-derived sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Interestingly, the presence of increasing amounts of Hsp90 during the incubation of p53 at 37  degrees C can positively regulate p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence, whereas other human recombinant chaperone proteins from Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were not able to substitute for Hsp90 activity.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This activity is ATP-dependent and can be inhibited by geldanamycin.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	321	 These effects correlate with our in vivo results, where geldanamycin inhibited p53 binding to the chromatin as well as transcription from the p21 promoter.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	322	 In order to examine the possibility that transient Hsp90 interactions are required for positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C, we monitored the direct binding of Hsp90 to p53 in the presence or absence of ATP.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Similar to Hsp70-substrate complex formation (61, 62), the presence of ATP shifted the binding/dissociation equilibrium toward dissociation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	324	 These results suggest that the influence of Hsp90 on p53 DNA binding cannot be explained by the passive protection of wt-p53 conformation, caused by static association with Hsp90.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	325	 We showed that the presence of ATP, which induces dissociation of Hsp90 from p53, also promotes the ability of p53 to bind to the DNA promoter sequence at 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	326	The concentrations of geldanamycin and radicicol, which are sufficient to inhibit Hsp90-dependent in vivo transcriptional activity of p53 are lower than the concentration of Hsp90 inhibitors used in our in vitro assays, suggesting that we are only reconstituting the minimum Hsp90 chaperone systems in vitro.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	327	 We are in the process of testing the hypothesis that the presence of Hsp90 co-chaperones could influence the inhibitors' affinity to Hsp90 and Hsp90-dependent p53 binding to the promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	328	 However, our results already indicate that the influence of Hsp90 on wt-p53 activity should be taken into consideration while using Hsp90 inhibitors in the therapeutic treatment of cancer, especially if cancer cells possess wt-p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	329	There are at least two possibilities of explaining the mechanism for Hsp90 positive regulation of p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence at 37  degrees C.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	330	 First, Hsp90 inhibits p53 aggregation or catalyzes the disaggregation of p53 protein at elevated temperatures.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Such a mechanism was previously discovered for chaperones belonging to prokaryotic (57, 58) and eukaryotic (63) Hsp70 families; and now is shown for Hsp90 in presence of p53 by Muller et al.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Second, the Hsp90 association with wt-p53 could induce the partial unfolding of p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Following the dissociation of this Hsp90-p53 complex in the presence of ATP, p53 could spontaneously refold back into a wild-type conformation with a high affinity for the p21 promoter sequence.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	334	 A similar mechanism of molecular chaperone action was proposed in the case of Hsp100 involved in protein folding and proteolysis (64).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The unfoldase activity of Hsp100 molecular chaperone was eventually demonstrated by a subsequent study (65).
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Recent data from the Ted Hupp laboratory (30) suggest that Hsp90 in the presence of MDM2 could indeed partially unfold p53.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	337	 We propose that partial unfolding of p53 could be catalyzed by Hsp90, and the subsequent spontaneous refolding of p53 back into a wild-type-like conformation may prevent p53 aggregation thus increasing p53 DNA binding to the promoter sequence (see Fig.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	338	 More importantly, these chaperone-mediated actions would decrease the probability for the formation of kinetically trapped, mutant-like intermediates and that would allow a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward the active, wt-p53 conformation.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	339	 These events would ultimately promote the p53 transcriptional activity and allow for the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 protein.
0.48231745.15358769.html.plaintext.txt	340	 In addition, the retention of p53 in a wild-type conformation by transient Hsp90 interaction would also inhibit the formation of a multichaperone-p53 complex, which prevents p53 degradation and import to the nucleus (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, July 1, 2005 , and in revised form, August 11, 2005.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apoptotic death of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is a prominent feature of blood vessel remodeling.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the present study, we examined the novel PKC isoform protein kinase C delta (PKC) and its role in vascular SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In A10 SMCs, overexpression of PKC was sufficient to induce apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PKC diminished H2O2-induced apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, evidence is provided that the tumor suppressor p53 is an essential mediator of PKC-induced apoptosis in SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Activation of PKC led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, blocking p53 induction with small interference RNA or targeted gene deletion prevented PKC-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression rescued the ability of PKC to induce apoptosis in p53 null SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We also establish that PKC regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Specifically, the transcriptional regulation required p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for serine 46, did not involve MAPK.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Additionally, PKC, p38 MAPK, and p53 co-associate in cells under conditions favoring apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Together, our data suggest that SMC apoptosis proceeds through a pathway that involves PKC, the intermediary p38 MAPK, and the downstream target tumor suppressor p53.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)3 is a well established component of the remodeling that occurs during normal development of the circulatory system (1, 2) as well as during the course of neointimal formation after intervention for atherosclerosis (3 to 5).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Because increased total cellularity is a prominent feature of an occluding neointima, the balance between proliferation and apoptosis during vessel healing appears central to this pathologic process (6, 7).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that abnormal SMC apoptosis leads to neointimal hyperplasia (8 to 11).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, despite the importance of SMC apoptosis, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of apoptotic pathways in SMCs remains largely undetermined.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	18	Apoptosis is a multistage, genetically controlled process of selective cell deletion.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Protein kinases regulate the early stages of apoptosis by phosphorylating key proteins (12, 13), whereas caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are the main effectors whose activation results in the characteristic morphological changes associated with programmed cell death such as membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation (14, 15).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	20	Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family are activated by diverse stimuli and participate in multiple cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (16).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The novel PKC isoform, protein kinase C delta (PKC), has been shown to be associated with the response to DNA damage and other apoptotic stimuli in specific cell types (17 to 20).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The critical role of PKC in vascular SMC apoptosis and pathogenesis of a neointimal lesion has been recently demonstrated using PKC "knock-out" mice.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The PKC null mice developed exacerbated vein graft intimal lesions that contain fewer apoptotic vascular cells compared with the wild-type mice (21).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Furthermore, aortic SMCs isolated from PKC null mice are resistant to apoptotic stimuli including H2O2.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, the mechanism by which PKC mediates SMC apoptosis remains to be defined.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	26	The tumor suppressor p53 is the master regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In particular, an important role of p53 in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases is suggested by decreased p53 levels in human restenotic (22) and atherosclerotic lesions (23).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The importance of p53 is also confirmed in various animal models.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 to rat carotid arteries inhibited neointimal formation following balloon injury (24), whereas target deletion of p53 led to larger intimal lesions in a mouse vein graft model (25).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	30	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 has been shown to be activated by cellular stress, UV light radiation, growth factor withdrawal, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (26 to 29).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Upon activation, p38 phosphorylates various transcription factors but, of particular note, has been demonstrated to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor p53 (30).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	32	 p38 MAPK is also implicated in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (12, 31) However, its activity is likely cell type-specific, with most studies focusing predominantly on inflammatory cells (32).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	33	In this report we scrutinized the precise molecular mechanism of PKC-induced vascular SMC apoptosis and provide evidence that PKC activation leads to accumulation/modification of p53, which is essential for the induction of apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, the role of p38 as an intermediate in PKC-induced p53 accumulation and apoptosis has also been demonstrated.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In total, these studies provide an explicit link between PKC, p38 activation, and p53 modulation in the process of SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These findings have implications for the development of improved approaches for the prevention and management of restenosis.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A10 SMCs were treated with the apoptotic stimulus H2O2 at a concentration of 200  microM for 6 h in the presence and absence of the PKC-specific inhibitor rottlerin.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Similar to what has been reported previously in mouse vascular SMCs, A10 cells, a rat aortic SMC line, responded to H2O2 with a large increase in DNA fragmentation.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Pre-treatment of A10 cells with rottlerin (1  microM for 1 h) diminished the induction of DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 (Fig.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Alternatively, we inhibited PKC expression by treating cells with an antisense oligonucleotide.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Compared with the control oligo, PKC antisense oligo produced a significant reduction in the level of endogenous PKC (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Taken together, these data confirmed that PKC is a necessary component of the apoptotic pathway in vascular SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	82	Overexpression of PKC Induces Apoptosis and Accumulation of the Tumor Suppressor p53 We next evaluated whether overexpression of PKC would be sufficient to induce vascular SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	83	 To this end, we employed an adenovirus encoding full-length wild-type PKC (AdPKC), which led to a marked increase in cellular levels of PKC (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	86	 At these concentrations, PMA alone did not induce apoptosis as indicated by the lack of fragmented DNA as well as the absence of activated caspase-3.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, the PKC activator PMA, in combination with overexpression of PKC, resulted in an increase in DNA fragmentation by  > 3-fold (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	89	 These data establish that overexpression of PKC is sufficient to induce SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Because p53 has been implicated in SMC apoptosis, we investigated whether the overexpression of PKC and its dramatic increase in SMC apoptosis were associated with an induction of p53.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Next, we tested whether the PKC-induced p53 accumulation leads to enhanced p53-dependent gene transcription by using a luciferase reporter gene containing a p53-specific enhancer element (40, 41).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Co-transfection of a PKC expression vector significantly increased p53 reporter activity.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	95	 More importantly, the addition of the PKC activator PMA facilitated the effect of PKC on the p53 reporter, which is consistent with the ability of PKC to induce p53 expression and SMC apoptosis (Fig.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	204	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   PKC, a member of the novel PKC subfamily, can be pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic depending on cell types and stimuli.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In agreement with a previous report (21), our results support the notion that PKC is proapoptotic in vascular SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Because molecular activation of PKC alone was sufficient to result in caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, we speculate that activation of PKC is an early event leading to the onset of programmed cell death in SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	207	The molecular mechanisms linking PKC to the induction of apoptosis have been explored to some extent in non-smooth muscle cells.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Several studies suggest that the presence of a positive regulatory loop between PKC and caspase-3; however, exactly how PKC might stimulate caspase-3 remains unclear (45, 46).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Another important target of PKC is the mitochondria.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It was demonstrated in HeLa cells (47) and keratinocytes (48) that overexpression and activation of PKC leads to a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, which subsequently leads to activation of caspases and apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Additionally, several nuclear proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (49), p73 (50), and lamin B (51) have been identified as PKC targets/substrates.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Activated PKC associates with and phosphorylates these proteins; such interactions, at least in part, contribute to apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In the current study, we present evidence that the tumor suppressor p53 is a necessary mediator of PKC-induced apoptosis in vascular SMCs.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	214	 We have shown that activation of PKC led to accumulation as well as phosphorylation of p53 in SMCs; this induction correlated with SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Moreover, blocking p53 induction with siRNA prevented apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Finally, targeted gene deletion of p53 prevented PKC-induced apoptosis, whereas restoring p53 expression through adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transfer rescued the ability of PKC to induce apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	217	 To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the direct involvement of p53 in the regulation of SMC apoptosis by PKC.

0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	231	  Experimental evidence is now provided that PKC regulates p53 at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, apparently mediated by separate signaling mechanisms.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Specifically, the transcriptional regulation requires p38 MAPK, whereas the post-translational modification, at least for Ser-46, does not require MAPK.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The importance of post-translational regulation of p53 by PKC is demonstrated by our observation that ectopic expression of p53 alone was insufficient to induce apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Only when co-expressed with PKC was p53 able to restore apoptosis of p53 null cells, presumably through a PKC-dependent phosphorylation.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It was surprising that the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB20358, significantly inhibited PKC-induced accumulation of p53 but did not affect p53 phosphorylation at Ser-46, because direct interaction between p53 and p38 MAPK (52) has been suggested previously.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Indeed, we showed that all three proteins, p53, p38 and PKC, co-associated in the immunoprecipitation complex isolated from SMC lysates.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Our attempts to evaluate other serine residues within the p53 molecule are currently not possible due to a lack of specific phospho-antibodies.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Therefore, it remains to be determined whether PKC and p38 stimulate p53 phosphorylation at additional residues.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	239	 With respect to Ser-46, our data suggest that it is p38-independent.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	240	The potential role of PKC in the regulation of p53 accumulation has been suggested previously.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Using the selective PKC inhibitor rottlerin, Niwa et al.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	242	 (44) demonstrated that the inhibition of PKC decreases H2O2-induced p53 accumulation in bovine endothelial cells.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	243	 (53) observed an increase in the p53 level by overexpressing PKC, whereas Abbas et al.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (54) demonstrated a suppression of p53 basal expression by inhibiting PKC in ML-1 cells (acute myeloid leukemia cells).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	245	 We have now demonstrated that in vascular SMCs the overexpression of PKC increased the accumulation of both the p53 protein and mRNA.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	246	 (55) found that the PKC inhibitor rottlerin increases p53 levels in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells, whereas the PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate attenuates p53 levels in the same cell line.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Therefore, it is likely that PKC, paralleling its dual functions in apoptosis, plays multiple roles in regulating p53 expression, which is dependent upon the cell type and stimuli employed.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	248	Our findings that PMA alone did not induce apoptosis in control or AdNull-infected SMCs is seemingly surprising, because these cells express endogenous PKC, and PMA activates PKC.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The lack of cell death associated with PMA treatment may be related to the effect of PMA on other PKC isotypes.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	250	 We have shown previously that SMCs express at least eight isotypes of PKC, among which six can be activated by PMA (56).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Some of these PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms, such as PKC, are pro-apoptotic, whereas others, such as PKC, have been demonstrated to be anti-apoptotic in non-SMCs (57 to 59).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Our data show that overexpressing PKC shifts the PMA response in favor of apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	253	 However, the outcome of simultaneously activating multiple PKC isotypes, as may occur in control SMCs treated with PMA, appears to result in no net effect on cell death.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	254	The present study highlights another interesting finding that PKC stimulates p53 gene expression through p38 MAPK.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We showed that inhibition of p38 completely eliminated PKC-stimulated accumulation of p53 protein and mRNA.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Moreover, analyses using a p53 promoter reporter demonstrated that PKC up-regulated p53 promoter activity, also in a p38-dependent manner.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Several transcription factors have been identified to bind and regulate the murine p53 promoter, including NFB (60).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	258	 (61) showed in articular chondrocytes that NO-induced activation of p38 up-regulates p53 expression through NFB.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Moreover, the NFB pathway has been shown to be activated by PKC in several cell types (62 to 64).
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Future studies are mandatory to directly test the role of NFBinPKC-induced p38-dependent transcriptional regulation of p53.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	261	In summary, our results demonstrate that PKC plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathway leading to vascular SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The p38-dependent-accumulation and independent-phosphorylation of p53 by PKC contributes, at least in part, to SMC apoptosis.
0.544895.16118209.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Given the critical role of apoptosis in intimal hyperplasia, it is possible that enhancement of PKC activity at different stages after vascular intervention may provide a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of restenosis.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, January 10, 2005.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The extracellular matrix regulates many cellular processes, including survival, and alterations in the matrix or in matrix survival signals can trigger apoptosis.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Previously, we showed that an altered fibronectin matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here we report that this apoptotic mechanism is propagated by decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is linked to increased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and to decreased levels of p53.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	6	 FAK is physically and spatially linked to JNK and p53, which relocalize from the nucleus to the cell membrane to mediate this interaction.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Further, p53 participates in a feedback mechanism with JNK to regulate this apoptotic process and is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	8	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Alterations in the extracellular matrix during inflammation, development, or metastatic processes can alter the cellular biology that governs these processes.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Under these conditions, an altered matrix can result from proteolytic cleavage or alternative splicing of matrix molecules.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In inflammation, proteolysis of extracellular matrix molecules leads to the formation of fragments, such as fibronectin (FN)1 fragments, that elicit cellular responses different from those elicited by the intact molecule (1 to 5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	11	 For example, disease-associated fragments of FN trigger p53-mediated apoptosis of primary cells, but the intact molecule does not (6 to 8).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Similarly, alternatively spliced variants of FN elicit different cell responses, and specific domains of FN regulate cell survival (4, 5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	13	Previously we reported that an altered FN matrix triggers apoptosis in primary cells via a novel pathway that is regulated by transcriptionally mediated decreases in p53 and c-Myc levels in primary cells (5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To further decipher this apoptotic pathway, we explored the possible connections between integrin/FAK-mediated signals and the down-regulation of p53.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We hypothesized that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) might be at the crossroads of this signaling pathway, since FAK and associated focal adhesion proteins (Rac1/Pak1/MKK4/JNK) have been linked to p53 status in the apoptosis of primary cells (9, 10).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition, JNK can phosphorylate (11) and form a complex with p53 to stabilize it (12 to 16), thereby influencing its activity directly.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	17	FAK is an integrin-associated protein tyrosine kinase that is important in integrin signaling.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Its activation, triggered by increased phosphorylation of Tyr397 and other sites, has been implicated in many cellular processes, including cell survival.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The N-terminal domain of FAK directs interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	20	 FAK also has a central catalytic domain, which contains Tyr397, a major autophosphorylation site and a site of interaction with the Src homology 2 domain.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Its C-terminal noncatalytic domain, also known as FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK), contains sites for multiple protein-protein interactions and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Both FRNK and FAT act in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit cell spreading and migration and growth factor-mediated signals to mitogen-activated protein kinase (17).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	23	JNK, a group of mitogen-activated protein kinases that are activated by cytokines or environmental stress, participate in various signaling pathways, including apoptotic pathways.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	24	 JNK proteins are encoded by three genes, JNK1 (46 kDa), JNK2 (54 kDa), and JNK3 (54 kDa), each of which undergoes alternative splicing to express various isoforms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	25	 JNK is activated by phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (18).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Activated JNK1 can modify p53 posttranslationally by phosphorylation.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	27	 JNK2 and JNK3 can also phosphorylate p53, and all three associate with p53 in vivo (19).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	28	In this study, we sought to determine whether FAK signaling pathways communicate with p53 via JNK interactions in an altered matrix environment.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Here we report that the apoptotic mechanism triggered by an altered FN matrix is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation that are linked to increased phosphorylation of JNK and to decreased levels of p53, which is oppositely regulated by JNK1 and JNK2.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In this study, we demonstrate that this signaling mechanism is propagated by decreases in FAK phosphorylation, likely mediated by Tyr397, which are linked to increases in JNK phosphorylation and decreases in p53 protein levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Furthermore, JNK1 and JNK2 had opposite effects in regulating p53, which appeared to participate in a feedback mechanism with JNK to facilitate this apoptotic process (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	180	Several studies have shown that JNK interacts with (13, 14) and can phosphorylate p53 (11).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In fact, p53 and JNK can form a complex, and JNK is a regulator of p53 stability (13 to 16).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In one study, sustained activation of JNK1 down-regulated p53 expression during apoptosis (16), similar to our findings.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, we found that JNK1 and JNK2 are opposite regulators of p53.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Surprisingly, treatment with antisense JNK2 suppressed p53 levels in controls and under altered FN matrix conditions.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	185	 JNK1 antisense treatment, however, increased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	186	 P53 expression was also suppressed in jnk2-deficient cells.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These data indicate that JNK2 expression is tightly linked to that of p53 and that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate p53 by different mechanisms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Furthermore, increases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) decreased p53 protein levels, and decreases in JNK1 expression (or pJNK1) increased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Conversely, increases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) may increase p53 levels, and decreases in JNK2 expression (or pJNK2) profoundly decreased p53 levels.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Thus JNK1 is a negative regulator and JNK2 is a positive regulator of p53 expression.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	191	The antibody we used to detect pJNK also detects JNK1, -2, and -3, and Western blots for pJNK showed two bands at 54 and 46 kDa.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	192	 For several reasons, however, we are confident that treatment with an altered FN matrix increased JNK1 phosphorylation only and not that of JNK2 or JNK3.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	193	 First, transfection with a JNK1 construct (Fig.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	195	 3B) both showed an increase in the two bands visible in the pJNK Western blots under control conditions, indicating that both bands are JNK1 isoforms.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Second, treatment with a JNK1 antisense oligonucleotide decreased both bands, indicating that they are both JNK1 isoforms (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Third, transfection with a JNK2 construct induced a new higher molecular mass band at 54 kDa for pJNK that was not seen before with any other treatments and likely represents the phosphorylated form of JNK2 (Fig.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Fourth, Western analysis of jnk2-deficient cells showed two bands that likely represent two isoforms of JNK1.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These bands were not seen in Western blots of cells deficient in JNK1 and JNK2.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	200	Interestingly, overexpression of p53 limited the phosphorylation of JNK normally induced by an altered FN matrix, suggesting that p53 and pJNK participate in a negative feedback mechanism.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Similarly, in previous studies, introduction of p53 into p53-null cells reduced JNK activity to a low basal level (24), possibly indicating feedback between p53 and JNK.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	202	JNKs are a family of stress-related kinases, and an altered FN matrix represents a stressful condition in which JNKs seems to play a role.

0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Previously, we found that a proteolytic 40-kDa fragment of FN associated with the most advanced disease also induced apoptosis of periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro by down-regulating p53 and c-Myc (6, 7).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This 40-kDa fragment, which is comparable with the recombinant FN fragment we tested here, induced apoptosis of fibroblasts via a novel alternative pathway that involves decreases in FAK phosphorylation and down-regulation of p53 and c-Myc.
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This pathway appears to be triggered by cooperative interactions between integrins and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (4, 5).
0.48235416.15778501.html.plaintext.txt	209	 From the present findings we can further add that this inflammation-associated apoptotic pathway also involves interactions between pFAK and JNK1 and -2 and their phosphorylated isoforms, which oppositely regulate p53 expression levels.
