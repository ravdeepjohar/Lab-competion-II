0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	209	DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Here present new insights function hGTSE 1 recently characterized negative regulator p53 27
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	210	We provide evidence hGTSE 1 nucleo cytoplasmic shuttling protein becomes stabilized accumulates nucleus DNA damage independently p53 status
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	211	We show hGTSE 1 nuclear export depends C terminal NES mutated increases nuclear localization
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	212	Interestingly hGTSE 1 overexpression enhances cytoplasmic localization p53 requiring intact NES functional Mdm2 efficiently exert function
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	213	In unstressed cells number positive negative regulators maintain steady state level p53
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	214	Under stress conditions p53 activated variety post translational modifications altogether lead rapid stabilization accumulation nucleus 7
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	215	These modifications usually necessary association p53 factors involved stabilization activation Pin 1 40 andor dissociation factors negatively regulate p53 like Mdm2 JNK 41 42
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	216	On contrary post damage recovery negative regulators play critical role regulating p53 levels activity restore steady state function
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	217	It hypothesized recovery phase requests regulators like hGTSE 1 addition established ones
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	218	In report show hGTSE 1 protein levels increase response several DNA damaging agents
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	219	Because recently demonstrated hGTSE 1 expression attenuates DNA damage induced apoptosis controlling p53 function 27 increased levels hGTSE 1 protein DNA damage may involved negative feedback regulation p53 signaling pathway
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	220	Consistent model siRNA mediated regulation hGTSE 1 sensitizes cells p53 dependent apoptosis upon DNA damage 27
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	221	Thus hGTSE 1 may play important role DNA damage response preventing prolonged p53 activation
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	222	Further analysis behavior hGTSE 1 allowed us show DNA damage hGTSE 1 clearly relocalized cytoplasm nucleus
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	223	Time course experiments performed dissect kinetics hGTSE 1 enhanced expression nuclear accumulation DNA damage indicate occur slower rate compared p53 stabilization activation p21Waf 1 induction
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	224	This observation could imply early time points DNA damage hGTSE 1 interfere p53 response rather could play critical role controlling later phase p53 response likely post damage recovery phase
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	225	We show hGTSE 1 actively shuttles cytoplasm nucleus evidenced nuclear export inhibitor LMB caused clear nuclear accumulation hGTSE 1
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	226	Furthermore mutation C terminal NES hGTSE 1 NES enhanced hGTSE 1 nuclear localization
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	227	Shuttling activity hGTSE 1 therefore emerged potentially critical mechanism controlling p53 localization stability
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	228	In line hypothesis coexpression hGTSE 1 p53 used GFP tagged protein resulted increased cytoplasmic distribution p53 compared localization p53 alone
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	229	hGTSE 1 known interact p53 region mapped amino acids 355 393 27 two NLS located 7
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	230	Mdm2 dependent ubiquitination lysine residues found within NLSs results enhanced cytoplasmic localization p53 23 suggesting modification region could lead p53 nuclear export
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	231	In context physical interaction hGTSE 1 p53 could affect region enhancing p53 cytoplasmic localization
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	232	Importantly hGTSE 1 shuttling activity required promote p53 localization cytoplasm
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	233	Our results clearly demonstrate NES defective hGTSE 1 failed enhancing p53 distribution cytoplasm although ability associate p53 comparable WT hGTSE 1
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	234	It therefore conceivable cytoplasmic redistribution p53 enhanced hGTSE 1 merely alterations modifications C terminal domain p53 caused interaction rather data also indicate requirement hGTSE 1 shuttling activity
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	235	Interestingly Mdm2 known efficiently promote p53 nuclear exclusion 11 12 also required hGTSE 1 effect p53 localization observed hGTSE 1 WT shows impaired ability relocalizing p53 Mdm2 deficient cells
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	236	Similarly observed p53 relocalization intact NES functional Mdm2 seem required hGTSE 1 regulation p53 protein levels indicating relationship ability hGTSE 1 relocalize p53 cytoplasm regulate stability
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	237	Moreover inhibition proteasome activity prevents p53 protein regulation hGTSE 1 expression indicating cytoplasmic localization p53 could accompanied proteasome dependent degradation
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	238	The Mdm2 ring finger domain ability ubiquitinate p53 shown critical promoting p53 nuclear export 11 12 degradation cytoplasm 10 38
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	239	The possibility hGTSE 1 could promote p53 nuclear export enhancing Mdm2 dependent ubiquitination p53 seem consistent data detectable increase p53 ubiquitination observed vivo ubiquitination assay data shown
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	240	We thus favor hypothesis hGTSE 1 accelerates p53 nuclear export process Mdm2 dependent ubiquitination
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	241	Nuclear accumulated hGTSE 1 looses ability regulate localization levels p53 demonstrated using NES defective hGTSE 1
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	242	Therefore could hypothesize nuclear accumulation hGTSE 1 response DNA damage could phosphorylation dependent mechanism inactivating NES function
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	243	Subsequently post damage recovery phase reactivation hGTSE 1 NES activity dephosphorylation could required efficient regulatory function hGTSE 1 p53
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	244	It conceivable similar function hGTSE 1 takes place unstressed cells cell cycle shown control basal p53 levels preferentially S G2 phases 27
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	245	Moreover p53 localization reported change cell cycle increased cytoplasmic distribution S G2 43 44 coincident hGTSE 1 highest expression
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	246	Together data could suggest physiological function hGTSE 1 regulating p53 stability nuclear exclusion p53 unstressed cells possibly specific phases cell cycle require additional stringent negative regulators
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	247	Our results indicate DNA damage hGTSE 1 stabilized independently p53 status suggesting response damage hGTSE 1 could play specific functions parallel involving p53 regulation
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	248	In fact ability hGTSE 1 regulate cell cycle progression p53 independent 27
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	249	Other proteins JNK 42 Pin 1 40 p38 kinase 45 play role p53 signaling although regulation depend p53 thus suggesting p53 function tightly controlled independent signaling pathways
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	250	We present possible mechanism hGTSE 1 regulate p53 DNA damage highlighting relevance nucleo cytoplasmic shuttling activity functional requirement Mdm2
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	251	hGTSE 1 like mouse homologue GTSE 1 cell cycle regulated protein maintains S G2 specific expression even induced DNA damaging agents 25
0.51632494.14707141.html.plaintext.txt	252	We therefore propose role hGTSE 1 part negative feedback loop involved control DNA damage specific phases cell cycle require effective means regulate p53 activity levels
