0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A nonapeptide (16L1) was derived from the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) major capsid protein and tested for detection of potential cross-reactive serum IgG and cervical IgA antibodies in low- and high-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and cervical cancer patients by ELISA.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The IgG response was similar in women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and controls (P=0 1).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In contrast, more than 90 % of patients with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL were seropositive.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although tumours from cancer patients were all positive for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA, the level of seropositivity decreased significantly in this group (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Cervical IgA antibodies were also detected in a significantly high proportion of women with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL compared with controls.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the proportion of IgA-positive patients was lower than the proportion of IgG seropositives.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In conclusion, the 16L1 peptide appears to be a high-risk type-common epitope that induces cross-reactive antibodies in high-risk, but not low-risk, HPV-associated LSIL patients, allowing differentiation of high- and low-risk infected women at this stage of infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Infection of the genital epithelium with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted disease.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that  low-risk  HPV genotypes, mainly types 6 and 11, induce benign genital warts.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In contrast,  high-risk  genotypes, including HPV-16, -18 and related types, are associated with the development of cervical cancer (Walboomers et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Cervical cancer is still one of the most prevalent cancers in the developing world (Parkin et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	15	 HPV-16 and related types (31, 33, 52, 58 and 35), together with HPV-18 and related types (45, 59, 39 and 68), are associated with 91 % of cervical tumours in Central and South America (Bosch et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, early detection of genital infections by these high-risk HPV types would be of value for the prevention of cervical cancer.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	17	Genital HPV infection frequently induces antibody-mediated immune responses, mostly directed against the viral capsid (Wang et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The HPV capsid is composed of two structural proteins, a largely internal minor capsid protein (L2) and a major protein (L1), which is 30 times more abundant than L2 (Kirnbauer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 1993) and represents about 80 % of the total viral protein.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	20	 L1 is an important target of the immune system.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Immunological assays based on the use of HPV capsids are known to detect type-restricted antibodies, possibly due to the presentation of type-specific conformational epitopes.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Interestingly, the HPV-16 capsid exposes not only type-restricted but also type-common antigenic epitopes (Heino et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Thus, in addition to specific antibodies (Cason et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1992), widely cross-reactive antibodies have been found to react against peptide sequences on the L1 protein of both high- and low-risk HPV types (LeCann et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	25	We have previously described a peptide (IHSMNSTIL) derived from the HPV-16 L1 protein (16L1 peptide) that binds to HLA class I allele B*3901 and elicits proliferative responses in lymphocytes from patients with cervical cancer associated with either HPV-16 or -18 (Monroy-Garcia et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Further analysis of this peptide using Lipman and Pearson's ALIGN program showed that the sequence presented a substantial amino acid identity with the corresponding sequence in HPV-18 (88 9 % identity), HPV-16-related types (77 8 to 66 7 % identity) and HPV-18-related types (88 9 to 66 7 % identity).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Interestingly, comparison with the corresponding sequences in HPV-6 and -11 demonstrated an identity level of 55 6 %.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This observation raised the question of whether antibodies generated against these sequences could cross-react with the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This study aimed to evaluate the anti-peptide reactivity of antibodies produced in patients with high-risk HPV-associated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and cervical cancer and to compare it with the reaction of antibodies from women with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL to assess their potential cross-reactivity.

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Groups A, B and C consisted of independent groups of patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Group A included patients infected with any of the low-risk HPV types detected by the hybrid capture kit.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Groups B and C comprised patients infected with any of the high-risk HPV types detected by the hybrid capture test, including HPV-16.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Group D contained samples that tested positive for the high-risk hybrid capture test and were subsequently proved positive for the presence of HPV-16 by PCR.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Characteristics of the groups of patients included in the study.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	112	The presence or absence of HPV DNA was verified using the general MY09/MY11 primers for PCR.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Low- and high-risk types were determined by hybrid capture test.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	114	 HPV-16 was detected using the Pr3/Pr4 type-specific primers for PCR.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Clinical diagnosis was based on cytological analysis and was corroborated by histopathological analysis.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	116	  We first investigated the presence of IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide in serum samples.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	117	 A small proportion of patients with low-risk HPV-associated LSIL (6 5 %) tested positive for the presence of IgG antibodies.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This proportion was similar to the proportion of seropositive individuals in the normal population (P=0 1) (Fig.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In contrast, more than 90 % of patients infected with high-risk HPV were positive for the presence of IgG.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The difference between this group and the negative controls was highly significant (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Moreover, the mean signal strength of antibody response in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients was 3 7-fold higher than the mean signal strength in control samples.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	122	 PCR analysis of DNA from high-risk HPV-associated LSIL samples indicated that 60 8 % of patients were infected with HPV-16, while 17 4 % were infected with HPV-18 and 21 6 % with other high-risk types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	123	 However, the proportion of seropositive subjects in each group was similar (P > 0 1) (Table 2).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This seemed to indicate that most LSIL patients infected by high-risk HPV types produced antibodies that reacted against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, we next addressed the question of whether these antibodies could also be found in patients who had developed a high-risk HPV-associated cervical tumour.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Results showed that only 57 7 % of cervical cancer patients had antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The proportion of seropositive subjects in the cervical cancer group was significantly higher than that observed in the negative controls (P < 0 0001).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, seropositivity in cervical cancer patients was significantly lower than that detected in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients (P < 0 0001).

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	140	 As shown in Table 3, the 16L1 peptide-based ELISA was able to detect a high proportion (91 6 %) of LSIL patients who were actually infected with high-risk HPV types and produced low levels of false-positive and false-negative results.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The probability that an LSIL patient is infected with high-risk HPV types, given a positive ELISA value, was high (positive predictive value=97 7 %).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	142	 However, the probability of not being infected with high-risk genotypes, given a negative ELISA result, was lower (negative predictive value=87 7 %).

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Once more, ELISAs revealed that LSIL patients infected with low-risk HPV genotypes were largely negative for the presence of anti-16L1 peptide antibodies (Fig.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In addition, IgA reactivity in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL population was significantly higher than that observed in the negative-control group and in the low-risk HPV group.

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Interestingly, when all patients diagnosed with LSIL were analysed together, no difference was detected between the IgG and IgA responses (P=0 06).
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	163	 However, separate analysis of LSIL patients infected by low- or high-risk HPV types showed that the proportion of cervical IgA responders was significantly higher than the proportion of IgG seropositives in the group of patients infected by low-risk HPV types.

0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	168	     DISCUSSION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In the present work, we have shown that IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide can be found in sera from LSIL patients infected with high-risk HPV types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Antibodies against HPV 16L1-derived peptides have been demonstrated previously (Cason et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of a peptide-based serological assay capable of differentiating low-risk from high-risk HPV infections in LSIL patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Previously, a conformation-dependent HPV 16L1 epitope was suggested to be an immunodominant site recognized by most human sera following HPV infection (Wang et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This site turned out to be a major neutralizing epitope on HPV-16 (White et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	173	, 1999) that seemed to induce an antibody response in more than 75 % of infected patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Nevertheless, this epitope covers non-contiguous regions of the capsid surface, making its use difficult as a detection reagent for early HPV infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	175	Serological studies, using virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigenic targets, have demonstrated that the majority of women infected with HPV-16 produce an IgG antibody response (Kirnbauer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Here, we found that most women with high-risk HPV type-associated LSIL generated systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, antibodies detected in VLP-based assays are mainly type restricted and directed against conformational epitopes (Christensen et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Therefore, it might be possible that anti-16L1 and anti-VLP antibodies are generated in parallel as a response against infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	179	 To ascertain whether these antibodies co-exist in infected humans, the population studied herein is currently being tested in a VLP-based ELISA.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	180	It is generally accepted that IgG antibodies against HPV capsid antigens are long lasting (Af Geijersstam et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	181	, 2000) and may be a marker of past and current infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	182	 From the information presented in Table 3, it appears that systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are good indicators of current infection.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Nevertheless, we cannot conclude this, because we did not analyse women with a previous history of HPV infection and the number of seropositive patients who were negative for the presence of viral DNA was too small.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	184	 To ascertain whether antibodies against the 16L1 peptide are markers of prior infection, it will be necessary to test groups of currently non-infected women, who had a previous infection that was either treated successfully or cleared naturally.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	185	 On the other hand, we observed that a small proportion of patients with LSIL were seronegative, regardless of the presence of HPV DNA.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	186	 With reference to this, an earlier study of incident HPV infection demonstrated that some women with a persistent HPV infection never seroconverted (Carter et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thus, it is possible that the seronegative patients detected in this work do not produce antibodies against the peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	188	Here we demonstrated that IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide were detected in sera from most LSIL patients infected with high-risk HPV types and were almost absent in low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and uninfected women.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In as much as HPV infection is associated with risk factors such as age and sexual activity (Giuliano et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	190	, 1999), it could be postulated that the apparent cross-reactivity between high-risk HPV types might reflect shared epidemiological risk factors.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This is unlikely, because the epidemiological data presented in Table 1 showed that mean values for age, number of sexual partners and pregnancies were similar between high- and low-risk HPV-associated LSIL and even non-infected women.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	192	 This suggests strongly that the antibodies detected are not associated with these risk factors.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Another possibility might be that patients included in the high-risk HPV-associated LSIL group were previously infected with HPV-16.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	194	 To determine whether previous HPV-16 infection occurred in these women, a study of the presence of HPV-16 DNA in archive tissue samples is warranted.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	195	A more likely explanation might be that the difference in antibody responses is associated with the level of sequence conservation of the peptide region.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	196	 This hypothesis is supported by previous work in which antibodies raised against a peptide sequence containing the 16L1 peptide reacted with HPV-16 VLPs but not with HPV-11 VLPs (Heino et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The 16L1 peptide is located within the structure of the h2 and h3 -helices of the C-terminal laterally projecting domain of L1 (Chen et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	198	 They form, together with the h4 helix, the surface of contact with other L1 monomers.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Consequently, this site is important for the assembly of viral capsids and is relatively conserved among different HPV types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, comparison of the corresponding sequences in the high- and low-risk types detected by the hybrid capture test used in this work showed interesting differences.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	201	 For instance, all five low-risk types differed at three or more amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide sequence.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In contrast, only three of the 12 high-risk types differed at more than three amino acid positions from the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Moreover, changes at positions 1, 5 or 8 were found in four of five low-risk types, while only four of 12 high-risk types had these changes.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	204	We also observed that a high proportion of patients with cervical cancer were positive for the presence of systemic IgG antibodies against the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In an earlier study (Dillner et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	206	, 1990), IgG responses to peptides covering the complete amino acid sequence of the HPV-16 L1 protein were examined in sera from patients with cervical cancer.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Interestingly, a peptide region that included the 16L1 peptide sequence was demonstrated to be largely unreactive.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This divergence might be attributable to differences in the amino acid sequences.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	209	 (1990), the 16L1 peptide sequence was included as a part of a 20 amino acid peptide, which meant an extension of nine amino acids at the N terminus and one amino acid at the C terminus of the 16L1 peptide.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In this respect, there is evidence to indicate that recognition and binding of antibodies to a particular epitope are highly influenced by the extension of a peptide sequence.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In fact, extension of a single amino acid can induce a reduction in monoclonal antibody recognition of two to three orders of magnitude (Uray et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	212	, 2003), while an extension of 13 amino acids can result in complete loss of antibody binding (Calderon-Aranda et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Therefore, extensions of the 16L1 peptide might account for the lack of response observed in the former report.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	214	Interestingly, patients with high-risk HPV-associated invasive cervical cancer showed a reduced antibody response against the 16L1 peptide compared with high-risk HPV-associated LSIL.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	215	 In agreement with our results, previous studies have shown that IgG responses against different L1-derived peptides are significantly prevalent in patients with premalignant lesions (Sharma et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	216	, 1996), but are not associated with cervical cancer (Dillner et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Reduction of anti-peptide IgG responses in cervical cancer may be due to a natural decline in antibody titres that occurs over time in infected individuals (Andersson-Ellstrom et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	218	, 2000), or may be associated with a lack of antigen expression.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	219	 It is known that transcription of the L1 gene is restricted to terminally differentiated keratinocytes and that the level of cellular differentiation decreases as the grade of neoplasia increases (Stoler et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Consequently, the expression of the L1 protein is significantly reduced in advanced lesions associated with high-risk HPV genotypes (Melsheimer et al.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Furthermore, integration of HPV DNA in cervical cancer may cause disruption of the L1 gene (Walboomers  and  Meijer, 1997), affecting the expression of the L1 protein.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Indeed, integration of viral DNA occurs more frequently in HPV-18- than in HPV-16-associated tumours.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This is consistent with our observation that the prevalence of antibodies was lower in patients with HPV-18- than in patients with HPV-16-associated cervical cancer.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	224	In conclusion, our study indicates that the 16L1 peptide might be a high-risk type-common epitope capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies in high-risk HPV-associated LSIL patients.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Importantly, antibodies in LSIL patients infected with low-risk HPV types did not react against the peptide, suggesting that the reaction was restricted to high-risk virus types.
0.172249.15302958.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Although more extensive studies to investigate antibody responses against the 16L1 peptide are still required, our primary results suggest that the 16L1 peptide might be useful for the development of serological assays for the study of natural and vaccine-induced immune responses against high-risk HPV, as well as for the early detection of oncogenic HPV infections.

0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Type-specific HPV serology is currently based on virus-like particles (VLPs) with intact conformation.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Presence of incorrectly folded VLPs in VLP preparations is recognized as an important cause of cross-reactivity in HPV serology.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Heparin-coated microtitre plates were evaluated for capturing conformationally correct VLPs and improving the type specificity of HPV serology.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Hybrid VLPs between HPV16 and HPV11, which had been found to have significant reactivity with children's sera and a batch of HPV18 VLPs that had failed the quality control because of significant reactivity with sera from virginal women, were tested in parallel with heparin ELISA, ordinary ELISA and type-specific mAb capture ELISA.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Control sera from children that had detectable reactivity with HPV16/11 hybrid VLPs in ordinary ELISA did not react in heparin-based ELISA, but some hybrid VLPs also had background reactivity in capture ELISAs.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Control sera from virginal women that had some reactivity with a poor quality HPV18 VLP preparation in ordinary ELISA had no reactivity in heparin or capture ELISA, suggesting that certain VLP preparations expose cross-reactive epitopes that are not exposed on VLPs with heparin-binding ability.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As the sensitivity was similar or only marginally affected by the use of heparin plates, use of heparin-coated plates may improve the type specificity of VLP-based ELISAs and reduce interassay variability attributable to variable quality of different VLP batches.

0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	113	, 2003) we found that there was a remarkable difference in the level of antibody reactivity for three hybrid VLPs among HPV16 to /HPV11+ human sera, with H11 : 16[FG+HI] giving on average almost three times higher reactivity than HPV11, although similar amounts of VLPs (titrated to be optimal concentrations of VLP antigen) were used in each ELISA assay.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	114	 We suggested that this increased reactivity would be due to subtle differences in surface exposure of conformationally constrained epitopes on hybrid VLPs.

0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Also, the reactivity of serum samples from virginal women with low-quality HPV18 VLPs in direct ELISA was not detectable when the same VLPs were coated onto heparin-binding plates, implying that use of heparin-coated plates may improve HPV type specificity of VLP-based ELISAs and reduce interassay variability attributable to variable quality of VLP batches.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	147	The HPV11+/HPV16 to  human sera had very similar reactivity with HPV11 and HPV16/11 VLP hybrids that contained the HPV11 C terminus (H11 : 16[FG+HI] and H16 : 11[171 to 505]) in both heparin-based and direct ELISAs, suggesting that the major human serum-reactive HPV11 epitope(s) is present in these VLPs and that VLPs containing this epitope are heparin-binding.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	148	In contrast, the data for HPV16 were much less clear.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The reactivities were much lower in the heparin-based ELISAs and showed lower correlations with the reactivities against the parent virus when heparin-based ELISAs were used.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The hybrid virus H11 : 16[FG+HI] was unique in that adequate disruption appeared to require exceptionally harsh disruption methods.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Also, this VLP was the only one from which the results of heparin-based and capture ELISAs where distinctly different.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Capture ELISAs did not improve background reactivity with children's sera, whereas heparin ELISA did.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Conceivably, the artificial addition of the V5-binding site to an HPV11 backbone may have also resulted in the V5 epitope being exposed on incorrectly folded H11 : 16[FG+HI] VLPs.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	154	Quality control of ELISAs depends on maintaining intact VLPs of good quality and a quality assurance system.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We found that the mAbs that reacted with disrupted virus in direct ELISAs did not react with the same disrupted viruses if heparin-coated plates were used, suggesting that the use of heparin-coated microtitre plates could add a quality control component to the VLP-based ELISAs by preventing binding of denatured L1 antigen and contaminating protein.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Numerous approaches towards decreasing non-specific binding to ELISA plates have been described, notably the use of blocking with vinyl polymers (Studentsov et al.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The approach with heparin-coated plates has the advantage that a specific biological property of the virus is exploited to increase the specificity of binding.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	158	 VLPs of all HPV-types tested so far bind to heparin with similar efficiency (Rommel et al.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	159	, 2004), suggesting that heparin can be used as a universal capture molecule for HPV serology.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	160	In summary, heparin-coated plates will select a subset of VLPs with intact heparin-binding activity.
0.53923285.15604432.html.plaintext.txt	161	 At least for some HPVs, intact heparin-binding ability was found to be correlated with serological specificity, allowing for a straightforward and simple improvement of the performance of HPV serology.

0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The nature of the envelopment signal is unknown, but is thought to involve a conformational change at the surface of the capsid that facilitates interaction with HBV envelope proteins.

0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This suggests that the selection of replication-competent nucleocapsids for envelopment is not related to the capacity of DNA-containing core particles to bind specifically to HBV envelope proteins, and that there must be an alternative mechanism.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	7	   Main text Top Abstract Main text References   Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the hepadnaviruses, a family of small, enveloped viruses with partially double-stranded, circular DNA genomes that replicate by reverse transcription (Ganem  and  Varmus, 1987 ).
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	8	 During initiation of infection, virus particles deliver their DNA to the nucleus, where it is converted to a covalently closed, circular DNA molecule that acts as a transcriptional template for the production of an RNA genome (the pregenome) (Tuttleman et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The RNA pregenome and the viral polymerase are encapsidated in the cytoplasm by viral capsid proteins to form immature nucleocapsid particles within which viral DNA synthesis occurs.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Initially, a minus-strand DNA is synthesized by reverse transcription of the pregenome.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This minus-strand DNA is then used as a template for plus-strand synthesis (reviewed by Nassal, 1996 ).
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thereafter, nucleocapsids interact with surface proteins embedded in a lipid bilayer of a post-endoplasmic reticulum, pre-Golgi compartment and bud into the lumen of this compartment to form mature virions (Roingeard et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	13	, 1990 ; Bruss  and  Ganem, 1991 ; Huovila et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	14	Previous studies have shown that immature nucleocapsids containing pregenomic RNA are incompetent for envelopment and that minus-strand DNA synthesis must be completed for core particle envelopment to occur (Wei et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This suggests that DNA synthesis within the capsid is coupled to the appearance of a signal on the exterior of the nucleocapsid that is essential for nucleocapsid envelopment.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The molecular nature of this envelopment signal is unknown, but it is thought to involve the specific binding of DNA-containing core particles, but not of RNA-containing core particles, to HBV envelope proteins (Hui et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We have recently investigated the core to envelope interactions involved in the maturation of HBV, using in vitro assays to determine the capacity of HBV core particles to bind a panel of synthetic peptides that map to HBV envelope proteins (Poisson et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A short domain of the large (L) envelope protein (aa 96 to 116 in the ayw subtype) and a short domain in the cytosolic loop of the small (S) envelope protein (aa 56 to 80) were found to bind HBV core particles efficiently.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The L envelope domain found to interact with HBV core particles was subsequently shown to be essential for virion morphogenesis in two independent studies with envelope mutants, in which this domain was substituted by random sequence (Bruss, 1997 ) or deleted (Le Seyec et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A recent study with the S domain confirmed that deletions and/or amino acid substitutions within this domain hinder subviral particle morphogenesis and therefore provide no information about the role of this domain in virion packaging (Jenna  and  Sureau, 1998 ).
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	21	Our previous assays of the binding of HBV core particles to HBV envelope peptides were performed with purified, liver-derived core particles containing HBV DNA (Poisson et al.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In this study, we used similar assays to compare the binding of these DNA-containing core particles with that of empty HBV core particles, obtained by using the baculovirus expression system.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These particles, called HBV core particles, were obtained by expression of the sequence encoding the first 144 amino acids of the HBV core gene (excluding the arginine-rich C-terminal stretch of 39 amino acids responsible for pregenome binding) and have been described elsewhere (Touze et al.

0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We used two 25-residue peptides, S1 and S2, that together covered the cytosolic loop of the HBV S protein.
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To cover the cytosolic domain of the HBV L protein, we used five peptides of 28, 28, 29, 23 and 55 residues named L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5, respectively (L1 to L4 corresponded to the pre-S1 domain and L5 corresponded to the pre-S2 domain).
0.2416355.10725437.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Two additional peptides overlapping peptide L4 were used: peptide L4a (the last 10 residues of peptide L3 plus the first eight residues of peptide L4) and peptide L4b (the last 13 residues of peptide L4 plus the first eight residues of peptide L5).

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	5	   SUMMARY TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A recent and intriguing discovery in plant biology has been that some transcription factors can move between cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In Arabidopsis thaliana, the floral identity protein LEAFY has strong non-autonomous effects when expressed in the epidermis, mediated by its movement into underlying tissue layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	7	 By contrast, a structurally unrelated floral identity protein, APETALA1, has only limited non-autonomous effects.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Using GFP fusions to monitor protein movement in the shoot apical meristem and in floral primordia of Arabidopsis, we found a strong correlation between cytoplasmic localization of proteins and their ability to move to adjacent cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The graded distribution of several GFP fusions with their highest levels in the cells where they are produced is compatible with the notion that this movement is driven by diffusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We also present evidence that protein movement is more restricted laterally within layers than it is from L1 into underlying layers of the Arabidopsis apex.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Based on these observations, we propose that intercellular movement of transcription factors can occur in a non-targeted fashion as a result of simple diffusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This hypothesis raises the possibility that diffusion is the default state for many macromolecules in the Arabidopsis apex, unless they are specifically retained.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Intercellular communication is essential in determining and enforcing developmental fates in all multicellular organisms.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In animals, this process relies mainly on secreted signaling peptides, which interact with the extracellular matrix, and specific cell surface receptors.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The interaction first triggers a signal transduction response in the cytoplasm of the target cells, and eventually leads to changes in gene expression.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Complex protein-protein interactions and multiple protein phosphorylation steps are involved in many of these pathways, such as the EGF, TGFss, Notch, Hedgehog and WNT family signaling pathways.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An alternative form of communication is achieved by the diffusion of transcription factors from their sources to the target nuclei through a continuous cytoplasm, such as the syncytium of Drosophila blastoderm embryos, one of the best understood model systems for transcriptional regulation (Rivera-Pomar and Jackle, 1996).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, syncytial organization is restricted to only a few tissues in metazoans.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	20	Although plants lack homologs of the well-known metazoan peptide ligands, such as EGF, TGFss or Hedgehog, plant cells can also communicate via secreted molecules (Fletcher et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	21	, 2001; McCarty and Chory, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, in contrast to animals, cytoplasmic continuity between plant cells is the rule, not the exception.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Most plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata, plasma membrane-lined channels that provide cytoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Plasmodesmata, which are used in the transport of nutrients and signaling molecules including RNAs and proteins, can be divided into two major groups (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Haywood et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The primary plasmodesmata form during cytokinesis, whereas the secondary plasmodesmata develop between cells that are not necessarily clonally related.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The size exclusion limit (SEL) of the different types of plasmodesmata can be measured using fluorescent tracer molecules.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In most cases, plasmodesmata in younger tissues have larger SEL and are morphologically simpler than those in older tissue (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	28	Two modes of movement through plasmodesmata have been proposed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Targeted movement involves specific interactions between the transported macromolecules and plasmodesmata components.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This leads to an increase in the SEL and is therefore not limited by the endogenous SEL of a given cell.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	31	 By contrast, non-targeted movement resembles passive diffusion and is governed by the endogenous SEL of the plasmodesmata involved (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Imlau et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The best understood case of targeted movement is probably the trafficking of plant viral movement proteins (MPs), which can move over long distances in plants and are key to the spreading of plant viral infections.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	33	 A good example of non-targeted movement is provided by green fluorescent protein (GFP).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Using transient transfection by bombardment, it has been shown that native GFP can move several cells away from its source.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition to the SEL, multimerization and the addition of nuclear or ER localization signals can hinder, or even prevent, GFP from leaving the source cell (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	36	Apart from viral proteins, studies of macromolecule movement in plants have focused traditionally on long-distance transport of photosynthates and larger molecules or complexes through the phloem (Lucas, 1995; Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A good example is the sucrose transporter SUT1, whose mRNA is transported into the phloem before it is translated (Kuhn et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Moreover, grafting experiments have demonstrated the existence of long-distance mRNA movement in plants (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	39	 More recently, studies conducted in several plant species have demonstrated that non-cell-autonomous effects of transcription factors involved in plant development can be mediated by protein movement (reviewed by Haywood et al.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Most plant organs originate post-embryonically from meristems, which include stem cells set aside during embryogenesis.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In the aerial part of the plant, new organs emerge from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which consists of three tissue layers, L1-L3.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In leaf injection experiments, not only was KN1 transported to the surrounding tissue through plasmodesmata, but KN1 also increased the SEL of plasmodesmata, enabling the transport of kn1 sense RNA and protein complexes (Kragler et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	45	 KN1 can also move away from its source of expression when expressed from heterologous promoters in Arabidopsis (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	46	 There is similar evidence that the Antirrhinum MADS-box transcription factor DEFICIENS (DEF) moves from inner to outer tissue layers in developing flowers, although the extent of movement is stage- and organ-dependent (Perbal et al.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Further studies using transgenic misexpression confirmed that movement of SHR from the root stele to endodermis is required for endodermis development (Nakajima et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	52	 RNA of the plant-specific transcription factor LFY is expressed in all three layers of young floral primordia, which are mis-specified as shoots in strong lfy mutants (Weigel et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Surprisingly, LFY RNA expression in the L1 of developing flowers is sufficient to fully rescue the lfy-mutant phenotype.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In such transgenic plants, LFY protein, but not LFY RNA, is detected in all layers of the rescued flowers, indicating that LFY protein moves from the L1 into inner layers (Sessions et al.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Here, we characterize the mode of LFY movement in Arabidopsis SAMs and floral primordia.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Using functional LFY-GFP fusion proteins, we show that LFY moves more readily from the L1 into deeper cell layers than laterally into adjacent, clonally related cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	59	 By contrast, a functional AP1-GFP fusion is unable to move from its source cells.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Comparison of the dynamics of LFY-GFP fusion proteins with other GFP fusions suggests that this movement is driven by diffusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Deletion experiments failed to identify a specific movement signal in LFY, which is compatible with the conclusion that LFY movement is non-targeted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The hypothesis of non-targeted movement is also supported by the finding of a correlation between cytoplasmic localization and the ability of these proteins to move to adjacent cells.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The subcellular localization of GFP:AP1 was also abnormal; instead of being exclusively nuclear like the functional AP1:GFP fusion, it produced a mostly cytoplasmic signal.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The cytoplasmic localization may well be causally related to the ability of this fusion to move and to the inability to rescue the mutant phenotype; however, it is unlikely that movement itself interferes with AP1 function.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Western blots probed with an anti-GFP antibody showed that both fusions migrated at approximately 52 kDa (expected size 55 kDa; arrow, Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	192	Movement of LFY-GFP fusions from the L1 layer To avoid artifacts caused by the addition of GFP to a specific domain of the LFY protein, we generated three different LFYGFP fusions: GFP:LFY, an N-terminal fusion; GLFY, with an insertion of GFP at amino acid 31; and LFY:GFP, a C-terminal fusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	193	 We used these fusions, which increase the size of LFY by about half, from 47 to 74 kDa, to further characterize the movement of LFY, which has been previously detected using anti-LFY antibodies (Sessions et al.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	196	 All five transgenes were able to rescue the lfy-12 mutant phenotype, and to cause the typical gain-of-function phenotypes associated with overexpression of LFY (Weigel and Nilsson, 1995), which indicates that the three GFP fusions were fully functional.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	197	Using the ML1 promoter lines, we examined the subcellular localization of the LFY-GFP fusions, as well as their movement from the L1 layer (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	198	 All three fusions were detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which was best seen in leaf epidermal cells (GLFY shown in Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	202	 GLFY and GFP:LFY moved three to four cell layers into the L2 and L3 in both the vegetative and inflorescence apices, forming a gradient with the highest concentration in the L1 (Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Overall, LFY:GFP appeared more cytoplasmic than GLFY and GFP:LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This observation was confirmed by quantifying the total signal intensity in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the epidermal cells of emerging leaves from all three fusions (see Materials and Methods).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	208	 For GLFY and GFP:LFY, the nuclear to cytoplasmic signal ratios were very similar, 1:2.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	209	 By contrast, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of LFY:GFP was 1:5.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	210	4, a twofold increase compared with GLFY and GFP:LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Western blots probed with an anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that there was little degradation of the fusion proteins, indicating that the in vivo fluorescence signal came from the intact fusion proteins (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Taken together, the behavior of LFY-GFP fusions is intermediate between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGPF, both with respect to their cytoplasmic localization and their ability to move from the L1 layer.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	219	  Lateral movement of GLFY within tissue layers Movement of LFY-GFP fusions from the L1 to deeper layers indicated that they can pass through the secondary plasmodesmata, which connect cells that are not clonally related.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	220	 To study the lateral movement of LFY within each tissue layer, we took advantage of a mutated enhancer from the AGAMOUS (AG) gene, which drives reporter gene expression in the inflorescence meristem in addition to the normal AG domain in the center of floral meristems (Hong et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	221	We expressed 2xGFP, NLS:2xGFP and GLFY under the control of the CaMV 35S minimal promoter fused to the mutated AG enhancer (AG intron*).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Except for the subcellular localization, the expression patterns of NLS:2xGFP (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	223	 5B) were indistinguishable, with fluorescent signal in the inflorescence meristem and central domain of young floral primordia.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The signal in both the shoot and floral meristems had discrete boundaries, indicating that GFP neither moved from the inflorescence meristem into emerging floral primordia, nor moved from the center of stage 3 flowers to the periphery (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	225	 However, a gradient of 2xGFP could be seen extending into deeper cell layers in L3 in stage 3 flowers (Fig.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	226	 5E), which is consistent with our earlier observation.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Thus, compared with movement from the L1 to internal layers, lateral movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within tissue layers is much more limited, or possibly even absent.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The much reduced movement of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP within L1 and L2, compared with movement between layers, suggests that the plasmodesmata SEL within these two layers is lower than that between layers.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We have previously found that periclinal, as well as anticlinal, sectors of LFY can rescue mutant parts of flowers, indicating that LFY moves in both directions (Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	239	 One possibility for the apparently different behavior of LFY and GLFY is that the greater size of GLFY, compared with endogenous LFY, reduces its ability to move laterally within tissue layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	240	We used a functional assay to test this assumption.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	241	 For this, we took advantage of the fact that the mutated AG enhancer is active in lfy mutants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	242	 When we expressed LFY and GLFY under the control of this enhancer in lfy-12 plants, the same fraction of transgenic lines showed rescue in flowers (4 out of 12 lines for LFY and 4 out of 11 lines for GLFY; no significant difference using Fisher's exact test), suggesting that GLFY has similar activity to LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, the rescued flowers differed in phenotype.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Both GLFY and LFY rescued the development of the two inner whorls, which contain stamens and carpels, and in which the AG enhancer is active (Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	246	 All four of the lfy-12; AG intron*::LFY lines that showed phenotypic rescue produced at least some flowers with petals, and many flowers had the normal complement of four petals.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	247	 By contrast, none of the four lfy-12; AG intron*::GLFY lines produced flowers with petals.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	248	 As GLFY appears to be as active as LFY in the inner two whorls where it is produced, the difference in their activity in the outer two whorls is consistent with the conclusion that LFY can move more extensively than GLFY.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	254	, 2000) (this work), it is unclear whether LFY movement is required for normal flower development, because LFY protein and RNA are expressed throughout young flowers (Parcy et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The difference between LFY and GLFY in their apparent ability to move within layers allowed us to address this question by expressing LFY and GLFY under the control of the LFY promoter and comparing their ability to rescue lfy-12 mutants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Of ten LFY::LFY transgenic lines in the lfy-12 background, three showed complete rescue, and the remaining seven showed nearly complete rescue, with only a few flowers having reduced petal or stamen number.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	257	 By contrast, only six out of fourteen LFY::GLFY lines in the lfy-12 background showed a similar degree of rescue; the remaining eight lines resembled weak or intermediate lfy mutants and were sterile.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This difference between their ability to rescue is statistically significant based on Fisher's exact test.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Although only the opposite result  to  full ability of movement-compromised LFY to rescue lfy mutants  to  would have been entirely conclusive, our finding is consistent with the notion that LFY movement may be required for normal flower development.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	260	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that GLFY is somewhat less active as a transcription factor than native LFY, although no difference in activity could be observed when tested from the 35S and AtML1 promoters.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	261	Movement of mutant LFY proteins To further test whether LFY movement is regulated, we investigated whether deleting parts of the LFY protein abolishes intercellular movement.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	270	 GFP:LFY3, with a C-terminal deletion, showed the least degree of movement, moving only one to two cell layers from the L1 (Fig.

0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	293	     DISCUSSION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Since the discovery of transcription factor movement in plants almost a decade ago, questions have arisen regarding how they move and whether movement is regulated.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	294	 There are at least two scenarios for how transcription factors reach neighboring cells: targeted movement guided by a specific movement or export signal, or non-targeted movement by diffusion (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	295	 We have performed several tests to determine whether there is evidence for targeted movement of LFY.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	296	 None of our results point to specific regulation of LFY movement, which suggests that LFY movement is non-targeted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Furthermore, we have found important differences in the dynamics of apical-basal and lateral movement in the apex.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	298	Mode of LFY movement Several lines of evidence are compatible with the view that LFY movement is non-targeted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	299	 First, GFP-LFY fusions produced in the L1 formed limited gradients extending into deeper layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Their movement range was between that of 2xGFP and NLS:2xGFP, which move in a non-targeted fashion (Crawford and Zambryski, 1999; Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This is in contrast to the nearly uniform distribution in the shoot apex (reflecting an active mechanism of cell-to-cell transport) that is observed when a viral movement protein fusion is expressed in the L1.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Second, size affects LFY movement, as native LFY was more effective in rescuing lfy defects in adjacent cells in the same tissue layer than the larger GLFY fusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The effect of size is one of the prominent characteristics of non-targeted movement (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Third, although differing in stability and sub-cellular localization, all three GFP-LFY truncations and fusions of four mutant lfy alleles were able to move from the L1 into interior cell layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Although one cannot exclude the possibility that LFY has several redundant movement signals, the simpler explanation is that the LFY protein sequence does not contain a specific movement or export signal.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	306	It has been suggested that non-targeted movement, like targeted movement, occurs through plasmodesmata.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The potential localization of foci of GFP-LFY fusion proteins along the cell wall in the leaf epidermis supports this hypothesis.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	308	 This also suggests that the size exclusion limit of the secondary plasmodesmata connecting tissue layers in the Arabidopsis apex is greater than 74 kDa (the size of the LFY-GFP fusions), which is consistent with previous estimates for nascent leaves (Zambryski and Crawford, 2000).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	309	Movement within and between tissue layers An important new finding is that GFP variants, as well as GLFY, move more easily in the apical-basal direction than laterally.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Using in vivo function as a criterion, we found that the GLFY fusion was less efficient than the native LFY in moving from the center of floral primordia to the periphery.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	311	 This functional difference is most likely a result of their size difference, because both proteins are fully functional in the cells where they are produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Similar to previous studies that have demonstrated that the inner central zone (L3) does not allow fluorescent tracer uploading from the vascular tissue (Gisel et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	313	, 2002), we observed much more limited lateral movement within the L3.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Thus, intercellular movement needs to be considered in the context of the specific location and developmental stage within the plant.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	315	That lateral movement is less easily achieved than apical-basal movement may also explain the fact that LFY does not move out of floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem in wild type (Parcy et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	316	, 2000), as lateral movement would be required for efficient protein exchange between the two tissues.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The inflorescence meristem may even form a symplasmic domain that is insulated from emerging floral primordia (Rinne and van der Schoot, 1998), thus restricting movement of all macromolecules.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Alternatively, there may be selective gating, such that movement of only certain macromolecules from floral primordia into the inflorescence meristem (and vice versa) is permitted.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	319	 A similar mechanism may also be responsible for maintaining discrete whorl boundaries within the flower.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	320	 In this context, it is noteworthy that floral homeotic proteins that are expressed in distinct whorls of the developing Arabidopsis flower, such as AP1 and AP3, do not move, whereas LFY, which is expressed throughout the flower, does (Jenik and Irish, 2001; Sessions et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	321	Movement and subcellular localization LFY and LFY-GFP fusions can move into the inner tissue layers from the L1.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	322	 By contrast, AP1:GFP does not move between tissue layers.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	323	 This cannot be simply due to size, because an N-terminal fusion, GFP:AP1, could move well.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Furthermore, GFP:AP1 (55 kDa) is smaller than either NLS:2xGFP (57 kDa) or LFY-GFP fusions (74 kDa).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Therefore, if LFY is moving by diffusion, AP1 and AP1:GFP must be actively retained in the cells where they are expressed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	326	 One way to achieve the retention may be by subcellular localization, such as nuclear or ER localization.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	327	 From this study, we have found that there is a good correlation between nuclear localization and movement: 2xGFP, which is highly cytoplasmic, can move a considerable distance from the L1, and the same is true for the predominantly cytoplasmic GFP:AP1 fusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	328	 AP1:GFP, which appeared to be exclusively nuclear, did not move.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Between these two extremes, NLS:2xGFP showed little cytoplasmic localization and moved only one cell layer.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The GFP-LFY fusions all showed more cytoplasmic localization than NLS:2xGFP, and all moved farther than NLS:2xGFP but less than 2xGFP.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Among the three GFP-LFY fusions, LFY:GFP had the most cytoplasmic localization and moved the farthest.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	332	Another possible mechanism for retaining a protein could be through the formation of large protein complexes with more exclusive subcellular localization, or simply with sizes above the SEL of plasmodesmata.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This may contribute to the retention of MADS domain proteins such as AP1, as several of them, including AP1, are known to form heteromultimers in the absence of DNA (Egea-Cortines et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	334	 In addition, it has been shown that AP3, a MADS-domain transcription factor that does not move between tissue layers, needs to heterodimerize with another MADS-domain protein, PISTILLATA (PI), in order to localize to the nucleus (McGonigle et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	335	 It is possible that the GFP:AP1 fusion disrupts such interactions, thereby interfering with biological activity and nuclear localization, as well as with retention in the cells where it is produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	336	In this context, it is noteworthy that SHR is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the stele, where it is produced.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	337	 From there, SHR moves exactly one cell diameter, into the adjacent endodermis, where it is located entirely in the nucleus (Nakajima et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	338	 This observation is consistent with a model in which SHR gets trapped in the nuclei of the endodermis through interaction with a partner that causes translocation to the nucleus, similar to the AP3/PI interaction (McGonigle et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	339	Mechanisms of movement Our results are compatible with the view that LFY movement is driven by diffusion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	340	 However, it remains unclear whether the same conclusion can be drawn regarding the intercellular movement of other transcription factors.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Another well-studied example of a trafficking transcription factor is KN1 of maize (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	342	 As with LFY, KN1-GFP fusions are detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and in a punctate pattern associated with the cell wall (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	343	 In contrast to LFY, for which various deletions did not prevent movement, a simple mutation in the homeodomain and the potential NLS of KN1 abolished its movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Furthermore, experiments with tobacco have indicated the presence of a cellular component that is limiting for KN1 movement, and have suggested that the mode of KN1 trafficking may be related to the targeted movement of viral movement proteins (Kragler et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	345	 However, other results are consistent with KN1 moving in a non-targeted fashion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In bombardment assays, KN1-GFP moved considerably less well than a fusion of GFP to the movement protein of TVCV (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Furthermore, movement of KN1 expressed from the SCR promoter in the shoot apex of transgenic Arabidopsis plants was rather limited (Kim et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	348	, 2002), similar to that of NLS:2xGFP or GFP:LFY expressed from the ML1 promoter (this work).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Further studies in a nonheterologous system will be required to clarify the mechanisms behind KN1 movement.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	350	 A complex relationship between targeted and non-targeted movement is also indicated by a recent study, in which a dominant-negative form of the tobacco NON-CELL-AUTONOMOUS PATHWAY PROTEIN 1 (NtNCAPP1) was overexpressed.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	351	 In such transgenic plants, trafficking of viral movement protein, but not of KN1, was affected (Lee et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Interestingly, tobacco LFY protein appears more uniform in such transgenic plants, which also have phenotypes reminiscent of LFY overexpressing plants.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	353	 The causal relationship between these observations needs further investigation, but it will be interesting to combine the dominant-negative NtCAPP1 overexpressing plants with the tools presented here.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	354	It is also worth noting that the determinants underlying transcription factor movement may be species-dependent.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Like LFY, its Antirrhinum ortholog FLORICAULA (FLO) has non-cell-autonomous effects in mosaic studies (Carpenter and Coen, 1995).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	356	 In contrast to LFY, the extent to which FLO can rescue mutant flowers varies depending on the layer in which FLO is expressed (Hantke et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	357	 As FLO protein has not been examined in these mosaics, it is unknown whether the differential rescue ability is caused by differences in FLO movement, or is only a result of downstream effects, such as the documented abnormalities in target gene expression in the mosaics (Hantke et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Another example of interspecific differences is provided by DEF of Antirrhinum, which was found to move from the L2 to the L1 in a stage- and organ-dependent manner (Perbal et al.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	359	 However, the DEF ortholog AP3 of Arabidopsis does not move between layers (Jenik and Irish, 2001), which indicates that subtle differences in sequence, or interspecific differences in the translocation machinery, affect transcription factor movement, the latter being consistent with the interspecific differences that have been reported for GFP movement (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001).
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	360	 These observations highlight that care must be taken when extrapolating from one transcription factor assayed in a single species or single tissue.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	361	In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the transcription factor LFY moves in a non-targeted fashion.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	362	 We are proposing the testable hypothesis that movement is a default mechanism for many proteins in the Arabidopsis shoot apex, unless they are either efficiently targeted to specific subcellular locations or retained through formation of protein complexes.
0.15670726.12835390.html.plaintext.txt	363	 More case studies are needed to determine whether our results can indeed be generalized to include other proteins, other tissues and other species.

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Exogenous transfer RNAs (tRNAs) favor translation of bovine papillomavirus 1 wild-type (wt) L1 mRNA in in vitro translation systems (Zhou et al.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We, therefore, investigated whether papillomavirus (PV) wt L1 protein expression could be enhanced in eukaryotic cells following exogenous tRNA supplementation.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Cos1 cells, transfected with PV1 wt L1 genes, effectively transcribed the genes but did not translate them.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, L1 protein translation was demonstrated following co-transfection with the L1 gene and a gene expressing tRNASer(CGA).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Cell lines, stably transfected with a bovine papillomavirus 1 (BPV1) wt L1 expression construct, produced L1 protein after the transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene, but not following the transfection with basal vectors, suggesting that tRNASer(CGA) gene enhanced wt L1 translation as a result of endogenous tRNA alterations and phosphorylation of translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2 in the tRNASer(CGA) transfected L1 cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The tRNASer(CGA) gene expression significantly reduced translation of L1 proteins expressed from codon-modified (HB) PV L1 genes utilizing mammalian preferred codons, but had variable effects on translation of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) expressed from six serine GFP variants.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The changes of tRNA pools appear to match the codon composition of PV wt and HB L1 genes and serine GFP variants to regulate translation of their mRNAs.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings demonstrate for the first time in eukaryotic cells that translation of the target genes can be differentially influenced by the provision of a single tRNA expression construct.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Translation is a key facet of the central dogma of molecular biology (1), which uses the genetic information in mRNA to synthesize protein.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) play a central role in translation, acting as the carrier of the monomeric units of proteins, the amino acids and the growing polypeptide chains (2).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Both tRNA and mRNA eventually pair on the ribosome to determine which amino acid is inserted at a particular point in the nascent polypeptide chain.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To ensure protein synthesis, correct base pairing between the three bases of the codons on the mRNAs and those of the anticodons of the cognate aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs dictates the sequence of the polypeptide chain.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In addition, the cellular content of tRNA isoaccepting species is clearly a determinant of the rates and amounts of protein synthesis (3).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In unicellular organisms, a correlation between tRNA content constraint and gene expression level has been demonstrated using the concept of optimal codons (4).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A shortage of critical tRNAs could result in slowed elongation of the nascent peptide or premature termination of translation (5,6).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The tRNAs from uninfected cells can rescue the translation of global proteins in Autographa california nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected Ld652Y cells (7).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Stimulated expression of GTase with tRNAAGA and tRNAAGG resulted in a 5-fold increase in GTase production in Escherichia coli, in which codon usage is highly biased and the tRNAs specific to codons AGAarg and AGGarg are extremely rare (8).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Expression of a single tRNA gene has enhanced the expression of heterologous genes, especially for genes containing rare codons in bacterial expression systems (9,10).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The data support the argument that the variable copy number of individual isoacceptor tRNAs is a primary determinant of translation (11).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, it is not clear whether provision of a single tRNA gene expression can mediate the expression of target genes at either the transcriptional or translational levels in eukaryotic cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	26	The tRNA molecules and tRNA-like structures have been identified as crucial elements in the replication of a very diverse group of viruses including plant viruses (12,13) and mammalian retroviruses (14).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recently, a human tRNASer(CGA) gene has been cloned and expressed in mammalian cells (15,16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The cloned human tRNASer(CGA) gene containing 400 bp has previously been verified for its integrity and functionality (15,16), via its ability to act in reverse transcription of a retroviral vector harboring a complementary primer binding site sequence (16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The human tRNASer(CGA) molecule was originally identified via a screening of the human BOSC23 retroviral packaging cell line (17) for tRNA molecules functionable as primers for murine leukemia virus (MLV) replication (16).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	30	 But it is not clear whether this tRNASer(CGA) molecule could be functional for protein translation of MLV and other viruses.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	31	 More recently, tRNA-like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus has been reported to be a 3'-translational enhancer, which enhanced expression of a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene up to 25-fold (18).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Therefore, we are interested to investigate whether and how the expression of the human tRNASer(CGA) gene would affect the expression of wild-type (wt) and codon-modified (HB) papillomavirus (PV) L1 genes in cultured mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	33	Both wt and HB PV L1 genes were chosen as the target genes throughout the experiments; we initially considered the choice for three reasons.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	34	 First, PVs are exclusively epitheliotropic viruses.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The PV life cycle is tightly linked to epithelial cell differentiation.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Production of viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2) expressed from the late gene (L1 and L2) is restricted to the most terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the upper layers of the epithelium.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Expression of L1 and L2 proteins from wt PV L1 and L2 genes has not been observed in proliferating transfected keratinocytes (19) and other replicating mammalian cells (20).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, mRNAs encoding the capsid proteins can be detected in less-differentiated keratinocytes and other replicating mammalian cells, suggesting that the expression of the late genes is post-transcriptionally regulated (21).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	39	 When the L1 and L2 genes are cloned under cytomegalovirus (CMV) or simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters in continuously growing transformed cell lines in transient transfection assays, large amounts of PV L1 and L2 mRNAs are made, but no proteins can be detected (20).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Second, blockage to the translation of PV L1 mRNAs has been overcome by two means: point mutation (19) and codon modification (20,22 to 24).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Introduction of point mutations in the 5' end of the L1 gene which altered the RNA sequence without affecting the protein sequence resulted in the production of high levels of HPV 16 L1 mRNA and protein in HeLa cells (19).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Codon modification of the PV L1 and L2 genes utilizing mammalian preferred codons without changing the protein sequence can express L1 and L2 proteins in large amounts in replicating mammalian cells (20,22 to 24).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The argument proposed from the codon modification studies is that codon usage of the PV L1 and L2 genes may be a major determinant of PV capsid protein expression.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The observation we made recently that bovine papillomavirus (BPV) 1 can undergo its life cycle in BPV1 virus-infected Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25,26) supports this argument because codon usage of BPV1 genes more closely resembles that of yeast genes than that of the mammalian consensus (20).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The low expression efficiency of several viral proteins in HIV due to unfavorable codon usage has been reported by various groups (27 to 29).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Third, provision of exogenous tRNAs either from bovine liver or from yeast could greatly assist the translation of the BPV1 L1 gene and human PV 16 (HPV16) E7 translation in different in vitro translation systems (20,30).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These observations support the argument that codon usage of the mRNAs tends to be matched to the population of tRNAs in cells to regulate the translational efficiency.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Previous studies have indicated that codon usage in highly expressed genes is biased toward  optimal  codons corresponding to the tRNAs in the tissue or cell environments (31).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	49	 (31) reported that synthesis of a number of colicins is linked to the difference in tRNA availability for the various codons.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	50	 However, it is not clear whether and how the tRNA abundance in cells matches the corresponding codons in mRNAs of the target genes to regulate their expression at the translational levels in specific mammalian cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	51	In this report, we first examined whether the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene construct could enhance translation of wt PV L1 mRNAs in two replicating eukaryotic cell lines: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell system that closely mimics living cells (32) and Cos1 cells that effectively transcribe wt PV L1 genes but do not produce L1 proteins (20).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We then established two cell lines, CHO L1 and Cos1 L1, transfected with a wt BPV1 L1 expression construct, to determine whether the tRNASer(CGA) gene could assist translation of BPV1 L1 mRNA.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	53	 At the same time, we examined whether the supplement of exogenous tRNAs would enhance translation of wt PV L1 mRNAs in cell culture systems.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	54	 We then examined whether and how the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene affected the tRNA populations, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2, and expression of cellular proteins in the two L1 cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We further studied whether the tRNASer(CGA) gene affected the expression of the L1 proteins encoded by two HB PV L1 genes (BPV1 and HPV6b L1 genes) in which CGA was a rarely used codon in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Finally, we investigated whether and how the tRNASer(CGA) gene affected expression of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) expressed from hm gfp gene and six serine GFP variants, in which a leader sequence of six consecutive identical codons from one of the six serine codons (AGC, AGU, UCA, UCC, UCG and UCU) was introduced into the hm gfp gene downstream from the AUG codon in CHO cells.

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The PV wt L1 genes show a strong codon usage bias, amongst degenerately encoded amino acids, toward 18 codons mainly with T at the third position that are rarely used by mammalian genes (20,33).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	63	 We artificially modified BPV1 and HPV6b L1 genes, in which the L1 ORFs are substituted with codons preferentially used in the mammalian genome.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	64	 We made about 250 base substitutions in 250 codons rarely used in mammalian cells to produce unmodified L1 proteins encoded from the L1 ORFs with consensus codon usage using the strategy previously reported (20).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	65	 All the wt and codon-modified PV L1 sequences were sequenced and found to be error free; they were then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 containing SV40 ori (Invitrogen, Australia), giving four expression plasmids pCDNA3BPV1 L1, pCDNA3BPV1 HB L1, pCDNA3HPV6b L1 and pCDNA3HPV6b HB L1.

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	68	 All the serine GFP variant and hm gfp cDNAs were produced from hm gfp by PCR using two flanking primers as described previously (35) and ligated into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of the pCDNA3 vector to construct seven GFP plasmids: hm gfp, AGC GFP, AGU GFP, UCA GFP, UCC GFP, UCG GFP and UCU GFP.

0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The results cannot confirm our and other previous observations that supplementation of exogenous tRNAs enhanced the translation of PV L1 and E7 genes in in vitro translation systems (20,30), but they are consistent with the studies carried out by the other researchers that exogenous tRNAs have no effect on protein synthesis in permeabilized cells (32,38).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The major reason is different translation machinery used in the in vitro translation systems and cell culture systems.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Using CHO cell system, previous work has provided strong evidence that the translation apparatus is highly organized in cultured cells (32).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Exogenous tRNAs cannot enter the translation machinery in cultured cells despite the fact that exogenous tRNA can rapidly distribute throughout the cells and can be aminoacylated by minor portion of the cellular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in permeabilized cells (38).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Moreover, exogenous aminoacyl-tRNA in permeable cells is not sequestered and protected against RNase treatment, in contrast to endogenous tRNA molecules (39), because during translation endogenous tRNAs are never in a state in which they can mix with and be competed against by exogenous tRNA molecules (38).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	292	 All of the above observations may explain why exogenous tRNAs did not play a role in enhancing the translation of PV L1 mRNA in both CHO and Cos1 cells examined in the present study if they were efficiently taken up by the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	293	 It is also possible that exogenous tRNAs were not taken up by the cells so no functional roles could be identified.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	294	Previous studies have indicated that changes of physiological factors resulted in alteration in the populations of specific or total tRNAs in the mammalian tissues or cells (40 to 44).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	295	 For example, ovariectomy resulted in alterations in the population of uterine serine tRNA (40).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Due to carcinogenesis, cellular tRNA distribution was shifted in the tRNA population with an increased level of initiator tRNAMet in the malignant tissues (44).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Selenium, an essential trace element that functions in proteins (selenocysteine, Sec) critical for a variety of cellular processes, influences the level of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec population and the distribution of the Sec tRNA[ser]sec isoacceptors in both mammalian cells grown in culture (45) and mammalian tissues (46) and the turnover of Sec tRNA[ser]sec in CHO cells (43).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The present data indicate further that the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene increased not only the relative levels of the tRNASer(CGA) and the initiator tRNAMet but also probably resulted in new tRNA species produced in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Consequently, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene altered the gel profiles of the total tRNAs in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Our results are in agreement with previous studies (47 to 52) in that genes for expressing tRNA species introduced into cells change tRNA contents in the targeted cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Thus, all the observations suggest that mammalian cells may have a sensitive mechanism to sense and respond to both changes in physiological factors and introduction of foreign tRNA genes, by altering their tRNA populations.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	302	Here, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was identified to enhance the expression of L1 proteins encoded by the PV wt L1 genes and of GFPs encoded by two (UCG and AGU) serine variants in two cell lines examined.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Previously, there have been examples in which synthesis of a specialized protein is associated with expression of a single tRNA gene due to modification of the tRNA population in different expression systems (9,10).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was then found to increases the synthesis of some cellular proteins in the present study.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	305	 As a result, expression of 5 to 10% of total cellular proteins was increased in the L1 cells following transfection of the tRNASer(CGA) gene when compared to the control L1 cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Our results support previous studies that tRNAs, even a single tRNA, affect protein expression encoded by heterologous genes in different expression systems (9,10,20,30,40,41).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	307	 For example, tRNAs from oviducts of estrogen-stimulated chicks or from oviducts of laying hens produced an enhanced stimulation of ovalbumin synthesis in vitro (40).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The use of tRNA (AGA/AGG) increased human interferon HUIFN-a2 and HCV core protein expression (9,10), but barely affected the human IFN-8 expression in an E.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	309	 However, expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene reduced expression of L1 proteins encoded by the PV HB L1 genes and of GFP encoded by UCA serine variant and of some cellular proteins.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The result was consistent with a few other studies.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	311	 A tRNASer(UCN) gene flanked with the deafness-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) T7445C mutation at the 3' end causes an average reduction of 70% in the levels of the tested proteins and a decrease of 45% in protein synthesis rate in the cell lines analyzed (53).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Recently, Akama and Beier (54) reported that co-transfection of Arabidopsis hypocotyls with amber suppressor tRNASer(CGA) gene and the GUS reporter gene resulted in 10% of the GUS activity found in the same tissue transformed solely with the GUS gene.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Therefore, we can speculate that contents and modifications of the endogenous tRNAs have effects on the expression of a large number of both foreign and host genes through tRNA function in translation in mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that the host cell tRNAs can affect the synthesis of gene products quantitatively and qualitatively in translating heterologous genes (55,56).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	315	The most interesting finding in the present study is that the tRNASer(CGA) gene had variable effects on expression of the PV wt and HB L1 genes and of hm gfp gene and serine GFP variants at protein translational levels in the two cell lines examined.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Previous studies have reported that the expression of the PV capsid genes (L1 and L2) is controlled by several means: the late viral promoters depend on the differentiation status of the cells, polyadenylation signals terminate transcription before reaching the late regions (57 to 60) and mRNAs encoding the capsid proteins contain inhibitory elements that prevent nuclear export or destabilize the message (19,61 to 66).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	317	 However, none of these studies produced the PV L1 and L2 proteins expressed from the wt L1 and L2 genes in replicating mammalian cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	318	 In contrast, previous findings in our laboratory have indicated that a strong bias in codon usage is apparent between the papillomavirus and its host, which blocks BPV1 capsid genes from expressing their proteins in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,33).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	319	 On the basis of the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNA contents regulates the gene expression at the protein levels (20), the limitation of PV capsid protein expression has been overcome by modifying the codon usage of these genes toward mammalian  consensus  without changing the protein sequence, demonstrating that codon usage is one of the determinants of the rate of HPV gene expression in non-differentiated mammalian cells (20,22 to 24,67).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	320	 In the present study, we take a different approach to test the hypothesis that the match between codon usage and tRNAs regulate PV L1 genes to express their proteins.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	321	 We expressed a tRNASer(CGA) gene in the two non-differentiated cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in alterations in tRNA patterns in the two cell lines examined, which enhanced translation of two PV wt L1 mRNAs that contain large numbers of the codons rarely used by mammalian genes (20,33).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Meanwhile, the enhanced expression of the serine UCG GFP variant was probably corresponding to the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene according to a previous statement that correct translation of the UCG codon depends on the tRNASer(CGA) molecule (68).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Although it has been reported that tRNA1Ser(G34) with the anticodon GGA can recognize not only UCC and UCU codons but also UCA and UCG codons (69), but the enhanced expression of the serine AGU GFP variant by the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene is presently not understood.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Moreover, we observed that expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene resulted in a dramatic reduction in the translation of PV HB L1 and UCA serine GFP variant mRNAs in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Thus, the phenomena observed in the present study may be well explained by two previous statements by Del Tito et al.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	327	 These statements have described how the tRNAs in cells are related to the gene expression at translation levels: (i) if the level of certain tRNAs was low, then one would predict translational difficulties in decoding mRNA species containing large numbers of the rare codons (55) and (ii) the cellular content of tRNA species often correlates positively with the codon bias of mRNAs for the major homologous protein products (70).
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Taken together with these statements (55) and our previous studies (20), current data strengthen support for the hypothesis that codon usage matches tRNAs to regulate expression of the target genes in both non-differentiated and differentiated epithelium.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	329	Recently, Walsh and Mohr (71) provided the first evidence that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor elF4E by the elF4E kinase mnk-1 is crucial for viral protein synthesis and replication of the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in quiescent cells.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Consistent with their report, phosphorylation of the two translation initiation factors elF4E and elF2 induced by the tRNASer(CGA) gene appears to be required for the translation of the PV wt L1 mRNAs in the two cell lines examined in the present study.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	331	 In contrast to this expectation, however, the phosphorylation of elF4E and elF2 may have selective effects, even reducing the translation of the PV HB L1 and serine UCA GFP mRNAs.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Thus, the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene was able to regulate the phosphorylation levels of both elF4E and elF2, suggesting that another possible mechanism is involved by which the PV L1 genes and serine GFP variants may differentially regulate cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	333	Based on our observations, we can conclude that alterations in tRNAs and phosphorylation of elF4E and elF2 caused by the expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene are important in modulating expression of the PV L1 genes with different codon usage and serine GFP variants at protein translational levels in the two cell lines.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	334	 However, tRNAs must associate with their cognate aaRSs that catalyze the attachment of a particular amino acid to the 3' end of an appropriate tRNAs containing the anticodon corresponding to that amino acid to generate aminoacyl-tRNAs necessary for protein synthesis.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	335	 But, it is not clear whether the expression and activities of any aaRSs is affected by the tRNASer(CGA) gene.
0.19826251.15319446.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Detailed studies are therefore necessary to examine how expression of the tRNASer(CGA) gene affects the other components of the protein-synthesizing machinery, including the aaRSs and the elongator factors in the two cell lines.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These experiments suggest a central role for this short sequence in DNA binding, interacting with the cell surface of target cells and facilitating the nuclear import of complexes owing to the presence of an NLS.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In order to verify the role of this positively charged sequence, we investigated the possibility of using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 14 C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L1 protein in DNA transfection experiments.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Retardation was not observed when using the positively charged SV40 large T NLS peptide (PPKKKRKVA) at the same charge ratios.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We further hypothesized that the formation of such complexes might prevent DNA degradation by nuclease.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	101	 L1 peptide/pCMV- DNA complexes were therefore treated for 1 h at 37  degrees C with Benzonase.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Moreover, pre-incubation of COS-7 cells with HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide induced 60 % inhibition of the gene transfer obtained with HPV-31 pseudovirions, compared with an absence of inhibition (0 %) observed after pre-incubation with the SV40 large T NLS peptide.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This result suggests that the peptide binds to the HPV-31 cell-surface receptor.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	113	 An alternative explanation could be that the excess of peptide binds to the DNA associated with the VLPs, resulting in a decrease in gene transfer due to the lower capacity of the peptide to transfer the gene compared with that obtained with the VLPs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In order to rule out this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were pre-incubated with HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide followed by the addition of plasmid DNA to the cell culture medium.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The absence of gene transfer (not shown) thus supports the hypothesis that the peptide binds to the cell receptor of HPV-31.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Our findings suggest that this could be due to the presence of a strong DNA-binding sequence at the C terminus of the protein.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This raises the question of which DNA-binding sequence detected within the L1 and L2 proteins interacts with the PES identified on the BPV-1 genome between nucleotides 1506 and 1625 (Zhao et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This PES was also recognized by HPV-6b VLPs despite the phylogenic distance between these two papillomavirus types.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	167	 It has been shown that the presence of L2 in HPV VLPs dramatically increase their gene transfer efficiency (Roden et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	168	, 1998) and that packaging with BPV-1 L1+L2 VLPs is increased in the presence of a papillomavirus DNA sequence (Zhao et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	169	, 1999), suggesting that specific DNA binding to L2 is necessary to obtain efficient packaging.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	170	 We therefore investigated gene transfer into COS-7 cells, using L1 and L2 synthetic peptides complexed with a pCMV- plasmid and a pPES-CMV- plasmid (El Mehdaoui et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	171	No transfection was observed with HPV-16 L1 Cta and HPV-31 L1 Ctb peptides, whichever plasmid was used.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, when using the two HPV-16 L2 peptides or the HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-31 L1 Cta and HPV-45 L1 Cta peptides, a two- to threefold significant increase in the level of gene transfer was observed (Table 2) when the plasmid contained the BPV PES, in comparison with the levels obtained with the pCMV- plasmid (P=10-5, 10-2,  < 10-5, 7x10-5and 2x10-4, respectively).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	173	 No increase in gene transfer was observed when using Lipofectamine and pCMV-PES- (438 plus or minus 3 cells per well) compared with the use of pCMV- (470 plus or minus 2 cells per well).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This suggested that the increase observed in gene transfer with L1 or L2 peptides is not due to differences in gene transfer efficiency of the two plasmids used, nor to a post-entry effect of PES on luciferase expression.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	177	  To confirm the higher binding of positively charged sequences of L1 and L2 proteins with PES sequences compared with random DNA as suggested by transfection experiments, binding of the HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-16 L2 Ct and SV40 large T peptides to probes containing PES or not was also investigated by ELISA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Absence of DNA binding with PES-positive and PES-negative DNA sequences was observed for the SV40 Large T peptide (A=0 007 plus or minus 0 001 and 0 014 plus or minus 0 007, respectively).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Increased DNA-binding activity to DNA sequences containing the PES sequence of BPV1 was observed for both the HPV 16 L1 Ctb peptide (0 390 plus or minus 0 040 versus 0 030 plus or minus 0 020) and the HPV 16 L2 Ct peptide (0 440 plus or minus 0 040 versus 0 030 plus or minus 0 020).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	180	These findings indicated that gene transfer was enhanced in the presence of the BPV PES with all peptides that had the capacity to bind to DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This confirmed that the PES is not papillomavirus type-specific and suggested that both L1 and L2 proteins recognized BPV PES.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In addition, the results suggested that the very low level of gene transfer observed with HPV-16 L1 Cta and HPV-31 L1 Ctb peptides in the presence of pCMV-Luc plasmid was not a consequence of the fact that these peptides have a higher affinity for papillomavirus DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	183	Binding of positively charged peptides derived from HPV L1 or L2 proteins to heparin and cell GAGs As L1 and L2 positively charged sequences are able to transfer genes, it could be hypothesized that such peptides bind to DNA and to cells and that the NLS activity of such peptides sends the plasmid DNA to the nucleus where the reporter gene is expressed.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	184	 GAGs have been proposed as cell receptors for HPVs (Joyce et al.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This sequence was included in the HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	187	The interaction between peptides and heparin was tested using a competition assay measuring the binding of HPV-31 VLPs to heparin-coated plates.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The results were expressed as percentage inhibition of HPV-31 VLP binding to heparin.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Inhibition greater than 50 % was considered to indicate binding of the peptide to heparin.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	190	 To rule out the hypothesis that these findings were due to binding between peptides and VLPs, the interaction between HPV-31 VLPs and HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-31 L1 Cta, HPV-45 L1 Ctb and HPV16 E4 Ag peptides was investigated by ELISA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	191	 No binding (A < 0 050) of HPV-31 VLPs to any of the peptides investigated was observed.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These results indicated that all peptides inhibited binding of VLPs to heparin with the exception of HPV-16 E4 Ag, HPV-16 L1 Cta, HPV-31 L1 Ctb and HPV-58 L1 Ctb (Table 1).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It should be noted that peptides that did not deliver genes into cells did not bind to heparin, nor did they bind efficiently to DNA.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In addition, the absence of binding of HPV-16 L19 VLPs to heparin (data not shown) confirmed and extended the results of Joyce et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (1999) with HPV-11, suggesting that binding to heparin is mediated by the L1 protein 15 C-terminal amino acids.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	196	To test whether GAGs could competitively inhibit gene delivery, COS-7 cells were transfected with all the DNA/peptide complexes that transferred genes in the presence of heparin.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Following exposure to DNA/peptide complexes and heparin, cells were washed, incubated in fresh culture medium and assayed for luciferase expression 48 h later.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	201	 For this purpose, COS-7 cells were grown in the presence of sodium chlorate for 12 h and then transfected with HPV-16 L1 Ctb, HPV-33 L1 Ctb, HPV-45 L1 Ctb and L2 N- and C-terminal peptides.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Luciferase gene expression was inhibited by pretreatment with sodium chlorate in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Gene transfer was dramatically decreased compared with untreated cells, with a decrease of 69 % for HPV-16 L1 Ctb peptide and 70 % for HPV-45 L1 Ctb (Fig.

0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	209	  The results obtained are in agreement with those of gene transfer using HPV-16 L19 VLPs made of L1 protein lacking the last nine amino acids (Touze et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	210	, 2000), indicating that these amino acids are essential for DNA binding and gene transfer.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These findings are in agreement with those of Giroglou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	212	 (2001) indicating that HPV-33 VLPs made of L1 protein lacking the last seven amino acids still bind to target cells since we identified a second positively charged sequence able to bind heparan sulfate at positions 472 to 481 of the C terminus of HPV-33 L1 protein.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, they are not in agreement with the fact that HPV-33 VLPs made of L1 protein lacking the 22 last amino acids still bind to target cells, since this deletion partially deletes the second DNA- and heparin-binding sequence.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	214	 However, it should be noted that the VLPs used by Giroglou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	215	 (2001) were composed of L1 and L2 proteins and that binding to heparin could be due to the presence of the two DNA- and heparin-binding sequences identified at the N and C termini of L2.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	216	Structural data available concerning L1 protein (Chen et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	217	, 2000) and immunological and DNA-binding data concerning L2 protein (Zhou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	218	, 2002) suggest that the peptides tested in this study are inside the virions, where they would be expected to be unavailable for heparin and cell GAG binding.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, gene transfer experiments using VLPs have indicated that VLP binding to DNA, to cells and to heparin is linked to the last C-terminal amino acids of the L1 protein (Joyce et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	220	, 2000), suggesting its presence at the surface of the VLPs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The absence of heparin binding observed for HPV-16 L19 VLPs clearly suggests the involvement of this sequence in cell binding through its binding to GAGs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	222	The role of the positively charged termini of the L2 protein in viral encapsidation has been fully established (Zhou et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The results of heparin binding obtained with L2 positively charged peptides raise the possibility that these sequences could also be involved in VLP and virion binding to the cell GAGs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	224	 L1+L2 VLPs lacking either the N or C terminus of the L2 protein have been shown by immunoflurescence studies to bind to cells in the same way as wild-type VLPs (Roden et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	225	, 2001), suggesting that these sequences do not play a central role in binding to cells.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, in the absence of data obtained with pseudovirions composed of L1 C-terminal mutants and L2 proteins (both wild-type and N-terminal mutants), it is difficult to conclude whether N-terminal positively charged sequences of the L2 protein are present on the virion surface and play a role in its binding to the cell or not.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	227	In conclusion, using synthetic peptides we have confirmed that the DNA binding of the HPV-16 L1 protein is due to the last C-terminal amino acids.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We also confirmed the binding properties of N- and C-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 L2 protein.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In addition, we determined that a second positively charged sequence located upstream from the previous L1 sequence is able to bind DNA for some HPV types (HPV-33 and -45), but not, or not significantly, for other types (HPV-16, -31 and -58).
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The interaction between these DNA-binding peptides and DNA induced protection from DNase degradation and was sufficient to obtain gene transfer in COS-7 cells.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, the level of gene transfer with a peptide was around 150 times less efficient than that observed with the corresponding sequence within the VLPs.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	232	 It was also shown that gene transfer is mediated by binding of DNA/peptide complexes to heparan sulfate receptors, as for VLPs, confirming that positively charged DNA complexes can enter cells after binding to membrane-associated sulfated proteoglycans (Mislick  and  Baldeschweiler, 1996; Mounkes et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In addition, our findings are in agreement with reports that the inclusion of L2 protein in the constitution of HPV VLPs increases their gene transfer capacity (Roden et al.
0.25950646.12533712.html.plaintext.txt	234	, 2001) and thus suggests that L2 participates in DNA encapsidation and could play a role in binding to cells.

0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	199	   Discussion Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   Several bacteria and viruses have been shown to subvert the cytoskeleton for their intracellular trafficking (Dramsi and Cossart, 1998; Frischknecht and Way, 2001; Ploubidou and Way, 2001; Sodeik, 2000).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, despite a growing body of knowledge accumulating in this field, how retroviruses reach the nucleus of the newly infected cell is still poorly understood.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	201	 To shed a new light on this stage of viral replication, we have studied the route taken by HFV, an animal retrovirus, during the early steps of infection.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	202	By EM, we show here that incoming HFV proteins concentrate in the pericentrosomal region as free and structured capsids close to MTs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	203	 More viral capsids surround the MTOC than expected from the multiplicity of infection used.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Indeed, most extracellular retroviral particles produced during an infection harbor a defective genome and are therefore unable to transactivate the viral LTR of GFP-indicator cells (Tobaly-Tapiero et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In the case of HIV-1, it has been reported that infectivity to particle ratio is as low as 1 in 60,000 (Kimpton and Emerman, 1992; Piatak et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	206	, 1993), whereas a more recent study softened this conclusion by showing a ratio up to 1 infectious particle in 10 (Andreadis et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Furthermore, we demonstrate that the determinants required to reach the pericentrosomal area are harbored by the scaffold component of viral capsids, the structural Gag protein, because this protein alone targets the centrosome in transfected cells in the absence of other viral partners.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	208	Because the vimentin network is not affected in Gag-transfected cells, accumulation of Gag around the MTOC does not trigger the formation of an aggresome.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, similar to the formation of this inclusion body (Garcia-Mata et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	210	, 1999), Gag transport towards the MTOC involves the retrograde dynein-dynactin motor, because it is prevented by overproduction of CC1, the central coiled-coil domain of p150Glued, reported to disrupt the function of this retrograde motor.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Other viruses have been shown to use the MT network for their intracellular transport.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	212	 For instance, adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and HSV, two nuclear replicative DNA viruses entering the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and direct membrane fusion respectively, are transported as naked capsids towards the nucleus via the MT network (Sodeik et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	213	 For ASFV and rabies viruses, two other viruses that use the MT network to move within the infected cell, an interaction with LC8 forms a molecular basis of this trafficking (Alonso et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The interaction between LC8 and HFV Gag described here could play such a role in the case of FVs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	215	LC8 was first identified as an integral component of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii outer dynein arm (Pfister et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	216	, 1982; Piperno and Luck, 1979).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Since then, this evolutionarily conserved molecule has been shown to interact with many cellular complexes, such as the nitric oxide synthase (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996) and myosin V (Goode et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	218	, 2000), an actin-based motor mainly located at the plasma membrane that shuttles between the cell periphery and the MTOC along the MT network (Espreafico et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	219	 LC8 is encoded by at least two genes in humans (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	220	, 2000), leading to the synthesis of dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) and dynein light chain 1 (DLC1), the isoform used in our work.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Interestingly, myosin V has been shown to interact with DLC2 but not with DLC1 (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Thus, migration of HFV capsids towards the centrosome on the microtubule network probably involves an interaction with dynein LC8 (DLC1) rather than myosin V LC8 (DLC2).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In that sense, HFV efficiently targets the centrosomal region and replicates in myosin-V-deficient melanoma S91-6 cells (E.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	224	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that HFV Gag also interacts with DLC2 as a component of myosin V, favoring its trafficking on actin beneath the plasma membrane devoid of microtubules.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Therefore, interaction between incoming FV capsids and the multifunctional LC8 could provide a bridge to shuttle between an actin-based motor beneath the plasma membrane and the MT network within the cytoplasm.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Remarkably, a similar MT- and dynein-dependent trafficking towards the centrosome was recently described for incoming HIV-1, although the viral and cellular protagonists involved in this retrograde transport were not determined (McDonald et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Nevertheless, these observations suggest that distinct classes of retroviruses might tether the dynein-dynactin complex motor on the MT network during the early stage of infection to reach the nucleus, opening new perspectives in the development of anti-retroviral drugs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	228	Analysis of the subcellular distribution of Gag deletion mutants reveals that the GR boxes as well as the determinants involved in capsid assembly (the Gag-Gag interaction domain and the CTRS) are not required to target the centrosome, whereas amino acids 150-180 are necessary to reach this organelle.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	229	 This region does not harbor any obvious similarities with the two previously described LC8-interacting motifs, (K/R)XTQT and GIQVD (Lo et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	230	, 2001), but a coiled-coil motif conserved in all primate foamy viruses (Tobaly-Tapiero et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	231	, 2001) seems to be involved in centriolar targeting of Gag.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	232	 In that sense, a single point mutation (L171G) in the Gag ORF, leading to the disruption of the coiled-coil motif, abolishes MTOC targeting of the corresponding GFP-Gag fusion and renders a full-length viral clone non-infectious.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Indeed, whereas Gag assembly and virus release are not affected by this helix-breaking point mutation, productive infection of naive cells is dramatically reduced.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Because this mutation was shown to prevent Gag/LC8 interaction, tethering of the dynein retrograde motor following its entry into the cytoplasm might be impaired, a hypothesis that we are currently exploring.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The L171G point mutation does not totally abolish infectivity, suggesting that other trafficking pathways might be used by FVs to reach the center of the cell.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In that sense, intracellular trafficking involving the actin cytoskeleton might account for this observation, an alternative route already put forward for HIV-1 (McDonald et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	237	, 2002) and previously suggested for FVs because Gag was also shown to interact with actin (Giron et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	238	HFV Gag is not the unique partner of LC8 lacking the two characterized LC8-interacting motifs.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Interestingly, all these proteins harbor an -helical coiled-coil in the domain identified as the LC8-binding region.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For example, the LC8-interacting domain of myosin V is predicted to fold into an amphiphilic helix (Naisbitt et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	241	, 2000) and, similarly, the signal response domain of IB, which was shown to interact with LC8 (Crepieux et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	242	, 1997), folds into a coiled coil as revealed by the COILS program (data not shown).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Such a hypothesis might also apply to the neuronal form of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (Benashski et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Given that LC8 harbors a similar amphiphilic helix triggering its multimerization (Benashski et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	245	, 1997), interactions between LC8 and myosin V, IB, nNOS and HFV Gag might occur via such specific protein motif interface, constituting a new mode of contact with LC8.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	246	One remaining issue is how the viral genome, wrapped by Gag molecules, is imported into the nucleus.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Interestingly, the dynein-dynactin complex has recently been shown to associate with the nuclear envelope, facilitating the remodeling of this physical frontier (Busson et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Therefore, interaction of Gag with the dynein-dynactin complex could not only drive incoming viral capsids towards the centrosome but also be involved in their subsequent targeting to the nuclear envelope.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Yet, HFV capsids were never detected within the nucleus, nor close to nuclear pores, even later during the replication cycle [here and Fischer et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	250	, 1998)], whereas unassembled Gag proteins and the viral genome are detected in the nucleus early after infection (Saib et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	251	, 1997; Schliephake and Rethwilm, 1994).
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Therefore, in contrast to Ad2 or HSV, those capsids dock to the nuclear pore triggering nuclear translocation of the viral genome (Greber et al.
0.1763323.12857789.html.plaintext.txt	253	, 2001), nuclear import of HFV Gag and genome must be accompanied by disassembly or significant deformation of the core particle at the MTOC.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	7	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Interaction between the E2 protein and E1 helicase of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is essential for the initiation of viral DNA replication.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We recently described a series of small molecules that bind to the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of HPV type 11 E2 and inhibits its interaction with E1 in vitro and in cellular assays.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we report the crystal structures of both the HPV11 TAD and of a complex between this domain and an inhibitor, at 2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domain of HPV16.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Inhibitor binding caused no significant alteration of the protein backbone, but movements of several amino acid side chains at the binding site, in particular those of Tyr-19, His-32, Leu-94, and Glu-100, resulted in the formation of a deep hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the indandione moiety of the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Mutational analysis provides functional evidence for specific interactions between Tyr-19 and E1 and between His-32 and the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A second inhibitor molecule is also present at the binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although evidence is presented that this second molecule makes only weak interactions with the protein and is likely an artifact of crystallization, its presence defines additional regions of the binding pocket that could be exploited to design more potent inhibitors.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human papillomaviruses (HPVs)1 are the etiological agents of malignant and benign lesions of the differentiating squamous or mucosal epithelium, notably of cervical cancer.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Approximately 25 HPV types replicate in mucosal tissues of the anogenital tract.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HPV16, -18, and -31 are the most prevalent "high-risk" types found in pre-cancerous or malignant lesions of the cervix.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	18	 HPV6 and -11 are the most common "low-risk" types, which cause benign genital warts (condyloma acuminata), a less serious condition but one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (1).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Currently, no specific antivirals are available for the treatment of HPV infections.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	20	The small circular double-stranded DNA genome of papillomavirus is actively maintained as a multicopy episome in the nucleus of infected epithelial cells.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This process is dependent on replication of the viral genome by the viral E1 and E2 proteins, in conjunction with the host DNA replication machinery.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	22	 E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has a number of functions in the viral lifecycle.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition to its role in the initiation of viral DNA replication, E2 is involved in regulating the transcription of viral genes (2-7), and in the segregation of the viral genome during cell division (8, 9).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As a replication initiation factor, E2 binds with high affinity to specific sites located within the viral origin (ori) to help recruit it to the E1 helicase (10-13).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Formation of a ternary complex between E1, E2, and the origin relies not only on the interaction of E1 and E2 with specific DNA sequences at the origin but is also critically dependent on a direct interaction between these two proteins (14-18).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	26	The 40-kDa E2 protein exists in solution as a dimer and consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of 200 residues, a C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain of 100 residues, and a connecting "hinge" region of 70 amino acids (19).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The N-terminal TAD is the region of E2 that binds to E1 (14, 15, 18).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	28	Crystal structures have been reported for the TAD of HPV16 (amino acids 1-201) (20) and for a truncated TAD of HPV18 (amino acids 66-215) lacking two N-terminal -helices (21).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The HPV16 and -18 TADs share 45% sequence identity (see Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	30	 1) and have a very similar L-shaped structure composed of a three-helix bundle, partly missing in the structure of the truncated HPV18 TAD, followed by an antiparallel -sheet.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	40	  We recently described a series of small molecules that antagonize the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction by binding reversibly to the E2 TAD (22, 23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This class of inhibitors, termed "indandiones" because they feature an indandione system spirofused onto a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring, blocks assembly of the HPV11 E1-E2-ori ternary complex at submicromolar concentrations in vitro and abrogates viral DNA replication in a transient transfection assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	42	 To our knowledge, these are the only small molecule inhibitors of HPV DNA replication with cellular activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	43	Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the HPV11 TAD and that of a TAD-indandione inhibitor complex.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The HPV11 TAD structure is very similar to that of the analogous domains of HPV16 and -18.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Inhibitor binding does not significantly affect the protein backbone but results in the formation of a deep pocket that makes several well defined interactions with the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Residues that have previously been implicated in binding E1 or the indandione inhibitors, including Gln-12 (24), Glu-39 (25-27), and Glu-100 (23) are in or near this pocket.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Thin green lines indicate hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor carboxylate and main chain amide nitrogens of residues 99 and 100.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	219	  Because we had demonstrated that the TAD and inhibitor 1 form a 1:1 complex in solution, we were surprised to find two molecules of inhibitor bound per protein monomer (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	220	 We believe that the molecule referred to below as inhibitor A is the one that binds tightly in biological assays (see below).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In contrast, inhibitor B appears to interact only weakly with a secondary binding pocket, formed not only by the TAD protein alone, but also in part by one surface of inhibitor A, as well as by residues from an adjacent protein monomer in the crystal lattice.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In fact, inhibitor B has approximately equal surface area in contact with each of the two TAD molecules, as well as with inhibitor A (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The close contact between the two inhibitor molecules may distort the observed interaction between the TAD and the dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor A (see below).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The TAD-TAD interface that incorporates inhibitor B is distinct from that in the apo structure, and in fact does not result in formation of a dimer, but rather an infinite array (along the 41 screw axis of the crystal), which is unlikely to exist in solution except at very high protein and inhibitor concentrations.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	225	To further demonstrate that the region of the TAD near inhibitor A constitutes a better binding pocket than does the one near B, a computational analysis of the protein surface was performed using the Site Finder application within the MOE software package (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This program uses an shape-based algorithm (44) to identify concave regions on the protein surface.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Furthermore, it evaluates whether these cavities have an appropriate composition of hydrophobic and hydrophilic atoms, as hydrophilic cavities are likely to be highly solvated and thus interact only weakly with organic molecules in aqueous solution.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The TAD surface was evaluated after removal of the two inhibitors, and residues that comprised the best small molecule-binding pocket are highlighted in Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Inhibitor A makes a number of close contacts with these highlighted residues, as described below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Inhibitor B is located on the periphery of this pocket and does not make any well defined hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The dichlorophenyl ring of inhibitor B is 4 A from the nearest pocket atoms; other portions of the molecule are further from the protein surface (indandione moiety) or make closest contact with non-pocket atoms (thiadiazoylphenyl moiety).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	232	In a separate computational study, binding energies for each inhibitor molecule to the TAD (in the absence of the other) were predicted using three different empirical protein-binding scoring functions (Table III).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	233	 As expected, results significantly favored binding of inhibitor A relative to B, with predicted binding energies 2-fold higher for inhibitor A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Taken together, these different methods suggest that inhibitor A is solely responsible for inhibition at the low concentrations used in biological assays and that the presence of inhibitor B might be an artifact of crystallization.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This suggestion is further supported by the mutational analysis of the inhibitor binding pocket, presented below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Although an artifact, it is possible that the fortuitous presence of this second molecule aided in crystallization of the complex.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	239	 For PMF (35) and PLP (36), a lower (more negative) score indicates better affinity, whereas for LUDI (37) a higher score predicts better affinity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For each program, scores are proportional to predicted binding energies.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, binding of this inhibitor induces significant movement of several amino acid side chains.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The indandione moiety of the inhibitor is buried in a pocket that is not present in the apo structure, but results from rotations of the side chains of Tyr-19 (1, 85 degrees ; 2, 40 degrees ) and His-32 (2, 90 degrees ) (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In the apo structure, the aromatic rings of His-32 and Trp-33 form a T-shaped edge-to-face structure, with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-19 close enough to form a hydrogen bond with the -nitrogen of His-32.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	246	 In the complex structure, this interaction is lost and the rings of His-32 and Trp-33 become parallel to each other.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Two other side chains, Leu-94 and Glu-100, also adjust their conformations to accommodate the inhibitor (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Together, these changes in side chain conformation result in the formation of the observed binding pocket (Fig.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	253	  The new positions of Tyr-19 and His-32 not only open up the pocket, but also allow the indandione moiety of the inhibitor to become a middle layer of a three-tier -stacking interaction between His-32 and Trp-33.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Additional Van der Waals contacts from the Leu-94 side chain result in a highly complementary shape to the deepest part of the pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Two other important interactions are made with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Tyr-99 and Glu-100; the distance (2.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	257	Remaining contacts of inhibitor A with the pocket are less well defined hydrophobic interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The dichlorophenyl ring lies in a wider but shallower portion of the pocket without making obvious specific interactions.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Although it has been found in previous studies (22) that both chlorine atoms contribute significantly to binding, neither atom is very close to the protein; the closest one being 4 A from the Tyr-19 side chain.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The observed position of the dichlorophenyl ring may be due in part to distortions induced by crystal packing or the presence of the second inhibitor molecule, as discussed above.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The thiadiazolylphenyl group lies along the protein surface outside of the pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Notably, the phenyl-thiadiazole bond is close to the side chain of Met-101.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This finding is consistent with recent photoaffinity labeling experiments2 in which the carbon atom para to the amide bond of an analogue was found to be covalently linked to the terminal carbon of Met-101 (see Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	264	Mutational Analysis of the Inhibitor Binding Pocket Several residues in or near the inhibitor binding pocket were mutated to examine the roles of specific side chains in binding the indandione, as well as gain insight into the possible overlap between the E1- and inhibitor-binding sites.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Most residues were mutated to Ala, but a few residues were replaced by amino acids found in other HPV types: His-32 was changed to Tyr as found in HPV16 E2, whereas Ile-30, Met-31, and Ile-36 were changed to Val, Leu, and Met, respectively, as found in HPV6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	266	 These last three residues are the only ones in the vicinity of inhibitor A that are different between HPV11 and -6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Also included in this study was the amino acid substitution I73A that is located on the opposite face of the protein and was previously shown to specifically affect the transactivation activity of E2 rather than its replication or E1 binding activity (25).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Each mutant protein was produced by in vitro translation and tested in our previously described E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using radiolabeled origin DNA (Table IV).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The ability of each protein to interact with E1 was scored qualitatively, because we did not control for variations in the level of protein produced in the in vitro transcription-translation reaction and, in any case, could not assess the proper folding or stability of the proteins.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Most mutant proteins retained at least some ability to productively interact with E1 at the origin.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	273	 A signal of 3100 cpm and signal: background (S:B) ratio = 21 was observed in assays performed with wild type E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	274	 For mutant E2 proteins, E1-E2-ori complex formation was scored qualitatively as follows: + +  >  1000 cpm and S:B  >  8; + = 500-1000 cpm and S:B = 3-8; +/- = 150-500 cpm and S:B = 2-3.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Values shown are the average from duplicate determinations which in most cases differed by 30% or less.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	278	  We also determined the sensitivity of these mutant proteins to inhibitor 2 (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	279	 3), an analogue of compound 1 that we have described previously (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	280	 A number of substitutions had little if any effect on interaction with E1 or on inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These included V64A and K68A, which interact with inhibitor molecule B in the inhibitor-TAD complex, thereby providing further evidence that binding of this second molecule is not relevant to inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	282	Substitutions I30V/M31L and I36M, which make the HPV11 TAD more similar to that of HPV6 E2, also had little effect on inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	283	 These results suggest that none of these three residues are responsible for the 30-fold weaker affinity of HPV6 E2 for compound 2 (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In further support that these residues do not play a major role in the type selectivity of the indandione inhibitors, we found that the corresponding mutations (V30I/L31M and M36I) in HPV6 E2 also had little effect on inhibition (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	285	Other substitutions (L15A, Y19A, E39A, and S98A) produced inactive or weakly active proteins.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	286	 In principle this could indicate either that these side chains are directly involved in interaction with E1, or that the mutant proteins are not properly folded.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The low signals obtained with the Y19A and E39A E2 proteins in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay were insufficient to assess inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	288	Substitution of Gln-12, His-32, Leu-43, Ser-65, and Ile-73 had a more deleterious effect on compound binding (IC50 values) than on interaction with E1, suggesting that these residues may have a specific role in binding the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, three of these substitutions are at the periphery of the inhibitor-binding site (Gln-12, Leu-43, and Ser-65), and Ile-73 is on the opposite face of the protein.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	290	 A possible rationale for these observations is discussed below.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	291	 In contrast, His-32 is in direct contact with the biologically relevant inhibitor A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The presence of a tyrosine instead of a histidine at position 32 of the E2 proteins of HPV16, -18, and -31, (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	293	 1) may contribute to the insensitivity of these proteins to the indandione class of inhibitors.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Consistent with this proposal, we found in other studies3 that an HPV31 E2 carrying the double amino acid substitution D31M/Y32H was significantly more sensitive to compound 2 (IC50 = 6  microM) than its WT counterpart (IC50 = 70  microM), when tested in an assay format similar to that used to generate the results reported in Table IV.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Finally, a particularly interesting result, which we have noted previously (23), was the improved affinity of E100A E2 for this class of inhibitors.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	296	Biophysical and Functional Characterization of Purified Mutant E2 TADs Because the roles of Tyr-19 and Glu-39 in the binding of E1 or inhibitors could not be assessed using the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay, we produced the corresponding mutant TAD proteins in E.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	297	 coli to carry out additional assays and biophysical studies.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	298	 We also expressed the L15A TAD, for which a moderately reduced affinity for E1 and inhibitor 2 were observed, as well as the I73A and E100A proteins, to better understand the significant effects of these two mutations on inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Analysis of all these proteins by circular dichroism indicated no significant change in secondary structure compared with the WT (data not shown).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The thermal stability of each mutant protein was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and found to be comparable with that of the WT TAD, with the L15A protein being reproducibly the least stable (Table V).

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Dissociation constants for compound 3 were determined using a tight-binding equation (see data in Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Parameters for inhibition of E1 ATPase activity were determined using a three-parameter logistic (WT, L15A, I73A, and E100A) or, when not possible, by estimation (Y19A and E39A), see data in Fig.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	307	  Next, we measured the affinity of each TAD protein for compound 3 (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	308	 3) using an equilibrium binding assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The Kd values for binding of 3 to WT and Y19A TADs were similar (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Because the side chain of Tyr-19 undergoes a substantial change in position upon inhibitor binding, the lack of effect of the Y19A mutation on the affinity for inhibitor 3 may actually be due to a combination of two offsetting effects: a loss of Tyr-19-inhibitor interactions partially compensated for by a reduction in the conformational change (entropic cost) necessary to form the inhibitor binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Further mutagenesis of this residue would be necessary to address this possibility.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The Kd value for 3 binding to E100A was roughly 10-fold lower, but could not be precisely determined in part because the value of Kd is well below the protein concentration used in the experiment (5 versus 50 nM).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	313	 I73A, L15A, and especially E39A had significantly reduced affinities for the compound.

0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	324	  We assessed the relative affinity of each of these TAD proteins for E1 by taking advantage of our earlier finding that the ATPase activity of E1 is inhibited by addition of the transactivation domain.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	325	 TAD binding significantly increases the apparent Km of E1 for ATP.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	326	 However, we observed that TAD-saturated E1 retained some ATPase activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	327	 We also reported a corresponding weakening of E2 binding in the presence of high ATP concentrations, which might play a role in the dissociation of E2 and assembly of E1 hexamers at the origin (40).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	328	Although not a direct binding assay, monitoring ATPase activity in the presence of E2 (or the TAD) provides a DNA-independent, solution-phase method of assessing the E1-E2 interaction.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Titration of WT TAD into E1 ATPase assays inhibited activity to a maximum of 86% (Imax = 86%), with an IC50 of 4 nM (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Similar results were obtained for I73A and E100A confirming that these mutations do not affect E1 binding substantially.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	331	 It should be noted, however, that the IC50 values reported for I73A, E100A, and WT TAD are close to the E1 concentration used in these assays (3 nM), and hence that these IC50 values are likely to be an underestimate of the affinity of these proteins for E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	332	The remaining three mutant E2 proteins (L15A, Y19A, and E39A) differed from their WT counterpart in two ways.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	333	 First, the maximal degree of E1-ATPase inhibition obtained at saturating concentrations of TAD was lower for these mutants than for WT E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	334	 This was more prominent for Y19A and E39A E2, which achieved a maximum inhibition of only 32 and 38%, respectively.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Although we do not completely understand why these mutant E2 TADs achieve a lower maximum level of inhibition it suggests that the geometry of the TAD-E1 complexes that do form for these two proteins is such that the complexes retain greater residual ATPase activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	336	 The second way in which these three mutant proteins differed from WT E2 is in their lower affinity for E1, as measured by the IC50 values required to reach their respective maximal level of ATPase inhibition.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	337	 By this measure, L15A was found to reduce only slightly, if at all, the affinity of E2 for E1, whereas Y19A and E39A had a larger effect.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Qualitatively, these results are in good agreement with those obtained in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay (Table IV) in that the E1-E2 interaction is little affected by I73A and E100A, moderately affected by L15A, but more significantly reduced by Y19A and, as anticipated, by E39A.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Notably, all mutant proteins retained some ability to interact with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	340	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Structure of HPV11 E2 TAD The tertiary structure of the HPV11 E2 TAD is nearly identical to that of the analogous domain from HPV16 (20).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	341	 In particular, the orientations of the two subdomains are similar for both TADs, suggesting that the relative position of these subdomains is a fundamental characteristic of this -fold, and that the overall structure is fairly rigid even though it is far from globular.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	342	 This idea is further supported by the fact that neither the binding of the indandione inhibitor nor the differing crystal packing arrangements of the three structures significantly altered the observed tertiary structure.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	343	Based on the structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD, Antson et al.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	344	 (20) proposed the existence of an additional E2 dimerization interface within the TAD, comprised of the second and third -helices, and notably involving a cluster of conserved residues (Arg-37, Ala-69, Ile-73, Gln-76, Leu-77, Glu-80, and Thr-81).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Although the area of this interface is relatively large (2000 A2), it contains a number of water-mediated interactions and relatively few hydrophobic residue contacts, in contrast to most protein interfaces that are typically less hydrophilic than solvent-exposed surfaces (45, 46).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Our observation that quite distinct monomer-monomer interactions are found in both of our HPV11 TAD structures, together with the results from chromatography and ultracentrifugation experiments that the HPV11 TAD is fully monomeric at concentrations up to 20  microM calls into question the generality of the TAD dimerization interface and thus the likelihood that it plays a fundamental role in the function of E2, at least in the case of HPV11.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	347	Nature of the Inhibitor Binding Site The inhibitor binding pocket (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	348	 7) is not present in the E2 apo structure but rather appears to be induced upon inhibitor binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	349	 This pocket is comprised of a large "shallow end" approximately defined by residues Gln-12, Glu-39, Lys-68, and Gln-71 and a smaller "deep end" defined by His-32, Trp-33, and Leu-94.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	350	 The indandione moiety of inhibitor A is complementary to the deep end, and the resulting Van der Waals interactions, together with the hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate and backbone amides, account for the strongly exothermic binding of compounds in this series (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Additional interactions are made by the thiadiazoylphenyl moiety that extends out of the pocket, near Met-101.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	352	Conclusions Based on Studies with Mutant E2 Proteins The Side Chain of Glu-100 May Impede Inhibitor Binding Mutation of Glu-100 to Ala did not affect substantially the interaction of E2 with E1, but specifically enhanced inhibitor binding as we reported previously (23).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	353	 The structure of the inhibitor-TAD complex provides an explanation for this gain in affinity, namely that the entropic cost associated with the conformational change in the Glu-100 side chain necessary for compound binding (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	354	 5C) is likely reduced in the case of Ala-100.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	355	Amino Acids Outside the Pocket Can Reduce Inhibitor Binding A number of substitutions (Q12A, L15A, L43A, S65A, and I73A) clearly affected binding of the inhibitor, although they changed residues that do not directly contact the inhibitor in the structure.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Further structural information would be required to fully understand the effects of these five substitutions, but all of these residues are located on helices in the three-helix bundle that defines the N-terminal subdomain of the TAD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	357	 The residues that form the deep pocket that binds tightly to the indandione moiety are also located within this three-helix bundle, and given the close fit between the inhibitor and this pocket it is possible that these substitutions subtly affect the packing of the three helices in a way that slightly alters the binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Perhaps similar subtle conformational changes explain why the indandione class of inhibitors binds to HPV6 E2 10-30-fold less tightly than to HPV11 E2, because the few amino acid differences in or near the binding pocket did not account for this type of differential activity.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The effects of these non-binding site residue differences are conceptually similar to some HIV protease resistance mutations that occur well outside of the active site (47).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	360	Importance of His-32 for Inhibitor Binding We found that the specificity for inhibitor binding to low-risk rather than high-risk HPV types is in part because of a residue forming the pocket, His-32, which is a tyrosine in high risk types (Fig.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Substitution of His-32 for tyrosine in HPV11 E2 abrogated inhibitor binding, although it did not significantly affect interaction with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Based on our structure of the inhibitor-TAD complex, this substitution is predicted to prevent formation of the deep end of the inhibitor binding pocket.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Furthermore, the converse experiment of inserting His-32 into HPV31 E2 generated a mutant protein that could interact with compound 2, albeit not to the same extent as HPV11 or HPV6 E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	364	A Role for Tyrosine 19 in Binding to E1 Tyr-19 is highly conserved among HPV types although it is an Ile in bovine papillomaviruses.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Substitution of this residue by Ala resulted in an HPV11 E2 protein that was still capable of binding the inhibitor and whose melting temperature and CD spectrum were very similar to that of wild type E2, indicating that this mutation does not affect the overall structure of the TAD.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	366	 However, the Y19A mutant protein was defective in binding to E1 both in an E1-E2-ori complex formation assay and in an E1-ATPase inhibition assay.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Thus, this mutation appears to specifically affect E1 binding.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	368	 The proximity on the TAD surface of Tyr-19 to Glu-39, the only other residue specifically implicated in binding to E1, suggests that this surface of E2 might form part of the E1-E2 protein-protein interface.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	369	 If so, our results would imply that the interaction of Tyr-19 with E1 is energetically important for formation of this interface and that the indandione class of inhibitors antagonizes E1 binding by competing directly for the same or an overlapping binding surface on E2.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	370	 In fact, the structure of an HPV18 E1-E2 TAD complex has recently been determined, and Tyr-19 does appear to make an important interaction with E1.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	371	Analysis of the two crystal structures presented here has provided a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which the indandione inhibitors bind to E2, to disrupt the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Comparison of these two structures revealed the induced fit mechanism by which the inhibitor binding pocket is formed and further illustrates that it is very difficult to accurately identify binding pockets or model protein-ligand interactions using only the structure of an unliganded protein (48).
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The binding pocket includes both a deep, narrow cavity filled by the indandione moiety, as well as a wider shallow region that makes only a few contacts with the inhibitor.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	374	 The finding that a second inhibitor molecule can bind to this shallow region of the pocket raises the possibility that molecules could be found that would retain specific interactions with the deep cavity but gain additional binding energy by interaction with the larger shallow region.
0.33389336.14634007.html.plaintext.txt	375	 The characterization of a well defined small molecule binding pocket on the E2 TAD represents an important step toward the design of HPV antivirals.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	7	To better characterize the enzymatic activities required for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA replication, the E1 helicases of HPV types 6 and 11 were produced using a baculovirus expression system.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The purified wild type proteins and a version of HPV11 E1 lacking the N-terminal 71 amino acids, which was better expressed, were found to be hexameric over a wide range of concentrations and to have helicase and ATPase activities with relatively low values for Km(ATP) of 12  microM for HPV6 E1 and 6  microM for HPV11 E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Interestingly, the value of Km(ATP) was increased 7-fold in the presence of the E2 transactivation domain.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In turn, ATP was found to perturb the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to DNA.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	14	The papillomaviruses (PVs)1 are small, nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect and replicate in the cutaneous or mucosal epithelia of humans and other mammals.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	15	 There are over 100 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), which cause conditions ranging from plantar warts (HPV1) and genital warts (HPV6 and -11) to cervical cancer (HPV16, -18, and -31).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	16	 HPV6 and -11 are also responsible for laryngeal papillomatosis, a rare but very serious infection of the respiratory tract (1).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Antiviral agents capable of specifically inhibiting PV replication could play an important role in the treatment of these diseases, but none exist at this time.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	18	Despite their host and tissue specificity, all of the PV types share a common genomic organization.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The closed, circular genome of ~8000 base pairs codes for only 10 proteins: eight early proteins termed E1-E8 and two late proteins, L1 and L2, that make up the viral coat (2).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	20	 E1 and E2 are the only viral proteins required for HPV DNA replication (3, 4).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	21	 E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that serves to regulate both transcription and DNA replication.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	22	 E1, a DNA helicase, is the only PV protein that possesses enzymatic activity (5) and is also the most highly conserved of the PV proteins.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	23	 For these reasons, E1 has been considered as the most attractive molecular target for the development of antiviral agents (6).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	24	During the initiation of PV DNA replication, E2 serves as a specificity factor to enhance binding of E1 monomers to the origin, which by themselves bind to double-stranded DNA with little sequence specificity (4, 7-11).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	25	 E2 dimers bind with high specificity to DNA sequences within the origin and recruit to it E1 monomers, through direct protein-protein interactions (12, 13).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Upon binding to DNA, E1 monomers assemble into hexamers (14, 15), but the E1-E2 interaction is not maintained (16, 17).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, the role of E2 is to catalyze the assembly of hexameric E1 complexes specifically at the origin.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	28	 ATP hydrolysis is also required for E1 hexamers to distort the origin and encircle single strands of DNA (18).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Using in vitro translated HPV11 proteins, we have previously shown that ATP binding stimulates the E2-dependent association of E1 with the origin (19).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	30	 ATP binding does not affect the E2 binding step or the E1-E2 interaction but rather a subsequent process, either oligomerization and binding of E1 to DNA or the stability of the assembled E1-origin DNA complex (19, 20).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	31	 ATP hydrolysis is not required in this case, since the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPS and ADP have similar effects.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For BPV, it has been demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis is required for displacement of E2 from the origin during assembly of E1 multimeric complexes (17).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Either concurrent with or after formation of E1 oligomers, the host polymerase  primase (21-25) and possibly also replication protein A (22, 26) bind to E1, and a replication complex is formed together with additional host factors.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	34	We and others have identified subdomains of E1 as well as conserved amino acids that are required for a number of its DNA replication activities.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We have recently shown that amino acids 166-649 of E1 efficiently support DNA replication in a cell-free system and thus must encode for all necessary binding and enzymatic activities required in vitro (25).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In vivo, additional sequences spanning amino acids 82-128 (HPV11 E1) are required; these contain an extended nuclear localization sequence (27, 28) as well as a cyclin-binding motif and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites (29-31).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A minimal DNA binding/origin recognition sequence was mapped to approximately amino acids 140-300 for BPV E1 (32-35) (amino acids 185-345 for HPV11 E1), although the entire C terminus of the protein (amino acids 186-649) is required to observe stable binding of HPV11 E1 to the origin (20, 36).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	38	 An HPV11 E1 truncation consisting of the C-terminal amino acids 353-649 retains the ability to bind to E2 or the p70 subunit of polymerase  primase and to oligomerize into hexamers (19, 20, 25).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Within this C-terminal fragment of E1 are four conserved regions termed A, B, C, and D (see Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	40	 1), which are highly similar to the functionally related T antigens of SV40 and polyomaviruses (37).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The conserved region A lies in a minimal E1 oligomerization sequence located within amino acids 353-416 (see Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Three motifs characteristic of superfamily 3 of NTP-binding proteins are located between amino acids 478 and 525 of HPV11 E1 (see Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Two of these motifs (motifs a and b) correspond to the Walker A and B boxes involved in binding the substrate nucleotide triphosphate-magnesium complex (39), while the exact function of the third motif (motif c) remains unclear.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Mutations of conserved residues in all three motifs have been shown to significantly decrease the ATPase activity of the superfamily 3 helicase Rep68, encoded by the adeno-associated virus (40).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Mutation of a highly conserved lysine in motif a (Lys484 in HPV11 E1) has been shown to abrogate the ATPase activity of BPV E1 (41) and HPV11 E1 (42), as also observed for many other ATPases (43).

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The region of HPV11 E1 that corresponds to the minimal DNA-binding domain mapped in BPV E1-(32-35) is also indicated as a black box.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The locations of conserved motifs a, b, and c that are common to members of superfamily 3 NTP-binding proteins (38) are indicated by arrows.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Indicated below E1 are truncated constructs of the protein that we have found in previous studies to be sufficient for catalyzing DNA replication in a cell-free system, for stable binding to the origin, for interaction with the transactivation domain of E2 (19) or the p70 subunit of polymerase  primase (25), or for oligomerization of the protein (20).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The position of a minimal E1-E1 interaction domain mapped between amino acids 353 and 416 using the yeast two-hybrid system (20) is indicated by a hatched box.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	53	Most studies on the enzymatic activities of purified E1 have been carried out using the BPV enzyme, purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (5, 41, 44, 45) or Escherichia coli (15, 46).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Although the HPV E1 proteins are 40-50% identical in primary sequence to BPV E1 and presumably have very similar structures and mechanisms of action, it has proven very difficult to isolate sufficient quantities of purified HPV enzymes to characterize their enzymatic activities.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Very low levels of expression, compounded by proteolysis and contamination with other proteins, have commonly been observed.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Of the few reports on the isolation of HPV E1 (42, 47-49), in only one case was sufficient material obtained for a basic characterization of helicase activity and biophysical properties (42).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	57	 (50) have reported the isolation of epitope-tagged HPV11 E1 that is functional for in vitro DNA replication assays, but the enzymatic activities of their E1 preparations have not been described.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	58	In this report, we present our characterization of the enzymatic activities of HPV11 and -6 E1 helicases.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	59	 We have made extensive use of an N-terminal truncated form of E1, composed of amino acids 72-649, which we have shown previously is as active as wild type E1 in supporting HPV DNA replication in vitro.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	60	 We report here that this truncated E1 is expressed in significantly greater yield than full-length E1 and has improved biophysical properties.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	61	 We show that, in contrast to previous reports (41, 42, 45, 49), our purified E1 preparations have a relatively low value of Km(ATP), well below the physiological concentration of ATP.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	62	 We show that high concentrations of the E2 transactivation domain raise the apparent value of Km(ATP) and also demonstrate that the binding of ATP-Mg to E1 weakens its interaction with E2.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The perturbation of E1-E2 binding by physiological concentrations of ATP suggests a mechanism by which some of the energy gained by tight binding of ATP is used to destabilize the E1-E2 complex, which forms transiently during the initiation of viral DNA replication.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	64	 We also show that E1-(353-649), which encodes motifs for enzymatic activity but lacks the previously identified minimal origin-DNA binding region, is fully active in ATPase, helicase, and ssDNA binding assays.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Thus, while the N-terminal half of E1 is necessary for replication from the HPV origin, all sequences necessary for proper folding, oligomerization, and enzymatic catalysis are within the C terminus.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	199	Expression and Purification of HPV11 and HPV6 E1-- We initially attempted to purify E1 after overexpression in E.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, we consistently found HPV E1 expressed in bacteria to be largely insoluble and the soluble protein to be partially degraded.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Preparations of E1 proteins with amino acid substitutions of the essential Lys484 in the Walker A phosphate-binding motif retained helicase and ATPase activities, demonstrating that bacterially produced E1 copurified with contaminating helicases and ATPases (data not shown).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	202	 As a result of these experiences, we decided to express HPV E1 in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed to express full-length HPV11 and HPV6 E1 as well as a slightly shorter version of HPV11 E1, encompassing amino acids 72-649.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	204	 A similar truncation of HPV33 E1 was reported to be expressed at higher levels than the full-length protein in E.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Furthermore, we have shown previously that this truncated E1, when made by in vitro translation, retains the ability to support cell-free DNA replication (25).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These three E1 proteins were expressed as fusions with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag to facilitate their rapid purification by metal affinity chromatography and hence minimize losses of activity over the course of the procedure.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Finally, in order to rule out the possibility that the enzymatic activities associated with our E1 preparations were due to contaminating proteins, we also expressed several catalytically inactive HPV11 E1 proteins containing single amino acid substitutions at lysine 484.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We showed previously, using in vitro translated proteins, that HPV11 E1 in which Lys484 is substituted by alanine, histidine, isoleucine, or arginine retains the ability to form a specific complex with E2 at the HPV origin (19).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These substitutions were made in the context of the full-length HPV11 E1 protein, and the alanine and arginine changes were also made in E1-(72-649).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	210	In agreement with previous work, we found that during expression in baculovirus-infected SF21 cells E1 accumulated in the nuclei, with only a small proportion in the cytosolic fraction.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	211	 E1 was extracted from nuclei with a buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, but in further experiments, we found that full-length HPV6 and HPV11 E1 could be extracted from nuclei using a buffer with no added salt.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This unusual low salt extraction was as efficient as a more standard high salt procedure at extracting soluble wild type E1, with the advantage that significantly fewer contaminating proteins were present in the low salt extracts, so that the final product obtained after chromatography was more pure (data not shown).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Due to the higher expression level obtained for E1-(72-649), very pure E1 could be isolated in relatively good yield after high salt extraction.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Following extraction, all three E1 proteins were purified in a single nickel affinity chromatography step.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Collectively, these results demonstrate that E1 is responsible for the activity detected in WT E1 preparations.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	244	 HPV6 E1 preparations were not validated in the same way; but given the complete lack of activity of HPV11 mutant proteins purified by the same procedure and the similarity of HPV6 E1 to HPV11 E1 in terms of sequence, behavior during purification, and enzymatic properties as reported below, it is very unlikely that contaminating proteins are responsible for the activity of HPV6 preparations.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	372	 To achieve this, we made use of the fact that the ATPase activity of in vitro translated E1 protein can be assayed qualitatively following immunoprecipitation of the protein from a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	373	 By performing such an assay on a series of truncated HPV11 E1 proteins, we determined that the C-terminal half of E1, comprising amino acids 353-649, is necessary and sufficient for ATPase activity (Fig.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	383	 ATPase activity was normalized relative to the amount of immunoprecipitated protein as for A and is indicated relative to that of FLAG-tagged E1-(72-649), which was set arbitrarily at 100%.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	384	As mentioned in the Introduction, this portion of the protein encompasses four highly conserved regions termed A, B, C, and D that are shared between E1 and the large T antigens of SV40 and other polyomaviruses (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	385	 To confirm the importance of these regions for ATPase activity, mutant HPV11 E1-(72-649) proteins containing amino acid substitutions at highly conserved residues of region A and D and of the three conserved NTP-binding motifs were synthesized in vitro and tested for ATPase activity (Table III).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Amino acid substitutions in the NTP-binding domain, of lysine 484 in motif a (P-loop) or of the two aspartate residues at positions 522 and 523 in motif b, dramatically affected ATPase activity, as anticipated.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Another substitution in the P-loop, P479S, also reduced but did not completely abolish ATPase activity, in contrast to what was observed for E1 of BPV1 (41) and HPV6b (49), but in agreement with a previous report for full-length HPV11 E1 (42).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	388	 This result is also consistent with our earlier observation that the P479S substitution does not completely abolish the ability of HPV11 E1 to support transient HPV DNA replication in vivo (19).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Substitutions T566A and N568A in motif c also reduced ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Although the exact function of motif c is not yet clear, these results support its importance in ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Altogether, these results confirm the importance of motifs a, b, and c for ATPase activity.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	395	The ATPase activity of E1 also proved to be affected by some but not all amino acid substitutions in conserved region A, in the minimal E1 oligomerization region.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Three substitutions, Y380A, N389A, and F393A, severely hampered activity while two others, A390G and Q399A, reduced activity slightly.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Only the F378A mutant protein had activity comparable with that of wild type E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	398	 These substitutions and those in the NTP-binding motifs were shown to have at most a slight effect on the interaction of E1 with E2 (19, 20), and they also do not affect interaction with the p70 subunit of polymerase  primase,4 indicating that their deleterious effect on ATPase activity is not related to a dramatic change in the structure of E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Hence, these results support the notion that region A is needed for ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Similarly, the fact that one of the two region D substitutions, N609A, has a negative effect on ATPase activity is consistent with a role for this region in ATP-binding and/or hydrolysis, either directly or indirectly.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	401	Enzymatic Activities of the Purified E1 Minimal ATPase Domain-- To further characterize the enzymatic activities of the minimal E1 ATPase domain, we expressed it in insect cells as a polyhistidine fusion protein using a baculovirus expression system.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	406	 As expected, both mutant derivatives were inactive, confirming that the ATPase activity observed for the wild type E1 subdomain was not due to contaminating polypeptides.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	419	Given that the C-terminal domain of E1 has ATPase activity and that we previously showed that this domain is able to assemble into hexamers (20), we wished to determine if it was sufficient for helicase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	420	 The purified C-terminal domain was indeed able to unwind M13-based substrates with efficiency similar to full-length HPV11 E1 or one-half that of E1-(72-649) (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Improved activity was observed for E1-(353-649) relative to full-length E1 at higher enzyme concentrations, suggesting that preparations of this protein contain lower levels of residual nuclease activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	422	 As anticipated, the two ATPase-defective mutant proteins were also inactive (data not shown).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	423	 These results indicate that the two known enzymatic activities of E1, helicase and ATPase, are encoded within the C-terminal 297 amino acids.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	424	Binding of Purified E1 to Single-stranded and Double-stranded DNA-- The finding that E1-(353-649) is able to unwind partial duplex DNA substrates suggested that this domain of the protein is able to bind to single-stranded DNA.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	425	 This is of significance, since the ssDNA-binding domain of E1 has not been mapped previously.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	426	 To examine more directly the binding of E1-(353-649) to DNA, we measured its binding to radiolabeled ssDNA or dsDNA probes (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	427	 In parallel, we also examined the DNA binding ability of E1-(72-649) and of the two mutant forms of E1-(353-649).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	428	 In these assays, E1-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-E1 antibodies coupled to beads, and the amount of co-precipitated DNA was detected by scintillation counting (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	429	 All four purified proteins displayed similar ssDNA binding activity over the concentration range tested (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	430	 These results suggest that the ssDNA binding activity of E1 is indeed associated with the C-terminal domain of the protein and is not affected by the two amino acid substitutions in the P-loop.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	431	 The C-terminal domain of E1 was also able to bind to dsDNA (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	432	 8D), but in contrast to what was observed with ssDNA, it showed a 75% reduction in activity compared with that measured for E1-(72-649).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Hence, sequences located between amino acids 72 and 353 contribute to dsDNA binding, as anticipated from the fact that they are also needed for origin binding (see Introduction).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Collectively, these results suggest that the ssDNA-binding domain of E1 is distinct from the origin-binding domain.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	435	Since the C-terminal helicase domain of E1 is able to bind to both ss and dsDNA, we performed competition experiments to determine if their binding to E1 is mutually exclusive.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	436	 In these assays, ~4 ng (8 nM) of unlabeled 20-mer oligonucleotide or 30 ng (20 nM) of a longer 60-mer oligonucleotide were required to inhibit the binding of E1 to the ssDNA probe by 50% (data not shown).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	437	 In contrast, 1300 ng of double-stranded linearized plasmid DNA were necessary to achieve a similar percentage of inhibition, suggesting that E1-(353-649) binds preferentially to ssDNA over dsDNA and that it binds to both forms of DNA in a mutually exclusive manner.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Finally, competition by plasmid DNA was the same regardless of whether the plasmid had been linearized or cut into 23 different fragments, indicating that the weak binding of E1-(353-649) to dsDNAs does not occur through the ends of the dsDNA molecules (data not shown).

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	440	E1 plays a key role in the replication of human papillomavirus; thus, understanding the activities of this protein is an important step in the search for improved antiviral therapies.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	441	 The expression and purification conditions outlined in this report have allowed us to produce sufficient quantities of full-length and truncated HPV E1 proteins to study ATP hydrolysis and nonspecific helicase activities in more detail.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Unlike the in vitro translated HPV E1 proteins we have used in previous studies, the protein expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells is isolated as preformed hexamers rather than monomers.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	443	 These preformed HPV E1 hexamers could not be easily converted into monomers in vitro, similar to what was observed by Rocque et al.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	444	 (42) with their preparations of HPV11 E1 isolated from the cytosolic fraction of baculovirus-infected insect cells.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	445	 As a result, we have been unable to compare the enzymatic activities of monomeric and hexameric E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	446	 However, in the case of SV40 T antigen, direct comparison of the monomeric protein and the preformed hexamers indicated that these have equal ATPase activity and similar helicase activity on partial duplex DNA substrates.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	447	In agreement with earlier studies on BPV E1 (46) and SV40 T antigen (69), we observed that preformed HPV11 E1 hexamers have nonspecific helicase activity but are inactive in catalyzing cell-free viral DNA replication.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	448	 These results suggest that HPV11 E1, like BPV E1 and SV40 T antigen, must be isolated in monomeric form to be active in cell-free DNA replication assays.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	449	 In support of this suggestion, we observed previously that HPV11 E1 expressed as monomers by in vitro translation (25) is active in a cell-free DNA replication assay.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	450	 The oligomeric nature of our purified E1 is also most likely the reason why the ATPase and nonspecific helicase activities could not be stimulated by ssDNA or by a forked DNA substrate, respectively.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Indeed, previous studies of BPV E1 indicated that ssDNA enhances ATPase and helicase activity by promoting oligomerization of the monomeric protein rather than by affecting the activity of preformed oligomers (46).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	452	The unwinding activity of our HPV11 E1 preparations appears to be similar to that reported previously for BPV E1 and SV40 T antigen and more recently for HPV11 E1.

0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	459	3 pM/h/nM for purified HPV11 E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	460	 This rate of unwinding appears similar to that observed by Rocque et al.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	461	 (42) for their preparations of HPV11 E1, which they reported had approximately 4-fold less unwinding activity than T antigen.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	462	 The helicase activity we measured for E1-(72-649), ~1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	463	6 pM/h/nM enzyme, is approximately 5-fold greater than that of wild type E1, despite the fact that both enzymes have similar ATPase activity (as shown in Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	464	 4C or by values of kcat and Km(ATP)).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	465	 The first 71 amino acids of E1 contain a high proportion of acidic residues, and removal of this region may account for the improved helicase activity as well as improved affinity of this truncated E1 for ssDNA (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	466	 We found this truncated E1 to be less prone to aggregation, which may account in part for its improved activities.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	467	Our characterization of the NTPase activity of purified E1 revealed that eight different nucleoside and deoxynucleoside triphosphates could serve as substrates in NTP hydrolysis and helicase assays.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	468	 These results extend those reported by Rocque et al.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	469	 (42) and are consistent with our previous findings that the same NTPs are also able to stimulate E1-DNA binding and oligomerization (20).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	470	 We also found that ATPS and ADP (but not AMP), shown previously to stimulate E1-DNA binding and oligomerization, inhibit ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Collectively, these findings reinforce our earlier suggestion that the E1 catalytic site can accommodate a wide variety of substrates.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	472	 However, the reproducibly lower activity we obtained with CTP, dCTP, and TTP suggests that there are nevertheless some constraints on substrate binding.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	473	 Surprisingly, using both TLC and scintillation proximity procedures, we obtained much lower values for Km(ATP) or other nucleoside triphosphates than those reported previously for HPV E1 (230-380  microM) (42, 49) or BPV E1 (750-1100  microM) (41, 45).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	474	 A similar value of 600  microM was also reported for SV40 T antigen (72), but in a later report a much lower value of 4  microM was given (73).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	475	 This latter value is consistent with another finding that a fluorescent analog of ATP has a Kd of 0.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	476	4  microM (74) as well as the finding that, in the absence of DNA, T antigen monomers oligomerize at half-maximal efficiency upon the addition of 10  microM ATP (69).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Our values for E1 are more consistent with the value of 4  microM for T antigen.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	478	 Although it is difficult to explain these differences, it is possible that some of the previously reported values were not obtained under true initial velocity conditions.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	479	 Furthermore, in one report on BPV E1, Santucci et al.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	480	 (45) observed biphasic rate versus ATP curves, which they suggest could be due to a contaminating ATPase in their preparations.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	481	 It is also noteworthy that the value of 230  microM reported for HPV6 E1 was obtained from a preparation purified as an E1-E2 complex (49); the presence of E2 may have affected the reported value (see below).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	482	 (42) did report a turnover value for the HPV11 E1 ATPase reaction of 8 min1 with saturating ATP, quite similar to our value for kcat of 16 min1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	483	We observed that the transactivation domain of E2, either in the context of full-length E2 or as a fusion with GST, had a significant effect on E1 ATPase activity at low ATP concentrations.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	484	 Even high concentrations of TAD had no effect at higher ATP concentrations despite the fact that E2 can still bind to E1 under these conditions (19).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	485	 In apparent contrast with our results, a previous study found that the presence of BPV E2 had no significant effect on the ATPase activity of BPV E1 over a wide range of ATP concentrations (45).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	486	 In that study, however, the activity of partially purified E1 was compared with that of a partially purified E1-E2 complex obtained by coinfection of insect cells with baculoviruses expressing both E1 and E2.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	487	 E2 was not titrated into the ATPase reaction, and it is not possible to estimate the percentage of E1 that remained associated with E2 under the assay conditions.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	488	 The inhibition we observed was specific, since neither GST alone nor GST-TAD with a change of Glu39 to Ala, which is known to weaken E1 binding (67), was inhibitory.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	489	GST-TAD appeared to modulate ATPase activity such that saturating concentrations of E2 increased the apparent value of Km (ATP) by 7-fold, while the value of kcat was unchanged.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	490	 A simple thermodynamic consequence is that saturating concentrations of ATP should weaken the binding of E2 to E1 to a similar degree (75), which we have provided evidence for using an E2-dependent E1-DNA binding assay, which requires interaction of E1 with E2.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	491	 In this assay, we observed inhibition only at low protein concentrations, consistent with the modest 7-fold decrease in affinity expected from ATPase experiments.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	492	 Binding of E2 to catalytically inactive E1 proteins was not significantly affected by ATP-Mg, suggesting that only productive substrate binding weakens the E1-E2 protein-protein interaction.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	493	 Since E2 affects ATP binding (Km) rather than hydrolysis (kcat), we would expect that ATP binding suffices to weaken the interaction of E1 with E2 (75), probably by inducing conformational changes in E1.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	494	 In virus-infected cells, where E2 is present at low concentrations but ATP is in large excess, this perturbation of E2 binding could promote efficient viral DNA replication, since previous work by us (25) and others (23, 24) has suggested that E2 must dissociate from E1 prior to association with the polymerase  primase.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	495	 Hence, saturation of E1 with ATP subsequent to E1 oligomerization may help release E1 from E2, and allow for its interaction with pol  primase.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	496	 It has been proposed that ATP hydrolysis is required for displacement of E2 from the origin concomitantly with the conversion of the initial E1-E2 origin complex into an enzymatically active multimeric E1-origin complex (17).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	497	 While our results suggest that ATP binding plays a direct role in weakening the E1-E2 interaction, displacement of E2 from DNA may in addition require ATP hydrolysis, for example to drive distortion and opening of the origin by E1 hexamers.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	498	 Additional work, ideally with purified monomeric E1, will be necessary to fully understand the sequence of binding and enzymatic events involved in the initiation of HPV DNA replication.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	499	We determined by deletion analysis that the C-terminal domain of E1 comprising amino acids 353-649 is necessary and sufficient for ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	500	 Shorter E1 fragments, which still retain the three ATPase motifs characteristic of superfamily 3 helicases (38), were inactive, indicating that sequences encompassing conserved regions A and D (Fig.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	501	 1) are also necessary for activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	502	 The requirement for these two conserved regions, and for the three NTP-binding motifs, was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	503	 Region A is part of the minimal E1-E1 interaction domain, and the effect of region A substitutions on E1 ATPase activity remarkably paralleled their effect on oligomerization of the protein, which we reported previously (20).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	504	 The in vitro synthesized E1-(72-649) that was used in these ATPase assays (either WT or mutant sequences) was probably monomeric, based on previous chemical cross-linking studies (20), although we cannot rule out that some of the protein may have oligomerized under the assay conditions and/or during immunocapture of E1 on beads.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	505	 Further studies will be required to address this issue.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	506	 Nevertheless, our results point to a functional relationship between the minimal E1-E1 interaction domain and ATPase activity, perhaps underlying the fact that oligomerization enhances ATPase activity.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	507	Contrary to our expectation, we found that the minimal E1 ATPase domain (amino acids 353-649) is also sufficient for nonspecific helicase activity and for binding to ssDNA, despite the fact that it lacks the minimal origin-binding domain.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	508	 A recent report indicated that the analogous C-terminal domain of SV40 T antigen, also lacking the origin-binding domain, is sufficient for binding to ssDNA, probably as a hexamer (76).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	509	 It has not been determined if this domain of T antigen has enzymatic activity, but on the basis of our findings with E1, this seems a likely possibility.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	510	 Despite encoding all of the sequences needed for nonspecific helicase activity, the C-terminal domain of E1 made by in vitro translation is unable to support cell-free DNA replication (25), presumably because it lacks upstream sequences between amino acids 166 and 353 required for binding to double-stranded DNA.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	511	It has been suggested previously that during the initiation of viral DNA, replication E1 must first function as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, albeit of low sequence specificity, prior to assembling into enzymatically active hexamers (9, 16, 77, 78).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	512	 Our results suggest that these two activities of E1, sequence-specific DNA binding and helicase activity, require different domains of the protein, with the N-terminal half of E1 being required primarily to function as a dsDNA-binding protein and the C-terminal half being sufficient for unwinding.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	513	 One could speculate that these two main activities of E1 may have arisen from the fusion of two independent functional domains during the course of evolution.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	514	 A similar domain organization is also likely to apply to other origin-binding replicative helicases and in particular to the related large T antigens of SV40 and polyomaviruses.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	515	 Recent electron microscopic images of T antigen double hexamers bound at the SV40 origin have indeed revealed that this protein is composed of two structurally distinct domains corresponding to the origin-binding and C-terminal domains, respectively (79).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	516	More generally, we note that the 34-kDa C-terminal helicase domain of E1 is similar in size to the smallest naturally occurring hexameric helicase identified to date, the RepA protein (30 kDa) from the autonomously replicating RSF1010 plasmid (80).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	517	 Furthermore, enzymatically active C-terminal domains of similar size have been identified for both E.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	518	 coli DnaB (81-83) and phage T7 gene 4 protein (84), which are hexameric helicases in the same F4 family as RepA (85).
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	519	 Interestingly, these catalytic C-terminal domains possess the same organization as E1-(353-649), with an oligomerization region in the N-terminal portion followed by additional motifs required for ATPase and helicase activities.
0.41806388.11304544.html.plaintext.txt	520	 This striking similarity between E1 and T antigen and these more distantly related helicases suggests that many hexameric replicative helicases may have a similar architecture, with a C-terminal domain of 30-40 kDa that is sufficient to support oligomerization around single-stranded DNA as well as ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These include the orphan nuclear receptor, SF-1 (8, 15, 21), an early growth response protein, Egr-1 (22, 23), a bicoid-related homeodomain protein, Pitx1 (9), and the ubiquitous transcription factor, Sp1 (11).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	22	 There are two Egr-1 and SF-1 binding sites that exist in a pairwise conformation interrupted by a Pitx1 binding site within the promoter-proximal 150 bp (24).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This configuration is conserved across many, if not all, mammalian LH promoters.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Numerous recent studies have shown that SF-1 and Egr-1 functionally cooperate to activate transcription (16, 24, 25) of the LH subunit gene.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition, Pitx1 further potentiates the activation mediated by these two proteins; however, this does not appear to require direct binding of Pitx1 to DNA (25).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Rather, Pitx1 can interact directly with SF-1 and Egr-1 to induce expression (25).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Sp1 regulates the rat LH promoter by binding two elements that reside further upstream in the promoter at (451/428) and (411/386) (11).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This region is less conserved across species than the promoter-proximal sequences, and its importance in other species remains to be determined.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	29	The relative importance of Egr-1, SF-1, and Pitx1 in regulating LH gene expression has been confirmed with targeted disruption of each gene in mice.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Mice deficient in Egr-1 exhibit a specific loss of LH gene expression, while the  and follicle-stimulating hormone  genes remain functional (22, 23).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This suggests that Egr-1 is a selective transcriptional regulator of the LH gene and may mediate differential regulation of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone within the same cell.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In contrast, mice deficient in SF-1 have a reduced gonadotrope population accompanied by attenuated expression of all three gonadotropin genes (26).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Whether this is due solely to a defect within the gonadotrope (21) or to an additional impact in the hypothalamus (27) remains to be determined.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Targeted disruption of the Pitx1 gene leads to gross defects in limb development (28, 29) as well as multiple pituitary effects (28).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Although gonadotrope number and expression of the gonadotropin genes is significantly reduced in these animals, there is not an ablation of either (28).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, while Pitx1 is important for LH gene expression and gonadotrope development, it does not appear to be essential.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	37	While earlier work focused on evaluating basal expression of the LH subunit gene, this rapidly evolved into analyses of the effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This reflects the exquisite dependence of transcriptional activity of the LH gene on pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, exemplified by the hpg/hpg mouse (30) that harbors a spontaneous deletion of this gene (31).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Mice harboring this mutation express the LH subunit gene at only 5-10% of normal levels (32), suggesting that "basal" activity of this gene requires activation of GnRH-induced signaling cascades.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Indeed, all of the factors described to date as being important for LH gene expression also contribute to GnRH induction (11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 24, 25).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the current manuscript, we report the identification of an additional pairwise cis-acting element that binds NF-Y (CBF/CP1).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In contrast to the previously described cis-acting elements and their cognate factors characterized for this gene, these sites are the first to be described that solely affect basal expression of this gene.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	91	Alignment of the Bovine  and LH Promoters Reveals Three Conserved Regions-- Production of LH requires coordinated expression of both the  and LH genes.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	92	 These genes must be expressed concurrently in a temporal and spatial pattern to form an intact heterodimer.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In addition, regulation of their expression by GnRH and gonadal steroids may involve similar mechanisms for the two genes.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Thus, we speculated that specific cis-acting elements may be shared between the two gonadotropin subunit genes as a means to confer similar signals for regulated expression.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	95	 To begin to identify targets for functional analysis of the LH promoter in transgenic animals, we examined the bovine gonadotropin promoters for regions of apparent conservation.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Therefore, functional activity was initially assessed by determining whether multimerized L1 or L2 elements could stimulate expression of the HSVtk minimal promoter when linked to luciferase.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	147	 An additional complex displaying a faster migration pattern was also observed in both heterologous extracts.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This interaction was considered nonspecific due to the increase in intensity that corresponded with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitors.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	149	 From these results, we conclude that the protein(s) that bind to LB1 are not cell-specific and are likely to be ubiquitous given their distribution in gonadotrope-, mammary-, and choriocarcinoma-derived cell lines.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	150	The L1 Element Contains a CCAAT Motif That Is Essential for Protein Binding-- To begin to discern whether the L1 element was functionally conserved in the bovine  subunit promoter, we performed EMSA with its L1 homolog, designated B1.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Interestingly, although homology analysis was utilized to originally identify L1, the B1 element did not bind any proteins with high affinity in EMSA with T3-1 nuclear extracts (data not shown).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	152	 While function of the B1 element within the context of the full-length  subunit promoter was not addressed, lack of protein binding in gonadotrope-derived cells suggests that this region was not important for transcriptional function of the bovine  subunit gene promoter.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	153	Only four nucleotide differences exist between the L1 and B1 elements.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Thus, the lack of high affinity binding of a nuclear protein to B1 could be used to rapidly discern the specific nucleotides required for protein binding to L1.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Similar to the 6/10 mutation, mutation of nucleotides 10 and 18 also resulted in loss of L1 protein binding.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In contrast, pairwise mutation of the two nucleotides outside the CCAAT motif at positions 18 and 24 resulted in no change in affinity.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	162	 These results implicate the position 10 nucleotide (the T of CCAAT) in protein binding and minimized the likelihood that binding involved specific sequences eight nucleotides downstream of the CCAAT motif.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	163	 To directly assess the importance of the C at position 6 of L1, an additional point mutant was used in EMSA.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Antiserum to the transcription factor Sp1 did not affect binding of nuclear factors to the L1 element but did retard the mobility of a complex formed with an oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to a consensus Sp1 element (Fig.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thus, we conclude that NF-Y, but not Sp1, binds to this site in the bovine LH promoter.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	223	 To determine the role of the L1 element in conveying GnRH regulation, female transgenic mice harboring either the wild type promoter or the L1 mutant promoter were subjected to an ovariectomy/antide treatment paradigm.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Ovariectomy removes negative feedback from ovarian steroids and causes an increase in GnRH synthesis and secretion from the hypothalamus that further results in increased LH gene expression (1).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Treatment with the GnRH-specific antagonist, antide, can block this increase (18).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Thus, the degree of repression of transgene activity following antide administration is an indicator of the degree of promoter responsiveness to GnRH.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	227	 To assess the impact of the L1 mutation, mice were ovariectomized and treated with either vehicle or antide for 10 days.

0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Both subunit genes respond to GnRH and sex steroids to promote synthesis and secretion of appropriate levels of the intact heterodimer (1).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Several elements have been defined for transcriptional control of both the  and LH subunit genes.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, a complete picture of LH gene regulation has not been resolved.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This has largely been due to the lack of appropriate cell culture models to study expression of this gene.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	247	Using transgenic mice, we and others have shown that the LH promoter-proximal region confers high level expression that is confined to gonadotropes and responds appropriately to GnRH and gonadal steroids (17-20).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In this report, we describe an inverted repeat element that binds to NF-Y and is important for full activity of the LH promoter in transgenic mice.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In contrast to the other elements that have been described thus far for this promoter, the distal NF-Y binding site is not required for mediating GnRH responsiveness.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Thus, two different classes of cis-active elements exist for the LH promoter.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	251	 These include basal and GnRH-responsive sites, both of which contribute to transcriptional tone.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Since expression of the LH gene is very low in the absence of GnRH (32), the so-called basal elements may play a role in amplifying a signal that must be initiated by GnRH acting through the promoter-proximal SF-1, Pitx1, and Egr-1 binding sites, as well as potential Sp1 sites.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	253	NF-Y is a ubiquitous CCAAT box-binding factor that is composed of three subunits (36).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	254	 It regulates both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters (35).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Functional NF-Y sites within promoters are usually closely associated with the start site of transcription, occurring within the promoter-proximal 100 bp (36).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, there are several genes that contain NF-Y binding sites that are over 1 kilobase pairs 5' to the promoter (35).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Both the L1 and L4 sites are located more distally than the typical NF-Y site.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In addition, this factor displays an almost strict requirement for the pentanucleotide CCAAT motif that can occur on either the coding or noncoding strand (35, 36).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	259	 While L1 harbors an exact consensus for NF-Y, the L4 site has a CCTAT motif on the opposite strand from L1.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Although the L4 site also binds NF-Y, it does so with lower affinity than L1 (data not shown).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The L4 motif has been observed in the cdc25 gene (37) as well as the MHC Class II DPA gene (38).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Interestingly, these sequences, like L4, all occurred in the reverse orientation on the coding strand.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Unlike the LH subunit gene, however, both of these genes are TATA-less.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	264	There are numerous examples of NF-Y cooperativity with other transcription factors (39-41).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It is particularly interesting to note that NF-Y can synergize with the transcription factor Sp1 (39, 41).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	266	 An Sp1 site has been characterized within the rat LH promoter that is immediately adjacent to a conserved NF-Y sequence (11).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Whether these two proteins synergize to activate the rat promoter remains to be determined.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	268	 With regard to LH promoters from other species, the Sp1 sequence is not conserved at this site, although the adjacent NF-Y sequence is.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Within the bovine LH promoter, we have shown that an oligodeoxynucleotide that encompasses the NF-Y site fails to bind Sp1.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Thus, the transcriptional regulation that occurs through this cis-acting element cannot be attributed to Sp1.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	271	 It will be important to determine if Sp1 consensus sequences located within other regions of this promoter can bind to Sp1 and potentially synergize with the NF-Y binding sites to activate transcription.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	272	Sp1 and the other factors that define transcriptional activity of the LH promoter have largely been characterized using heterologous cell culture systems.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	273	 These include the use of kidney fibroblasts (CV-1) (8, 9, 22), somatotropes (GH3 and GGH3-1') (10, 11, 24), and immature gonadotropes (T3-1) (13-15).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	274	 None of these cell lines express the endogenous LH subunit gene, and they are probably devoid of essential factors for activating its transcription.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	275	 While these models have allowed ascertainment of the ability of specific transcription factors to induce the LH promoter, most depended upon overexpression of those factors.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Thus, the relative importance of these factors in defining the transcriptional tone of the LH promoter within the mature gonadotrope is unknown.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The recently derived LT2 cell line, which does express the endogenous LH subunit gene (42), will probably present an ideal avenue to confirm studies previously performed in these alternative models.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Prior to development of this cell line, however, the only mature gonadotrope model effectively used for analyses of the LH promoter was the pituitary of transgenic mice.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Even with this cell line, the transgenic mouse presents the most physiologically relevant system to assess important factors in regulating expression of the LH gene.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In this regard, we have characterized a new site that is important for basal expression of this gene but not GnRH induction.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The function of this element contrasts with the previously defined GSE that was shown to be essential for pituitary activity as well as GnRH activation of this promoter in transgenic mice (21).
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	282	 While previous in vivo and in vitro studies have focused specifically on the promoter-proximal 150 bp, the studies presented herein indicate that additional sequences involved in regulation of promoter activity reside upstream of this region.
0.19470528.10777613.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Thus, any attempts to study the proximal promoter in isolation will probably result in a limited picture of the transcription control of this gene.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16)-associated vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is frequently a chronic, multifocal high-grade condition with an appreciable risk of progression to vulval cancer.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The requirement to treat women with VIN has recently stimulated the use of immunotherapy with E6/E7 oncogene vaccines.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Animal models have shown that E2 may also be a useful vaccine target for HPV-associated disease; however, little is known about E2 immunity in humans.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This study investigated the prevalence of HPV-16 E2-specific serological and T-cell responses in 18 women with HPV-16-associated VIN and 17 healthy volunteers.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	10	 E2 responses were determined by full-length E2 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation assays using E2 C-terminal protein.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	11	 As positive controls, HPV-16 L1 responses were measured using virus-like particles (VLPs) and L1 to GST ELISA with ELISPOT and proliferation using VLPs as antigen.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The VIN patients all showed a strong serological response to L1 compared with the healthy volunteers by VLP (15/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001) and L1 to GST ELISA (18/18 vs 1/17, P < 0 001).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In contrast, L1-specific cellular immune responses were detected in a significant proportion of controls but were more prevalent in the VIN patients by proliferation assay (9/17 vs 17/18, P < 0 02) and interferon- ELISPOT (9/17 vs 13/18, P=not significant).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Similar and low numbers of patients and controls were seropositive for E2-specific Ig (2/18 vs 1/17).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In spite of previous studies showing the immunogenicity of E2 in eliciting primary T-cell responses in vitro, there was a low prevalence of E2 responses in the VIN patients and controls (2/18 vs 0/17).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are extremely common in young, sexually active women (Ho et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	17	 While the majority of infections are inconsequential and short-lived, virus persistence is associated with anogenital disease, especially cervical carcinogenesis (Rozendaal et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Several observations have indicated that host immunity plays an important role in effecting viral clearance, and this has provided the impetus for the development of vaccines to prevent and/or treat cancer of the cervix and its precursor lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Most of these approaches have concentrated on eliciting specific immunity against the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are expressed throughout the spectrum of HPV-associated disease development (Borysiewicz et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	20	E2 has recently been proposed as a potential immune target for vaccines aimed at treating pre-malignant disease (Schiller  and  Hildesheim, 2000).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This has been supported by data from the cotton tail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) model, where vaccination of rabbits with DNA encoding CRPV E2 was found to protect against the development of papillomas following subsequent tumour challenge (Han et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	22	 There are limited data on responses to E2 in patients with HPV-associated disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Serology studies have provided conflicting results with IgA and IgG responses to a cryptic peptide correlating with antigen exposure in cervical cancer patients (Dillner et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1995), while IgA (but not IgG) responses detected using a baculovirus-produced E2 protein were associated with low- rather than high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN) and cervical cancer (Rocha-Zavaleta et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These assays variously can detect linear or conformational epitopes, respectively, so their lack of concordance may not be surprising.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A single study has investigated naturally occurring E2-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-associated CIN where helper T-cell responses to the E2 C terminus, but not to the N terminus, occurred at the time of viral clearance (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Clearly there is a need for further baseline investigations of naturally occurring E2-specific immune responses in patients with HPV-associated disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	28	VIN is associated with high-risk HPV-16 infection in over 90 % of cases and has shown a significant increase in incidence over recent decades, particularly in younger women (van Beurden et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It is a chronic disease characterized by recurrence following standard treatment (Herod et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It therefore provides an excellent opportunity for the study of naturally occurring HPV-specific immune responses in women with persistent high-risk HPV infections.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This immunity is likely to have arisen as a consequence of chronic exposure to the virus but may be insufficient to effect disease regression and virus clearance.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The relapsing and recurring nature of VIN is likely to represent an ongoing battle between viral and immune factors in the natural control of this disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Thus, a comparison of HPV-specific immunity in women with chronic HPV infections and in those without may provide some insight into those immunological responses that play an important role in the natural history of HPV-associated disease.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	34	We have previously described an interferon- (IFN-) ELISPOT assay, which facilitates the detection of HPV-16 E2-specific memory T-cell responses to E2 C terminus protein following its processing and presentation by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) (Davidson et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The advantage of this system is that it is not limited by the use of HLA-restricted peptides but rather allows the study of the full range of T-cell responses that may have arisen as a consequence of natural antigen presentation in vivo.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In the present study, we have measured the 86 amino acid C-terminal E2- and virus-like particle (VLP) L1-specific T-cell responses in women with HPV-16-associated VIN and healthy female volunteers using this methodology and proliferation.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	37	 HPV-16 L1 VLP-specific T-cell responses were measured as a positive control, since previous studies have found high proportions of healthy volunteers and patients with HPV-16-associated high-grade CIN to respond to this antigen.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In addition we measured full-length GST to E2- and both GST to L1 and VLP L1-specific serological responses in the VIN and control subjects.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The HPV-16 L1 gene was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGHLT (Pharmingen) and co-transfected with baculovirus DNA into Sf9 cells (obtained from Wei Zhang, Dept of Pathology, University of Cambridge).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The resultant supernatant was then titrated and used for infection.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Studies in cervical neoplasia have shown that antibodies against the viral capsids are seen concomitantly with or within a few months following acquisition of HPV-16 DNA in up to 70 % of those infected (Carter et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	163	, 1995) and are stable with time (Carter et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	164	, 1996), even after 15 years of follow-up (Shah et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	165	 There is therefore little evidence of exposure to HPV-16 in our cohort of healthy volunteers.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This may be partly explained by their lifetime history of normal cervical cytology, although genital high-risk HPV infections are frequent and not always associated with abnormal smears.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The cut-off values that were defined in this study for both assays were consistent with the absorbance values measured from sera from virgins (data not shown), suggesting that the normal sera were generally representative of a population not previously exposed to HPV-16.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In contrast, VLP- and L1-specific antibodies were associated with the majority of HPV-16-positive high-grade VIN patients (15/18 and 17/18, respectively) compared with just one of the healthy volunteers demonstrating seropositivity.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	169	A dominant antibody response in humans against HPV-16 capsids involves a type-specific epitope only present on assembled capsids and not on the individual pentavalent capsomeres (Heino et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The L1 forms pentamers when its N terminus is fused to GST and this can allow detection of other L1-reactive antibodies.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Thus, the GST to L1 assay may allow epitopes that are ordinarily hidden within the fully assembled capsid phenotype to become available for serological reactivity and this may explain why more responses were seen using this assay than with the VLP assay.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Previous studies of HPV-16 VLP-specific antibodies in women with high-grade VIN found approximately 60 % of patients to be seropositive, but these studies did not determine the HPV status of the lesions and therefore may not have identified HPV-16-negative disease (Hildesheim et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	173	We found HPV-16 E2-specific Ig in one of the healthy volunteers, consistent with this population's lack of exposure to HPV-16, but only 2/18 HPV-16-positive high-grade VIN patients were seropositive.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	174	 From previous studies, serological responses to the E2 protein appear to correlate with antigen exposure (Lehtinen et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, it is not clear how the different assays (baculoviral protein, peptide and GST fusion) for E2 antibodies can be directly compared.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In particular, we do not know whether the GST to E2 fusion protein has any native conformation in the ELISA.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Nevertheless, the relatively infrequent detection of E2-specific Ig responses in our VIN patient cohort may indicate a lack of E2 expression by high-grade VIN lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The E2 open reading frame is typically disrupted following virus integration into the host cell genome, a process that has been shown to occur during the malignant transformation of HPV-infected cells (Graham  and  Herrington, 2000; Peitsaro et al.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Multiple restimulation of normal donor T-cell cultures with autologous E2 C terminus protein-pulsed DCs was shown to induce CTLs capable of E2-specific lysis of autologous lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HPV-16 E2 (Davidson et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus, there is an E2-specific CTL repertoire available in normal individuals.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Other studies using overlapping peptides from the HPV-16 E2 protein have revealed a broad E2-specific T helper cell repertoire in healthy volunteers (de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	184	 DCs pulsed with HPV-16 VLP have also been shown to stimulate primarily type 1-dominated T helper cell responses (Lenz et al.

0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The specific release of IFN- by CD4+ Th1 cells and CD8+ CTLs following stimulation with E2 and VLP protein antigens may therefore provide a useful measure of those cell-mediated immune responses that are likely to be important in the natural clearance of HPV infections.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In the present study, ELISPOT responses to C-terminal E2 and L1 required a 4 day stimulation of T cells with autologous protein-pulsed DCs; a 24 h stimulation of bulk PBMC cultures with antigen was not sufficient to reveal these responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This suggests that appropriate antigen processing and presentation is necessary to demonstrate these low-frequency memory responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	189	VLP L1-specific T-cell responses were more prevalent in the VIN group compared with the controls, both by IFN- ELISPOT (72 % vs 53 %, P=NS) and by proliferation assay (94 % vs 53 %, P < 0 02).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	190	 All but one of the patients who were seropositive for L1-specific Ig also demonstrated L1-specific proliferative T-cell responses.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Twelve of these patients additionally showed L1-specific IFN- release by ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	192	 All but one of the healthy volunteers were seronegative for HPV-16 L1-specific Ig, but a significant proportion of the group were L1-specific proliferative and IFN--releasing T-cell responders.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In the absence of HPV-16 L1-specific antibodies, the T cells measured by these assays most likely reflect cross reactivity with, or shared, epitopes following exposure to other HPV types.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	194	 There is evidence for this in the studies of Williams et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	195	 (2002) for HPV-11 and Steele et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Overall, HPV-16-positive VIN patients have high levels of antibodies to the viral capsid proteins and these are likely to be capable of neutralizing the virus.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This antibody production is presumably also reflected in the high prevalence of T-helper responses measured by either proliferation or ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	198	E2 seropositivity is not prevalent in the disease and, as with T-helper responses (de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	199	, 2002), may reflect exposure to different HPV types with shared epitopes.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, there does appear to be a subgroup of patients with specific T-cell responses to E2, as measured by proliferation and ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These two patients were clinical responders in a trial of an HPV vaccine (E.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The clinical outcome may be a result of a shift in immune factors that clear the lesion(s) (which may be heterogeneous) and concomitant reduction in local virus immune suppression (Tindle, 2002).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	203	 None of the healthy volunteers showed evidence of E2-specific T-cell responses either by proliferation assay or by ELISPOT.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This is consistent with the results of Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	205	 (1999), who found no E2-specific T-helper cell responses in healthy control subjects using an IL-2 release assay (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	206	, 1999), but contradictory to the findings of de Jong et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	207	 (2002), who found frequent strong T-helper cell responses to HPV-16 E2 peptides in four out of eight normal donors.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	208	There are several explanations for the discrepancies noted in these studies.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Firstly, there was only evidence of exposure to HPV-16 in one of the healthy volunteers recruited into this study.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	210	 (2002) tested anonymous donors for E2-specific T-helper cell responses and had no details regarding the age, sex, cervical smear history or HPV-16 VLP antibody status of their subjects.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Secondly, the methodology used was very different.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	212	 used 30-mer overlapping peptides from the full HPV-16 E2 sequence.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Significant cross-reactivity was seen between particular HPV-16 E2-specific T-cell responses and homologous peptides from other HPV types.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, the measured responses may reflect priming with HPV types other than HPV-16 itself.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Furthermore, it is not clear whether all of the peptides investigated in this study are naturally processed by antigen-presenting cells in vivo.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In contrast, since the intact E2 C terminus protein was used to measure T-cell responses in this study, any measured E2-specific immunity must reflect stimulation with naturally processed peptides.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	217	 This is also true for the study by Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	218	 (1999), where E2 C terminus or N terminus proteins were used to stimulate PBMCs for 7 days before testing the supernatant for IL-2 concentration.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, the assays used in the present study should also test responses to the HPV-16 E2 N terminus, since it is possible that we are missing a significant response not evident in the IL-2 release assays (Bontkes et al.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	220	It appears that exposure to HPV-16-positive VIN stimulates both antibody and T-cell responses to L1 protein but these may not always be sufficient to clear the lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In contrast, E2-specific T-cell responses are rare, although a repertoire exists, so it is possible that their absence may facilitate the persistence of VIN lesions.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Without clear proof of E2-specific T-cell responses associated with lesion resolution, it is unclear whether a lack of responsiveness indicates the inappropriateness of the assay or a true absence of E2-specific T cells.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Nevertheless, these studies of immunity to an early and late HPV-16 protein in VIN provide a baseline for comparison of responses to vaccines such as chimeric VLPs including L1 to E7 to E2 (Schiller  and  Hildesheim, 2000).
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The challenge is to demonstrate such immune responses in patients at the time of virus clearance (systemic and local analyses), and for this, long term follow-up studies of large numbers of young women are required.
0.16015147.12867639.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This will resolve whether E2 is simply non-immunogenic or whether absence of immunogenicity is specifically associated with persistence of HPV-16 infection.

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Here we report results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 (HPV16) L1 VLP vaccine in healthy adults.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Methods: Volunteers were given intramuscular injections with placebo or with 10- or 50- microg doses of HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine given without adjuvant or with alum or MF59 as adjuvants at 0, 1, and 4 months.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	16	 All vaccine recipients were monitored for clinical signs and symptoms for 7 days after each inoculation.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Immune responses were measured by an HPV16 L1 VLP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an HPV16 pseudovirion neutralization assay.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The antibody titers were given as the reciprocals of the highest dilution showing positive reactivity in each assay.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	19	 All statistical tests were two-sided.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Results: The prevaccination geometric mean ELISA titer for six seropositive individuals was 202 (range, 40 to 640).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	21	 All vaccine formulations were well tolerated, and all subjects receiving vaccine seroconverted.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Serum antibody responses at 1 month after the third injection were dose dependent in recipients of vaccine without adjuvant or with MF59 but were similar at both doses when alum was the adjuvant.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	23	 With the higher dose, the geometric means of serum ELISA antibody titers (95% confidence intervals) to purified VLP 1 month after the third injection were as follows: 10 240 (1499 to 69 938) without adjuvant, 10 240 (1114 to 94 145) with MF59, and 2190 (838 to 5723) with alum.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Responses of subjects within each group were similar.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Neutralizing and ELISA antibody titers were highly correlated (Spearman correlation = .

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	35	 HPV16 is found in approximately 50% of cervical cancers, and types 18, 31, and 45 account for an additional 25% to 30% of HPV-positive tumors.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	36	Identification of HPV as a causal factor in virtually all cervical cancers implies that development of an effective vaccine against high-risk HPV could prevent the premalignant and malignant disease associated with HPV infection.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Since prophylactic viral vaccines have a long record as a cost-effective approach to prevent infection or modify disease, such a vaccine might also lower the cost of screening and treating premalignant cervical disease.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	38	 HPVs are DNA tumor viruses that contain oncogenes.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	39	 There might be theoretic arguments against the presence of such genes, which can disrupt normal growth controls, in a vaccine destined for normal individuals.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To develop a prophylactic vaccine against HPV infection, we and others (8) have, therefore, taken a subunit vaccine approach, analogous to that used successfully against hepatitis B-induced disease, including hepatocarcinoma (9).

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Recombinant L1 VLPs are morphologically indistinguishable from authentic virions, contain the immunodominant conformationally dependent neutralization epitopes present in authentic virions, and have the ability to generate high titers of type-specific neutralizing antibodies (8).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	43	Several trials of preventive papillomavirus vaccine candidates using L1 VLPs purified from insect cells have been conducted by use of the cutaneous cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), the oral mucosal bovine papillomavirus 4 (BPV4), or the canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) disease model in its natural host.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Three subcutaneous injections of CRPV L1 VLPs given without adjuvant, or combined with alum or Freund's adjuvant, protected rabbits against persistent infection and subsequent carcinoma after high-dose CRPV challenge (14,15).

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Similarly, dogs or calves given two intramuscular injections of COPV L1 VLPs (without adjuvant) or BPV4 L1 VLPs (with alum), respectively, were protected from subsequent oral mucosal challenge (16,17).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In the CRPV and COPV models, passive transfer of serum or immunoglobulin (Ig) G from animals immunized with the L1 VLPs protected naive animals challenged with the homologous virus, indicating that neutralizing antibodies were sufficient to confer protection (14,16).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	48	Since papillomaviruses are species specific and HPVs do not induce disease in animals (4), further HPV vaccine development and evaluation require studies in humans.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Therefore, as an initial step in demonstrating proof-of-principle, we developed a prophylactic recombinant HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine candidate, produced in insect cells with recombinant baculovirus, for testing in humans.

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	206	 As expected, most vaccine recipients became transiently seropositive for HPV16 IgM antibodies, which were usually detected in the sample taken 1 month after the initial vaccination.

0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Regardless of dose and whether or not adjuvant was present in the vaccine, each of the volunteers who received the vaccine demonstrated a serum immune response by 1 month after the second immunization (i.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The third immunization induced a further elevation in end point serum antibody titers in most instances.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	238	 These results complement, for a high-risk HPV type, a recent report of HPV VLP vaccination in a therapeutic setting (31).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In that study, multiple injections of 1, 5, or 10  microg of HPV6 VLPs, without adjuvant, were well tolerated in genital wart patients with HPV6 infections, and vaccination induced an increase in VLP ELISA titers in most patients.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	240	The most commonly reported side effect in our study was pain at the site of injection.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Most of the pain was mild and short-lived, consistent with other intramuscularly administered recombinant subunit vaccines, such as licensed hepatitis B vaccines (32,33).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Side effects were similar in recipients of placebo and recipients of 10  microg of vaccine without adjuvant.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	243	 However, recipients of the higher vaccine dose (50  microg) without adjuvant did report more side effects than the placebo recipients.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	244	 As expected, a greater proportion of recipients of HPV16 L1 VLP with MF59 reported moderate pain at the injection site than recipients of HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine given alone or with alum.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The proportion of subjects experiencing injection site reactogenicity after injection of HPV16 L1 VLP with MF59 was comparable to that reported with other investigational vaccine antigens given with MF59, such as hepatitis B surface antigen and herpes simplex type II gD glycoprotein (34,35).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	246	In this study, the adjuvant effects of alum and MF59 were evident in recipients of the lower vaccine dose (10  microg).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In addition, there was a dose-dependent response in the groups receiving vaccine without adjuvant or with MF59, although not in the groups receiving vaccine with alum.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Specifically, as determined by GMT ELISA titers, there was a marked increase in the immune response to 50  microg without adjuvant compared with 10  microg without adjuvant (10 240 versus 640), a modest increase with MF59 (10 240 versus 3480), and no increase in the ELISA titers seen with alum (3040 versus 2190).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Since at the 50- microg dose the ELISA titers in recipients of vaccine without adjuvant were comparable to the titers in the group that received vaccine with MF59, and even higher than the group that received vaccine with alum, there was no apparent benefit to using adjuvant at this dose when serum antibody titers were measured shortly after immunizations.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	250	 It is unknown whether these properties would continue to be true following a longer interval after the third vaccine dose.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Since the addition of MF59 adjuvant was associated with increased pain and induration at the injection site, the optimal immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile in the current study was obtained with 50  microg of HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine without adjuvant.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	252	 It is encouraging to note that, with the higher dose without adjuvant or with MF59, the final serum titers were about 40 times higher than those detected systemically after natural infection in the subjects who were seropositive before vaccination.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	253	The similar titers seen at the 50- microg dose with no adjuvant or with MF59, combined with the modest increase seen with MF59 at the higher dose, suggest that even higher doses of vaccine would probably not induce substantially higher antibody titers.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	254	 For alum, the 10- microg vaccine dose induced maximum ELISA titers.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	255	 A similar plateau effect was reported when alum was used for HPV11 L1 VLP vaccination of macaques (36).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Although we do not understand the basis for this phenomenon, two factors that can have a substantial impact on the immune response of antigens delivered with alum are the degree of antigen adsorption onto alum and the dose of alum used (37).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	257	 It is unlikely that the degree of antigen adsorption adversely affected immunogenicity because, in the formulation containing 50  microg of HPV16 L1 VLP with alum, more than 95% of the VLPs was complexed with the aluminum hydroxide.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	258	 However, even with high levels of antigen adsorption, it is possible that the concentration of alum was insufficient to induce a maximal adjuvant effect.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	259	 It is also possible that the VLPs in alum, which were stored at 4  degrees C, might have been less stable.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Such instability would presumably have affected only the 50- microg dose, which was given after the 10- microg dose.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	261	A predominantly IgG1 response was also not unexpected.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We have found recently that IgG1 is also the IgG isotype that predominates after seroconversion to natural infection (25).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Predominantly IgG1 responses are also commonly seen after other microbial infections (38).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In C57BL/6 mice, HPV16 L1 VLPs induce a more varied IgG response, with substantial amounts of specific IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 detected (Heather Greenstone, Ph.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Thesis, The Johns Hopkins University).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Whether this reflects a stronger Th1 type response to HPV VLPs in humans than in mice remains to be determined.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The inability to detect an IgG2 response in most vaccine recipients is unlikely to be due to poor sensitivity or specificity of the IgG2 assay.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In fact, the sensitivity/specificity of the IgG2 assay was superior to that of the IgG1 assay for isotype-specific human Ig control subjects (25).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	269	Neutralization assays are often considered to be the "gold standard" in assessing the immunogenicity of a prophylactic vaccine such as the one tested here.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	270	 When the month-5 sera from the groups that received the 50- microg dose of vaccine were analyzed for HPV16 peudovirion neutralizing activity, there was an excellent quantitative correlation with the ELISA titers.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This correlation held for individuals as well as for groups, further implying that the ELISA appears to represent an appropriate surrogate assay for the more cumbersome and expensive neutralization assay.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	272	For both assays, there was a remarkable consistency of response within each vaccine group.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The immunogenicity results seen here with the human volunteers parallel those obtained in animals, where consistently statistically significant immunogenicity and protection against experimental disease have been observed, even when adjuvant was not given.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	274	 It is likely that the particulate nature and regular array of L1 in the VLPs contribute to their high immunogenicity.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Perhaps efficient immune recognition is promoted by an interaction between the VLPs and cell surface pattern recognition receptors that bind the ordered external structure of icosahedral virions (39).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	276	It is not possible to know from these studies whether systemic administration of vaccine will protect against cervical infection under natural conditions.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	277	 However, the magnitude of the antibody responses in the human volunteers compares favorably with that seen in animal studies in which VLP vaccination, with alum or without adjuvant, induced protection from high-dose virus challenge (Table 6).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Although some caution must be taken in comparing studies in which different vaccination protocols and ELISAs were used, our overall impression is that humans and experimental animals respond similarly to VLP vaccination.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Animal studies demonstrating the ability of virus-like particles to protect against experimental papillomavirus challenge*   The animal models used experimental inoculation of abraded epithelium and tested cutaneous and oral mucosal infection, rather than genital infection.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, there are reasons to suspect that anticapsid antibodies generated systemically could at least partially neutralize natural HPV16 infection, even though HPV infection and replication occur in the epidermis of the genital tract.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	281	 First, it is likely that HPV infection of the basal cell layer requires microtrauma or abrasion of the epidermis (4).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Such disruption of the epidermis could expose the virus to serous exudate containing neutralizing IgG antibodies.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Second, in immune-mediated dermatologic diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris, circulating antiepidermal antibody traverses the dermal to  epidermal junction, suggesting that the basement membrane is not an impermeable barrier to immunoglobulins (40).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Third, statistically significant levels of IgG have been reported in cervicovaginal secretions.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Much of this IgG is likely the result of transudation from the circulation (41).
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	286	 (36) demonstrated in African green monkeys that parenteral immunization with as little as 10  microg of HPV11 L1 VLPs induced detectable IgG antibody titers in cervicovaginal secretions.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Although lower in magnitude, these titers closely paralleled the serum responses.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In addition, the IgG present in the cervicovaginal secretions was sufficient to neutralize HPV11 virus.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	289	 It is, therefore, plausible that parenteral immunization with HPV16 L1 VLPs could result in the appearance of HPV16-specific IgG in cervicovaginal secretions in humans.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Even if VLP vaccination did not achieve sterilizing immunity, it might, nevertheless, substantially modify the incidence and duration of HPV16-induced genital neoplasia by restricting virus replication and the extent of primary infection.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	291	 It is likely that a reduction in viral load would also diminish transmission to sex partners.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	292	The safety and immunogenicity profile obtained in this study encourages further clinical investigation of HPV VLP-based immunoprophylactic vaccines.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	293	 On the basis of these results, we have initiated a phase II trial of 50  microg of L1 VLP without adjuvant.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The key question of whether systemic administration with a VLP vaccine can confer protection under natural conditions must await the outcome of controlled efficacy trials.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	295	 If the vaccine were eventually shown to be effective, the type specificity of the neutralizing activity induced by the VLPs implies that protection would be type specific.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Since multiple HPV types are implicated in cervical cancer, a multivalent vaccine would be needed.
0.25418594.11181775.html.plaintext.txt	297	 A vaccine composed of the four HPV types seen most frequently in cervical cancer (types 16, 18, 31, and 45) would theoretically be able to protect against approximately 80% of cervical cancers (6).

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	3	To understand the mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) capsids are formed, we have reconstituted the assembly of immature HIV capsids de novo in a cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Capsid authenticity is established by multiple biochemical and morphologic criteria.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Known features of the assembly process are closely reproduced, indicating the fidelity of the cell-free reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Assembly is separated into co- and posttranslational phases, and three independent posttranslational requirements are demonstrated: (a) ATP, (b) a detergent-sensitive host factor, and (c) a detergent-insensitive host subcellular fraction that can be depleted and reconstituted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Assembly appears to proceed by way of multiple intermediates whose conversion to completed capsids can be blocked by either ATP depletion or treatment with nondenaturing detergent.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Specific subsets of these intermediates accumulate upon expression of various assembly-defective Gag mutants in the cell-free system, suggesting that each mutant is blocked at a particular step in assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, the accumulation of complexes of similar sizes in cells expressing the corresponding mutants suggests that comparable intermediates may exist in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	10	 From these data, we propose a multi-step pathway for the biogenesis of HIV capsids, in which the assembly process can be disrupted at a number of discrete points.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	11	The protein shell of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)1 virion, termed the HIV capsid or core, is composed of ~1,500 copies of the Pr55 Gag structural protein precursor (for review see Gelderblom, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	12	 For proper assembly of the capsid to occur, Pr55 chains must undergo myristoylation (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	13	, 1989), an NH2-terminal modification thought to occur co-translationally (Towler et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The myristoylated chains are targeted to the host plasma membrane where assembly takes place concomitant with RNA encapsidation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	15	 As capsids are formed, they bud into the plasma membrane, which results in envelopment and subsequent release of viral particles from the cell.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Coincident with these events, the immature viral particles undergo a maturation process, involving proteolytic processing of the precursor structural proteins and condensation of the capsids into collapsed, electron-dense cores (for review see Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	17	Much of our knowledge of HIV capsid assembly comes from studies of viral particle formation in cultured cells transfected with viral genes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	18	 EM studies of these cells have indicated that the plasma membrane is the site of capsid assembly (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Analysis of various mutants of Pr55 have revealed key domains required for efficient capsid assembly and targeting to the plasma membrane (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	20	, 1993; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, the actual mechanisms involved in coordinating the formation of an HIV capsid from 1,500 Gag monomers have not been elucidated.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Many important questions about HIV capsid assembly remain unanswered, including whether assembly is an energy-dependent process, whether host proteins are required for assembly to take place, and whether assembly proceeds by way of discrete intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	23	A major obstacle to addressing these questions experimentally has been the inherent difficulty of studying capsid assembly in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In cells, many of the events in question proceed extremely rapidly and are not readily amenable to manipulation, making it difficult to identify trans-acting factors and energy substrates that may be required for assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Development of a cell-free system that recreates capsid biogenesis would greatly facilitate a biochemical dissection and mechanistic understanding of capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	26	In this study, we report the development of a cell-free system for the assembly of immature HIV capsids that appears to reproduce known features of capsid structure and biogenesis, including the phenotypes of a variety of assembly-competent and assembly-defective Gag mutants.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We use this system to demonstrate that capsid formation can be dissociated into co- and posttranslational phases, each of which has distinct requirements.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The reactions that occur during the posttranslational phase are dependent on ATP and at least two independent host factors, distinguished by their sensitivity to detergent.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In addition, the posttranslational phase appears to proceed by way of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Expression of Gag mutants that are defective for assembly results in accumulation of these assembly intermediates in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Similar findings are obtained in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Together, these data indicate that HIV capsid formation is a regulated, energy-dependent, multi-step process involving trans-acting host factors.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	34	All plasmid constructions for cell-free transcription were made using PCR and other standard nucleic acid techniques (Sambrook et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Plasmid vectors were derived from SP64 (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) into which the 5 untranslated region of Xenopus laevis globin had been inserted at the HindIII site (Melton et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The gag ORF from HIV genomic DNA (a kind gift of Jay Levy, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was introduced downstream from the SP6 promoter and the globin untranslated region.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The GA mutation was made by changing glycine at position 2 of Gag to alanine using PCR.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The Pr46 mutant was made by introducing a stop codon after gly 435 which removes p6; Pr41 has a stop codon after arg 363 (in the COOH-terminal region of p24).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These truncation mutants are comparable to those described by Jowett et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To make the D2 mutant, amino acids from gly 250 through val 260 were deleted (Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	41	 All changes engineered by PCR were verified by DNA sequencing.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	42	Transcription with SP6 polymerase and translation of the transcription products in wheat germ extract containing [35S]methionine (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) were performed as previously described (Lingappa et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	219	, 1996) have found that standard in vitro translation systems, consisting of a cytosolic extract, amino acids, an ATP regenerating system, and in vitro synthesized transcript coding for Pr55 Gag, fail to support assembly of HIV capsids (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Since assembly of HIV capsids, as well as assembly of other retroviral capsids, is known to require myristoylation of Gag (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	221	, 1989) as well as targeting of Gag to membranes (Jacobs et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Translation of transcript encoding Gag in this cell-free system resulted in the synthesis of ~2 ng of Pr55 protein/ microl translation reaction (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	226	We expected some of these newly synthesized Pr55 chains to become myristoylated, target to membrane vesicles present in the cellular extract, and assemble into stable capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Other Pr55 chains might achieve some but not all of the steps in capsid assembly, and would therefore be detectable as heterogeneous assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	228	 To quantify the amount of assembly, an efficient method of separating assembled capsids from the remainder of the translation reaction was required.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	229	 This was achieved in two steps.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	230	 First, after completion of the assembly reaction, membrane vesicles were solubilized using the nonionic detergent NP-40.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This treatment, which removes membranes enveloping capsids but does not affect the integrity of fully assembled capsids (Yu et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	232	, 1994), should solubilize unassembled Pr55 chains that may be anchored to membranes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Secondly, the detergent-treated, completed reaction was size fractionated on a sucrose step gradient into a soluble fraction (containing material of  < 500-S) and a particulate fraction (containing material between 500- and 1,000-S) that would be expected to contain completed immature capsids (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Thus, while our standard translation and assembly reaction was carried out in the absence of detergent to allow association with membrane vesicles, analysis of the reaction product was performed in the presence of detergent, allowing the assembly status of the naked proteinacious capsid to be assessed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	235	We found that the particulate fraction from a typical translation and assembly reaction contained between 15 and 40% of the total Pr55 synthesized (see Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	236	 To assess whether this fraction contained properly assembled immature capsids, it was further analyzed by velocity sedimentation on linear sucrose gradients, equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl, and EM.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	237	 For comparison, authentic immature HIV capsids produced in transfected cultured COS-1 cells were analyzed in parallel.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We found that both detergent-treated capsids generated in the cell-free system and detergent-treated (de-enveloped) authentic capsids behaved as a relatively homogenous population of particles of ~750-S (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	239	 1, A and B), with a buoyant density of 1.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Additionally, cell-free assembled capsids and the authentic standard were identical in size as judged by gel filtration (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	241	 When examined by EM, we found that capsids made in the cellfree system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	242	 1 E, 1-4) were morphologically similar to authentic capsids released from transfected cells (Fig.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, on average, 25% of the radiolabeled Pr55 protein synthesized in the cell-free system assembles into particles that closely resemble authentic immature HIV capsids generated in transfected cells, as judged by EM appearance as well as the biochemical criteria of size, sedimentation coefficient, and buoyant density.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	246	To determine whether the process of capsid assembly in the cell-free system is the same as that which occurs in cells, we examined whether known characteristics of capsid assembly were also reconstituted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Studies in cellular systems have demonstrated that myristoylation of Gag is required for proper capsid assembly (Gheysen, 1989; Gottlinger, 1989).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This NH2-terminal modification is thought to occur co-translationally (Wilcox et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	249	 To assess the role of myristoylation in the cell-free system we omitted MCoA from the assembly reaction, or added it posttranslationally at 90 min into the reaction (when  > 90% of Pr55 chains have finished synthesis; data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In both cases, a dramatic decrease in capsid assembly was observed (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Consistent with these data, we found that a Gag mutant that fails to become myristoylated (GA) also does not assemble in the cell-free system (see Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	252	In cells, assembly of HIV capsids takes place at the inner surface of the host cell plasma membrane (Gelderblom, 1991; Wills and Craven, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Membrane targeting of Pr55 chains is directed by the NH2-terminal myristate moiety and by internal domains of the Pr55 polypeptide (Jacobs et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	254	, 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Wang and Barklis, 1993; Platt and Haffar, 1994; Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Studies using Pr55 mutations have shown that abolishing membrane targeting results in inefficient capsid assembly and failure of capsid release (Jacobs et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	256	, 1989; Bryant and Ratner 1990).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	257	 For this reason, targeting to plasma membranes is thought to facilitate the nucleation of Gag chains at a site within the cell where assembly, envelopment, and budding of the newly formed capsids can occur.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	258	 If immature HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system requires membrane fragments (which are present in the wheat germ extracts used), it should be sensitive to addition of detergent at concentrations that solubilize membranes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus, as a final criterion of authenticity of the cell-free capsid assembly reaction, we investigated the sensitivity of cell-free capsid assembly to the presence of detergent during the translation and assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We treated the assembly reaction with a gentle, nonionic detergent that does not inhibit any of the enzymatic reactions involved in protein synthesis (Walter and Blobel, 1980) and thus would not be likely to affect protein interactions involved in assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	261	 As expected, the detergent Nikkol added to a concentration of 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	262	1% at the beginning of the translation reaction had no effect on Gag polypeptide synthesis (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	263	 2 B, Nikkol at this concentration largely abolished capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	264	 This effect was not observed when Nikkol was used at a concentration of 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	265	002%, which is below that required to disrupt lipid bilayers (Walter and Blobel, 1980).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Furthermore, we found that Nikkol added after the completion of the 150 min assembly reaction did not diminish the amount of assembly, even when added to a concentration of 1.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Thus, it appears that whereas the completed capsid particle itself is not sensitive to Nikkol (even at high concentrations), assembly of this structure is inhibited by concentrations of Nikkol that are sufficient to solubilize membranes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	268	 These data are consistent with the idea that membranes are required for newly synthesized Pr55 to be efficiently assembled into capsids in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Thus, the dependence of assembly on cotranslational myristoylation and the apparent requirement for membranes indicate that capsid assembly in the cell-free system faithfully reproduces characteristics of capsid assembly that have been described in cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	270	Studies of capsid assembly in cell culture model systems have revealed that certain mutations within the Gag coding region disrupt immature HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	271	 As a third criterion for fidelity, we examined the assembly phenotypes in the cell-free system of four previously described mutations in Gag (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	272	 3 A): (a) the Pr46 mutant, in which the COOH-terminal p6 domain of Gag is deleted (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	273	, 1994); (b) the Pr41 mutant, in which the deleted domains include p6, p7, and the distal end of p24 containing the p24-p7 protease cleavage site (Gheysen et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	274	, 1994); (c) the D2 mutation, in which 10 amino acids of the p24 domain of Gag (upstream of the p24-p7 protease cleavage site) are deleted (Hockley et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	275	, 1994); and (d) the GA mutation, an NH2-terminal single amino acid substitution that abolishes myristoylation of Gag (Gottlinger et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	276	, 1989; Bryant and Ratner, 1990).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Upon expression in cells, only the Pr46 mutant was capable of producing viral particles indistinguishable from those produced by expression of wild-type Gag (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Each of the other three mutants fails to result in proper viral particle production and release (Gheysen et al.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	280	Assembly reactions were programmed with transcript encoding each of these mutations and the amount of immature capsid produced was quantitated as described in the legend of Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	281	 3 B, the Pr41 and GA mutants failed to assemble into completed capsids, while ~40% of the total translation product of the assembly-competent Pr46 mutant and wild-type Gag assembled into completed capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The D2 mutant appeared to have generated a small amount of material in the region of completed capsids, but further analysis of this material revealed it to be the trail of a large Gag complex (of ~400- 500 S) that does not comigrate with completed capsid (see Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Thus, like Pr41 and GA, D2 did not assemble into the 750-S completed capsid.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Together, these data indicate that the cell-free system appears to faithfully reproduce phenotypes of a variety of assembly-defective and -competent mutations in Gag.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	286	For optimum assembly to occur, the cell-free reaction must be incubated at 25 degrees C for at least 150 min (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	287	 We observed that whereas the majority of Pr55 synthesis occurs during the first hour of this incubation, significant capsid formation does not take place until the final 90 min of the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Thus, an aliquot of the reaction incubated for only 50 min contains ~60% of the full length Pr55 chains that are present in an aliquot incubated for the standard 150 min (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, essentially none of the chains present at the 50 min time point has assembled into capsids (data not shown), while at 150 min 25% have completed the assembly process (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	290	 This indicated to us that it might be possible to completely separate the translation and assembly phases of the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	291	 To confirm this, a reaction was split into two aliquots at 50 min into the incubation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	292	 To one aliquot we added emetine, which blocks translation by inhibiting chain elongation, and then both aliquots were incubated to 150 min.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	293	 While total Pr55 synthesis in the emetine-treated reaction was 60% of the control (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	294	 4 A, compare gel lanes 1 and 2), the proportion of capsid assembly in this treated reaction was comparable to that of the untreated control (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	295	 4 A, bar graph), indicating that assembly takes place even when translation is halted.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Based on these data, one would expect that manipulations performed after emetine treatment would have effects on only the posttranslational phase of assembly and should not affect Pr55 synthesis, which is already completed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	297	Having established a means of analyzing events specific to assembly, we then examined whether the previously described detergent sensitivity of HIV capsid assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	298	 2 B) was due to an effect on co- or posttranslational events.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We treated Pr55 reactions with emetine and 0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	300	1% Nikkol at 50 min into the reaction, continued the incubation to 150 min, and then determined the amount of assembly as previously described.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Under these conditions, assembly was dramatically reduced (data not shown), just as it had been when Nikkol was added at the start of translation (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Therefore, we conclude that the detergent sensitive step(s) in HIV capsid assembly occurs posttranslationally.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	303	Next we examined whether posttranslational events in capsid assembly are dependent on the presence of ATP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Translation of Gag was allowed to proceed for 50 min, at which point further protein synthesis was inhibited with emetine.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The sample was divided, and one aliquot was depleted of ATP by the addition of apyrase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes free ATP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	306	 After completion of the assembly reaction, samples were analyzed as previously described for the amount of assembly that had occurred.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	307	 We found that depletion of free ATP from the assembly reaction resulted in a dramatic reduction in capsid assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The effect of ATP depletion was not reversed by addition of the nonhydrolyzable analogues, AMP-PNP or GTP-S (data not shown), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis, and not just ATP binding, is required.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	309	 As expected, addition of apyrase did not change the total amount of Pr55 synthesis (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	310	 4 A, compare gel lanes 2 and 3).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Furthermore, adding apyrase to the reaction after capsid assembly was completed had no effect on the amount of assembly (data not shown), ruling out the possibility of an effect of apyrase or ATP depletion on capsid stability.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	312	 These data indicate that there is a requirement for ATP in the capsid assembly process, and that this ATP dependence is distinct from the energy requirements of protein synthesis.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	314	Given that the Gag protein itself is not known to bind or hydrolyze ATP, the requirement for this energy substrate suggests that a host protein or proteins are involved in the assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Demonstrating that such a host factor is required would involve showing that assembly fails to occur when this factor is depleted from the cellular extracts used in the assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Furthermore, adding back the depleted fraction to the reaction should restore assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Thus, we sought to fractionate the translation extract in a manner that would leave intact all of the components needed for translation but remove at least one component required for assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The cellular extract used for translation and assembly was subfractionated by ultracentrifugation into two portions: HSS and HSP.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The HSS, depleted of components that were 90-S or greater, supported Pr55 translation but not its assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This indicates that the HSP likely contains an assembly specific host factor(s).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	321	 This was demonstrated directly by showing that addition of the HSP posttranslationally (after emetine treatment) to unassembled Gag chains synthesized in the HSS resulted in a considerable restoration of particle assembly (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	322	 As expected, total synthesis of Pr55 was unaltered by addition of the HSP (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Together, these data indicate that a subcellular fraction of the eukaryotic cell lysate is required for posttranslational events in capsid assembly to take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	324	We had previously observed that detergent also disrupts the posttranslational phase of capsid assembly (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	325	 We examined, therefore, whether the HSP contained the detergent-sensitive component that is required for capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	326	 HSP was prepared from a cell extract treated with detergent (0.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The resulting HSP was washed with detergent-free buffer and added posttranslationally to an assembly reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	328	 We found that the HSP from the detergent-treated extract was as active in promoting posttranslational capsid formation as the control HSP (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Thus, separate detergent-sensitive and -insensitive host factors appear to be involved in the posttranslational phase of HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Furthermore, the detergent-insensitive host factor can be depleted by ultracentrifugation and then reconstituted by posttranslational addition.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	332	The existence of multiple specific requirements for HIV capsid biogenesis, including host factors and ATP, suggests that discrete biochemical intermediates may exist during the assembly process.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	333	 To date, such intermediates in capsid assembly have not been described, most likely due to the difficulty of detection in cellular systems where they would be present only transiently and in minute quantities.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Since the cell-free system is less efficient at forming completed capsids than are cellular systems, it might constitute a better system for detecting such assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Consistent with this possibility, we found that under conditions where only a small amount of 750-S capsid assembly occurs in the cell-free reaction, analysis of the reaction products on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients revealed the presence of a series of Gag-containing complexes, in addition to 750-S completed capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	336	 These complexes, which have calculated sedimentation coefficients of ~10-S, 80-S, and 150-S, will henceforth be referred to as complexes A, B, and C, respectively.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	337	If these complexes represent assembly intermediates, they would be expected to be present in large quantities at early time points, and to be diminished at later times in the reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	338	 To assess whether these complexes displayed this behavior, we used a pulse-chase analysis to follow a small cohort of radiolabeled Pr55 chains over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	339	 The cell-free reaction was performed with radiolabeled cysteine.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	340	 After the first 4 min of translation, an excess of unlabeled cysteine was added to abolish further labeling of subsequently synthesized Pr55 chains.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	341	 We observed that the total amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was the same at 25 and 150 min into the pulse-chase reaction (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	342	 5 B), indicating that neither further radiolabeling nor degradation of Pr55 had occurred after 25 min and confirming that the same population of Pr55 chains was being analyzed at both times.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Aliquots of the cell-free reactions were removed at the times indicated, treated with detergent, and then analyzed on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	344	At 25 min into the reaction, all of the radiolabeled Pr55 was found in complexes A, B, and C (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	345	 5 C), with no radiolabeled Pr55 present in the region of completed 750-S capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	346	 While complexes A and B appear as peaks at ~ the 10-S and 80-S positions of the gradient, complex C appears as a less distinct shoulder in approximately the 150-S position.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In marked contrast, examination of the assembly reaction at 150 min showed that a significant amount of radiolabeled Pr55 was assembled into completed capsids that migrated in the 750-S position (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Correspondingly, the amount of Pr55 in complexes A, B, and C was diminished by precisely the amount that was now found to be assembled, demonstrating that at least some of the material in complexes A, B, and C constitutes intermediates in the biogenesis of completed 750-S capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	349	At extremely short chase times (i.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	350	, 13 min), when only some of the radiolabeled chains have completed synthesis, full length Pr55 chains were found exclusively in complex A on 13 ml sucrose gradients, while nascent chains that are not yet completed were in the form of polysomes of greater than 100-S (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Thus, polysome-associated nascent chains of Gag constitute the starting material in this pathway, and the 10-S complex A, which contains completed Gag chains, is likely to be the first intermediate in the formation of immature capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	352	 It is possible, therefore, that complexes B and C represent later assembly intermediates in the pathway of capsid formation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	353	If complexes A, B, and C do in fact constitute intermediates in assembly, one would predict that blockade of assembly would result in accumulation of Gag chains in the form of complexes with those S values.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Furthermore, one would expect that blockade at different points along this pathway would result in accumulation of complexes A, B, and C in various combinations, as determined by the order of their appearance along the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	355	 For example, if an ordered pathway of intermediates exists, then blockade at early points in the pathway should result in accumulation of one or two Gag-containing complexes corresponding to early putative assembly intermediates, while blockade at a very late point in the pathway would result in accumulation of all the putative assembly intermediates but not the final completed capsid product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	356	 To test these predictions, we blocked assembly in a variety of ways, both pharmacologically and through the use of mutations, and examined the Gag-containing complexes that were formed.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	360	 2), and the reaction products were analyzed by velocity sedimentation as described for Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Material in fractions corresponding to the assembly intermediates and completed capsid were quantified and are presented in Table I.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	362	 The untreated reaction contained Pr55 in complexes A, B, and C, as well as a peak in the final 750-S capsid position, while the treated reactions, as expected, contained no peak at the position of the final capsid product (Table I).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Treatment with either apyrase or detergent resulted in accumulation of additional material in complexes B and C, but did not result in accumulation of additional material in complex A.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	364	 This is consistent with the idea that complexes B and C are the more immediate precursors of the 750-S completed capsids, and that these interventions block the conversion of complexes B and C into the fully assembled capsid end product.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	367	To determine whether the putative assembly intermediates accumulate when capsid assembly is blocked by specific mutations in Gag, cell-free reactions were programmed with each of the previously described assembly-competent and -defective Gag mutants (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	368	 3), incubated for 150 min, and then analyzed by velocity sedimentation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Reactions programmed with wild-type Gag (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	370	 6 A) or the assembly-competent Pr46 mutant (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	371	 6 B) were found to have nearly identical profiles, in which  > 30% of the radiolabeled Gag chains synthesized formed completed immature capsids (that migrate at 750-S), and the remainder was in the form of residual putative assembly intermediates A and B.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Thus, these two assembly-competent forms of Gag appear to be indistinguishable in the cell-free system just as they are when expressed in cells (Royer et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	373	 6 C shows the same analysis for the assembly defective Pr41 mutant.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	374	 We found that all of the radiolabeled chains at the end of the Pr41 cell-free reaction were contained in a single complex that peaks at ~10-S and corresponds to complex A.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Since the 10-S peak was very large and led to an irregular trail that could be masking 80- or 150-S peaks, we reanalyzed the products of a Pr41 reaction on a gradient that allowed high resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown) and confirmed that all of the Pr41 translation product was present in complex A, which was ~10-S in size.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Thus, in the cell-free system, it appears that Pr41 fails to progress beyond complex A, which is likely to represent the first intermediate in the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	377	Like Pr41, the myristoylation-incompetent GA mutant failed to assemble into 750-S capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	378	 6 D), but unlike Pr41, GA had distinct peaks in both the 10- and 80-S regions of the gradient (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	379	 These data indicate that the GA mutant, which contains the entire Gag coding region except for the myristoylation signal, is capable of forming complex A, which appeared to be the first assembly intermediate in the pulse-chase experiment, as well as complex B, but does not progress further towards forming completed capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	380	 These data suggest that complex B is likely to be the second assembly intermediate formed in the biogenesis of immature HIV capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	381	Previously, we had shown that in the absence of exogenously added MCoA, wild-type Gag failed to assemble in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	382	 2 A), consistent with previous observations that myristoylation is required for proper capsid assembly to occur.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Thus, a cell-free reaction programmed with wild-type Gag but performed in the absence of MCoA would be expected to be blocked at the same point in the assembly pathway as the GA mutant.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Consistent with this, we found that assembly performed in the absence of MCoA resulted in formation of only complexes A and B (data not shown), and therefore closely resembled the GA mutant shown in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	385	Analysis of a cell-free reaction programmed with the D2 mutant is shown in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Unlike the previously described assembly-defective mutants, D2 was found to form a spectrum of Gag-containing complexes, including peaks corresponding to complexes A and B (at ~10- and 80-S), a shoulder corresponding to complex C (in the 150-S region), and an additional peak of ~400-500-S, that will henceforth be referred to as complex D.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Note that complex D trails into the 750-S region, accounting for the appearance of a small amount of assembly in the simpler analysis presented in Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	388	 However, the detailed analysis presented here makes it clear that in fact there is no discrete peak in the region of completed capsid (750-S).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Thus, the D2 mutant appears to form a series of complexes corresponding in size to the assembly intermediates seen in the pulse-chase experiment (Fig.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	393	 The finding of such complexes would be consistent with the existence of similar transient intermediates in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	394	Cos cells transfected with wild-type Gag were lysed in detergent, and the lysate was analyzed on 13 ml velocity sedimentation gradients, as in Figs.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	396	 The cell lysate contained Pr55 in a spectrum of complexes ranging from 10- to ~200-S.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Since cells efficiently release completed HIV capsids, most of the completed capsid would be expected to be in the medium at steady state.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	398	 This was confirmed by the finding that a substantial amount of fully assembled 750-S capsid was present in the medium (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	399	 7 A, open circles), while the cell lysate contained no 750-S capsids (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	400	 We conclude, therefore, that within cells, Pr55 is present in a heterogeneous mixture of complexes that have S values similar to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates found in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	401	If these complexes correspond to the assembly intermediates seen in the cell-free system, one would expect that different assembly-defective mutants would result in the accumulation of the same sized complexes in cellular systems as they do in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Thus, we examined whether the Pr41 mutant, which appears to be blocked after the first assembly intermediate in the cell-free system, and the D2 mutant, which appears to be blocked at the end of the assembly pathway in the cell-free system, resulted in corresponding patterns of Gag-containing complexes within cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	403	 Cos cells were transfected with each of these mutants, and the medium as well as the lysate were examined by immunoblotting.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	404	 As expected, medium from cells transfected with the assembly-defective Pr41 or D2 did not contain 750-S completed capsids (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	405	 The cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the Pr41 mutant contained only material that peaked in the 10-S region of the velocity gradient (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	406	 7 B), resembling what had been found when the Pr41 mutant was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The observation that the Pr41 reaction product migrated as a single complex that peaked in the 10-S region was confirmed by analysis on a variety of different velocity sedimentation gradients that allowed higher resolution in the 1-200-S size range (data not shown).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	408	 In contrast, the cell lysate of Cos cells transfected with the D2 mutant contained a spectrum of immunoreactive complexes that ranged in size from 10-500-S (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	409	 7 C), resembling what had been found when D2 was expressed in the cell-free system (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Thus, the data from transfected cells suggests that the behavior of Gag mutants in the cell-free system reflects events in capsid assembly that occur in living cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	411	In this paper, we first demonstrate that immature HIV capsids can be assembled in a cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	412	 We establish that the capsids produced closely resemble immature HIV capsids produced in cellular systems (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	413	 1) and that key known features of capsid assembly are faithfully reproduced in this cell-free system (Figs.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	414	 We then use it to dissect assembly into a number of steps.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	415	 First, through the use of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, we demonstrate that assembly can be resolved into a co-translational phase, during which Pr55 polypeptides are synthesized, followed by a posttranslational phase, during which additional events necessary for assembly take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Being able to separate these two phases allows us to analyze reactions specific to the assembly process, independent of other events such as protein synthesis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	417	By manipulating the posttranslational phase of assembly, we then demonstrate that it has at least three specific requirements (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	418	 First, ATP is necessary, since the enzyme apyrase is able to effectively block the posttranslational progression of completed Pr55 chains into fully assembled capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Second, this phase is sensitive to nonionic detergent, implying that membrane fragments are likely to be involved.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Third, using a depletion and reconstitution approach, we demonstrate that a subcellular fraction of eukaryotic cell lysate is required for the posttranslational assembly events to take place.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	421	In addition, multiple criteria are used to demonstrate that the posttranslational phase of assembly proceeds by way of a series of Gag-containing complexes that appear to constitute intermediates in the cell-free capsid assembly reaction (Figs.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Finally, we show that complexes resembling assembly intermediates may also be present in cellular systems that are producing immature HIV particles, and that mutants in Gag have a similar behavior in both cellular and cell-free systems (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	423	Novel Requirements for HIV Capsid Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	424	To date, studies have not revealed whether HIV capsid assembly occurs by way of a passive process of Gag polypeptide multimerization, or whether assembly is an active, regulated process requiring Gag associations with other proteins, as well as Gag-Gag interactions.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	425	 By demonstrating that the posttranslational phase of assembly requires ATP and a detergent-insensitive host cell component, our data indicate that in fact HIV capsid assembly is an energydependent, coordinated process in which host proteins play a crucial role.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Thus, the model of HIV capsid assembly supported by our data is conceptually very different from the view that many viral capsids are formed from capsid monomers by way of a passive process of "self assembly," requiring no components besides the individual capsid protein subunits (Klug, 1980).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Indeed, while host factors have not previously been documented to play a role in the assembly of HIV capsids, the possibility of their existence has been raised by data demonstrating that yeast expressing Gag do not support HIV capsid assembly (Jacobs et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	428	, 1989), while baculovirus and mammalian systems of expression do (for review see Boulanger and Jones, 1996).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Such studies imply that yeast either contain a factor that inhibits HIV capsid assembly (that is absent in higher eukaryotes) or lack a factor necessary for assembly (that is present in higher eukaryotes).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Our data support the latter possibility.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Consistent with the notion that previously unrecognized host factors may be important at various points in the HIV life cycle is the recent demonstration that cyclophilins are associated with the HIV virus particle and are required for infectivity (Luban et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	432	The finding that HIV capsid assembly requires ATP as well as host cell components suggests that the posttranslational phase of assembly may occur via a step-wise pathway of previously unrecognized assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	433	 We present three lines of evidence to support this view.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	434	 First, using a pulse-chase analysis we demonstrate that a population of lower molecular weight Gag-containing complexes, referred to as complexes A, B, and C, is present at early time points in capsid assembly, and that Gag polypeptides from this population are converted into the final capsid product over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	435	 Note that the possibility that these complexes represent polyribosomes has been ruled out by the demonstration that they are not sensitive to RNase A used at concentrations that result in complete digestion of messenger RNA (Lingappa, J.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	436	 At very short chase times, all of the radiolabeled Pr55 in the pulse-chase reaction is present in complex A, suggesting that this may be the first intermediate in the assembly reaction, appearing after completed Gag chains are released from ribosomes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	437	 It remains to be determined whether complex A constitutes either a monomer or dimer of Gag, or whether it is composed of a Gag chain associated with a host protein.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	438	Secondly, we show that by blocking assembly pharmacologically, using either apyrase or detergent, material in two of these complexes (complexes B and C) accumulates, indicating that they are likely to be precursors to the completed 750-S capsid end product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Note that these data do not exclude the existence of other intermediates that might occur later in the pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Such intermediates would not be seen with apyrase or detergent blockade, since these agents appear to block assembly by preventing progression beyond the 150-S complex.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	441	 The demonstration that both detergent and ATP depletion appear to result in the accumulation of the same assembly intermediates raises the possibility that this point in the assembly pathway may be a critical one, in which a variety of events necessary for assembly must take place in a coordinated fashion.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Further work will be required to determine whether this represents an important point of regulation in the assembly pathway.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	443	Finally, the analysis of three different Gag mutants that are known to be assembly defective lends further support to the presence of assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	444	 We find that each mutant results in the accumulation of different subsets of these assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	445	 Thus, a mutant that appears to be blocked after the first step in the assembly pathway results in the accumulation of complex A alone (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	446	 6 C), while one that appears to be blocked after the second step of the pathway results in accumulation of complex A and complex B (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	447	 A spectrum of complexes, including complexes A, B, and C, as well as the larger complex D, is seen upon expression of a mutant that appears to be blocked at a very late step in the assembly pathway (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Thus, analysis of these mutants supports the existence of intermediates in the assembly of HIV capsids, and also suggests an order to the appearance of such intermediates during the process of capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	449	There are a number of caveats to our demonstration of assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	450	 First, one or more of these putative intermediates could in fact constitute a side reaction or dead end byproduct off the main pathway of capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	451	 The most likely candidate for such a dead-end byproduct is complex D, which is only clearly apparent in the analysis of the assembly-defective D2 mutant (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Arguing against the possibility that complexes A, B, or C are simply nonproductive side reactions is the finding that the amount of each of these complexes varies inversely with the amount of completed, immature capsid formed.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	453	 Such behavior would be expected for assembly intermediates but not for dead-end byproducts or side reactions.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	454	 For example, the quantity of each of these complexes decreases over time in the pulse-chase experiment, during a period when completed capsids are appearing and the total number of radiolabeled Gag chains present is constant (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Likewise, complexes B and C increase in quantity when formation of capsids is blocked (Table I).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Additionally, in an analysis of a mutant that is more efficient in capsid production than wild-type cells, we find that the amount of complex A drops to very low levels when very large amounts of capsid are being made (Hill, R.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	457	 Lingappa, unpublished observation).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	458	 Thus, the simplest interpretation of our data is that the Gag complexes A, B, and C constitute true assembly intermediates, although definitive proof of this must await a functional examination of each of these intermediates in isolation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	459	A second caveat is that our analysis could be complicated by instability of Gag-containing complexes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	460	 Thus, lower molecular weight complexes could actually result from disassembly of a higher order complex.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	461	 This seems unlikely to be a significant problem in our system, given that we have not observed any of the Gag-containing complexes to be labile in our studies.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	462	 For example, in the pulse- chase experiments (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	463	 5), there is a clear-cut progression over time from complexes A, B, and C to completed immature capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Residual amounts of complexes A and B present at the end of the incubation are likely due to incomplete conversion resulting from depletion and inactivation of necessary factors over time.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	465	A third caveat that should be noted is that there may exist additional intermediates in HIV capsid assembly that are not obvious from our current analysis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Finally, we wish to point out that the S-values assigned to each of the complexes described here are only approximate S-values, calculated from the migration of these complexes in velocity sedimentation gradients (see Materials and Methods).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	467	 While one or more complexes may not appear to be distinct in a particular experiment or a particular gradient (i.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	468	 5 C), the specific complexes described here have been seen repeatedly in many different experiments and under a variety of gradient conditions and therefore are likely to represent discrete complexes that are difficult to resolve perfectly in every experiment given their transient and dynamic nature.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	470	Together, our results support a model of capsid assembly as a stepwise process consisting of discrete biochemical events with specific requirements for ATP and at least one detergent-insensitive component of eukaryotic cell lysate.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	471	 8 presents the simplest scenario that unifies the data presented here.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	472	 While further analysis of this system may reveal additional complexities, this scheme presents a biochemical framework against which hypotheses can now be tested.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Nascent Gag polypeptides appear to chase into completed immature capsids by way of a series of Gag-containing complexes (complexes A, B, C, and D).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Evidence presented in the text suggests that complexes A, B, and C may constitute assembly intermediates.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	478	 It is less clear whether complex D constitutes an assembly intermediate or a side reaction.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	479	 Both ATP and a subcellular fraction of eukaryotic cell extract are required for assembly to take place, while detergent and apyrase are proposed to disrupt assembly at the indicated position.

0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	482	While intermediates along such a pathway have not been demonstrated previously within cells, this could be a consequence of their transient nature and the difficulties involved in manipulating cellular systems.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	483	 Further work will be required to determine to what extent the mechanism of cell-free HIV capsid assembly reflects biochemical events that occur in vivo.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	484	 Here we show that, under steady state conditions, cells releasing immature HIV capsids contain Pr55 complexes that correspond in approximate size to complexes A, B, and C, the assembly intermediates observed in the cell-free system.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	485	 In addition, assembly-defective mutants arrested at specific complexes in the cell-free system appear to be arrested in the form of similar sized complexes when they are expressed in cells (Fig.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	486	 While these data do not constitute proof that assembly intermediates exist in cells, they lend support to the idea that the process of HIV capsid assembly in the cell-free system is closely correlated to the capsid assembly process in cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	487	 It should be noted that in other biological systems, transient intermediates that have been well documented in cell-free reactions have yet to be identified in cells.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	488	 For example, in the case of targeting of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, signal recognition particle-bound nascent chains have been demonstrated biochemically only in cell-free systems (Walter and Blobel, 1983), even though genetic evidence confirms the importance of signal recognition particles in vivo (Hann and Walter, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	489	A Mechanistic View of HIV Capsid Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	490	In addition to allowing us to identify novel steps in HIV capsid assembly, the cell-free system also allows us mechanistic insights into known aspects of capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	491	 For example, our data suggest that the reason that certain Gag mutants fail to assemble is because they lack domains of the Gag polypeptide that may be required, either directly or indirectly, for progression from one assembly intermediate to the next along the proposed pathway for HIV capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	492	 Similarly, our results indicate that in the absence of the myristate moiety or in the absence of intact membranes, capsid assembly fails to progress beyond specific stages in the assembly process.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	493	Altogether, we demonstrate that capsid assembly can be disrupted at different points in the proposed assembly pathway by five different means: (a) omitting MCoA during the co-translational phase of the reaction, (b) depleting ATP during the posttranslational phase, (c) treating with detergent either at the start of translation or posttranslationally, (d) removing the detergent-insensitive subcellular component(s) from the eukaryotic cell lysate used for the assembly reaction, and (e) programming the reaction with assembly-defective Gag mutants.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	494	 While details of the mechanisms underlying these forms of blockade remain to be determined by further analysis, these data reveal the power of this approach for elucidating the biochemical events that underlie capsid assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	495	Cell-free Assembly of Other Viral Capsids.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	496	Cell-free systems have been used in the past to assemble simple viral particles whose formation is dependent only on cytosolic components of host cells (Molla et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	497	 In the current study we demonstrate that such systems can also be used to reconstitute the assembly of much more complex viral capsids, such as HIV capsids, that require co-translational modifications as well as membrane targeting for their biogenesis.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	498	 These data suggest that the cell-free system can be used to examine capsid assembly mechanisms of many different types of viruses.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	499	Previously, we used a cell-free system to study the mechanism of assembly of a Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), a completely unrelated virus (Lingappa et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	500	 Unlike HIV capsids, HBV capsids are formed free in the cytoplasm of the host cell (for review see Ganem, 1991).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	501	 We found that these capsids assemble by way of an intermediate that is associated with at least one host protein.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	502	 When this intermediate was isolated, manipulation of energy substrates resulted in release of the completed capsid end product.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	503	 Thus, while cell-free HIV and HBV capsid assembly differ greatly in many details and in their complexity, they share some general mechanistic themes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	504	 Capsid formation in both systems involves assembly intermediates, the use of energy substrates, and association with host proteins.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	505	 Thus, we propose that viruses of very different types may assemble their capsids via a step-wise pathway using host cell machinery.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	506	 Whether the same or different host machinery is recruited by various viruses remains to be determined.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	507	Implications of the Cell-free System for Viral Assembly.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	508	To allow an analysis of the earliest events in capsid biogenesis, we designed this cell-free system to assemble the simplest version of an HIV capsid, one that does not undergo maturation and lacks HIV genomic RNA and HIVspecific proteins (except for Gag).
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	509	 Now that the method has been established, it should be possible to supplement this system with such additional components in a manner that will extend the reconstitution and allow the roles of other components in capsid assembly to be determined.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	510	 For example, using a modified version of this system, it should be possible to determine the requirements for encapsidation of viral RNA and viral specific enzymes.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	511	 Note that although no HIV-specific RNA besides the gag transcript is included in the cell-free reactions described in this study, it is entirely possible that nonspecific RNA from the cellular extract becomes incorporated into the capsids that are made.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	512	Recent studies demonstrating the highly dynamic nature of HIV (Ho et al.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	513	, 1995) indicate that the only successful approach to combating this infection will be simultaneous, multi-drug therapy.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	514	 Antiretroviral agents currently in use target only two aspects of the HIV life- cycle, namely reverse transcription and protease-dependent virion maturation.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	515	 In order to develop novel targets for future antiretroviral therapy, a mechanistic analysis of other aspects of the HIV life cycle, such as capsid assembly, must be aggressively pursued.
0.15107806.9024688.html.plaintext.txt	516	 The work presented here establishes a means of carrying out such a biochemical analysis for assembly of the HIV capsid.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We identified a new heterochronic gene, lin-46, from mutations that suppress the precocious phenotypes caused by mutations in the heterochronic genes lin-14 and lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	9	 lin-46 mutants on their own display retarded phenotypes in which cell division patterns are reiterated and differentiation is prevented in certain cell lineages.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Our analysis indicates that lin-46 acts at a step immediately downstream of lin-28, affecting both the regulation of the heterochronic gene pathway and execution of stage-specific developmental events at two stages: the third larval stage and adult.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We also show that lin-46 is required prior to the third stage for normal adult cell fates, suggesting that it acts once to control fates at both stages, and that it affects adult fates through the let-7 branch of the heterochronic pathway.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Interestingly, lin-46 encodes a protein homologous to MoeA of bacteria and the C-terminal domain of mammalian gephyrin, a multifunctional scaffolding protein.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Our findings suggest that the LIN-46 protein acts as a scaffold for a multiprotein assembly that controls developmental timing, and expand the known roles of gephyrin-related proteins to development.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In many cell lineages, cell division patterns and differentiation events differ during each of the four larval stages (L1-L4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A mutation in a heterochronic gene results in either precocious or retarded development in which stage-specific patterns of cell division and differentiation are either skipped or reiterated, respectively.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For example, lin-14 and lin-28 are two heterochronic genes that act early in larval development: lin-14 loss-of-function (lf) mutant animals precociously execute events specific to the second larval stage (L2) and later, and lin-28(lf) animals precociously execute events specific to the third larval stage (L3) and later (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The heterochronic genes are like other developmental regulators in that they define a component of the fate of a cell, but unlike spatial or cell-type regulators, they govern the temporal component of that fate.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	31	  In general, each heterochronic gene governs cell fates at a particular larval stage, and a gene that acts early in larval development may affect later stages as a consequence.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For example, lin-28 is involved immediately in the L2 fate decision, but indirectly affects adult differentiation programs (Ambros, 1989).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In particular, lin-28(lf) causes precocious execution of the larva-to-adult (L/A) switch, during which lateral hypodermal seam cells cease dividing, differentiate, and produce adult alae, a cuticle structure.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	52	  lin-14 has two roles during larval development: first to determine L1 fates only, and then later to affect the L2 and subsequent events (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These two activities differ not only by when they occur, but in the nature of their interactions with other genes.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Specifically, lin-14 apparently acts alone to govern L1 cell fates, then it interacts with lin-28 to choose cell fates that will occur in the L2 (Ambros, 2000).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	55	 lin-14 and lin-28 are engaged in a complex genetic circuitry that involves both positive and negative regulatory interactions (see Fig.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Normally during the L1, L3 and L4 stages, most seam cells undergo a single asymmetric cell division, after which the anterior daughter joins the hypodermal syncytium and the posterior daughter remains a seam cell (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, in the L2 of wild-type animals, the asymmetric division of certain seam cells (V1-4, V6) is preceded by a symmetric division, which increases the number of seam cells on each side of an animal by five; additional seam cells are also added at this stage by descendants of other hypodermal cells (H1 and T; Table 1, line 1; Fig.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	138	 lin-28(lf) animals have fewer seam cells than wild type, because they skip L2 lineage patterns that generate these additional seam cells; lin-28(lf) animals also cease the molting after only three cycles because of precocious execution of the L/A switch (Table 1, line 2; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We found that the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals had the normal number of seam cells at every stage, as well as the normal four molts, indicating suppression of the L2 lineage defects of lin-28(lf) by the lin-46 mutation (Table 1, line 3; Fig.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, surprisingly, one of the lin-46 mutant alleles (ma174) was isolated as a suppressor of lin-14(n179ts) animals.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As mentioned above, lin-14 acts twice during larval development: once to affect L1 cell fates (lin-14A activity), and again to affect L2 and later fates (lin-14B activity) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	149	 When lin-14(n179ts) animals are raised at 25 degrees C they display both a loss of lin-14A activity, causing a precocious increase in seam cell number and a loss of lin-14B activity, which leads to precocious execution of the L/A switch (Table 1, line 5; Table 2, line7).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We found that a mutation in lin-46(lf) suppressed lin-14B defects, but not the lin-14A defects, of the lin-14(n179ts) allele.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Specifically, lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals had an abnormal number of seam cells in the L1, but had the normal number of molts (Table 1, line 6).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Furthermore, compared with lin-14(n179ts) animals, the lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals were significantly less egg-laying defective and showed reduced amounts of precocious adult alae (Table 1, line 6; Table 2, line 8).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Similarly, the precocious adult alae formation of lin-14(n360), a lin-14(lf) allele that displays only lin-14B defects, was suppressed by lin-46(lf) (Table 2, lines 9 and 10) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition, we observed that intestinal nuclei of lin-46(lf); lin-14(n179ts) animals fail to divide in the L1 as they normally do, which is a lin-14A defect, but did not display precocious vulva development, a lin-14B defect (data not shown) (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987; Euling and Ambros, 1996).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Thus, lin-46(lf) suppressed the defects that lin-14 hypomorphic alleles have in common with lin-28(lf), but not those unique to lin-14, although it suppressed none of the defects of a lin-14 null allele.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	156	Interestingly, the suppression of the lin-28(lf) phenotype was quite complete: whereas 100% of lin-28(lf) animals have precocious adult alae, the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) double mutant animals were devoid of adult alae at the L4 stage (Table 2, lines 3 and 4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	157	 By contrast, the suppression of lin-14 hypomorphic alleles was substantial, albeit incomplete.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	158	 For example, for lin-14(n360), the percentage of animals with full-length precocious adult alae was reduced from 77% to 5%; however, 95% of double mutant animals had some amount of precocious alae (Table 2, lines 9 and 10).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	159	Because lin-14 and lin-28 act together to govern the cell fates of the L2 and later, our findings suggest that lin-46 has different relationships with these two genes.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The ability of lin-46(lf) to suppress lin-14 hypomorphic alleles but not a null allele may reflect that at least some lin-14 activity is required for suppression, and, furthermore, that lin-46(lf) suppresses the phenotype of lin-28(lf) by raising lin-14 activity to a compensatory level.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Importantly, a requirement for lin-14 in the suppression would suggest that lin-14 can act independently of lin-28 to control late stage fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Because of its implications for how the heterochronic pathway functions, we further investigated this possibility.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	163	Suppression of lin-28 does not require lin-14 To determine whether lin-14 is indeed required for the suppression of lin-28(lf) phenotype by lin-46(lf), we assessed hypodermal development in strains bearing a null allele of lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	164	 lin-14(0) animals skip L1-specific lineage patterns, and precociously execute the L2-specific division patterns that increase the seam cell number (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	165	 It has been previously shown that a lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) strain executes the L/A switch one stage earlier than a lin-14(0) strain; however, the effect of this mutant combination on seam cell number was not assessed (Ambros, 1989).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	166	 We observed that the increase of 10 to 15 seam cells that occurs abnormally early during the L1 in lin-14(0) animals did not occur in the absence of lin-28, consistent with an L3 lineage pattern occurring two stages early (Table 3, lines 1 and 3).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This observation indicates the hypodermal lineage patterns executed in the L1 in lin-14(0) animals are controlled by lin-28, and is evidence that lin-28 acts independently of lin-14 to govern these cell fate choices.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Suppression of lin-28(0) by lin-46(0) does not require lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	169	  Importantly, although lin-46(lf) had no effect on the number of seam cells of lin-14(0) animals with wild-type lin-28, it increased the number of seam cells of a lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) strain to that of a lin-14(0) strain (Table 3).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Thus, lin-46(lf) suppressed the lin-28(lf) defect, despite the absence of lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In addition, the L/A switch, as indicated by seam cell fusion and adult alae formation, occurred one stage later in triple mutant animals relative to lin-28(lf); lin-14(0) animals (data not shown).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Therefore, the elevation of lin-14 activity is not the mechanism by which lin-46(lf) compensates for the loss of lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	173	Interactions of lin-46 with other heterochronic mutants To further establish the position of lin-46 in the developmental timing pathway, we examined its interactions with other precocious heterochronic mutants.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In addition to lin-14 and lin-28, several other genes have been identified that result in precocious expression of the L/A switch when mutated: lin-41, lin-42 and lin-57 (Z.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For this analysis, we again examined the ability of a lin-46(lf) to suppress the precocious execution of the L/A switch that is characteristic of these mutants.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	177	lin-46(lf) partially suppressed the precocious synthesis of adult alae of a lin-42(lf), whereas it had little or no effect on the precocious alae caused by loss of the activities of lin-41(lf) and lin-57(lf) (Table 2, lines 11-16).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Thus, lin-46 appears to function upstream of lin-41 and lin-57 and downstream or in parallel with lin-42 in controlling the L/A switch.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	179	 These results are consistent with lin-46 acting early in the heterochronic pathway, because both lin-41 and lin-57 are thought to act late in development, downstream of lin-28 in controlling the L/A switch (see Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The earliest time of action of lin-42 has not been determined, but previous genetic analysis, as well as these data, are consistent with it acting early in the heterochronic pathway (Z.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	182	lin-46 mutations cause retarded development at two stages In examining the effects of lin-46(lf) in the absence of other heterochronic mutations, we observed an increase in the number of seam cells after the L2 stage when the animals were grown at 15 degrees C (Table 1, line 8).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This increase probably reflects a reiteration of the L2-specific lineage pattern at the L3 stage, in which the five seam cells that divide twice in the L2, do so again in the L3 (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This retarded lineage defect was not observed when animals were raised at 20 degrees C, indicating a strict cold-sensitivity for this defect (Table 1, line 7).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Because the mutant alleles of lin-46 are likely to result in the complete loss of function of the gene (see below), a reiteration of L2 lineages in lin-46(0) would indicate that the normal role of lin-46 is to promote the expression of L3-specific cell fates at the appropriate time.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	186	Moreover, we observed that two mutant alleles of lin-46 each caused a similar failure of the L/A switch at the end of larval development, resulting in gaps in adult alae (Table 4, lines 4 and 7; Figs 1, 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The penetrance and expressivity of this phenotype are significantly enhanced by growth at low temperature.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	188	 For example, the retarded L/A switch defect of lin-46(ma164) showed 6% penetrance at 25 degrees C, 32% at 20 degrees C, and 86% at 15 degrees C (Table 4, lines 4-6).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Because this cold sensitivity was true of mutant alleles of lin-46, which, as described below, are likely to be null by molecular criteria, it appears to be a property of a strain lacking lin-46 activity, rather than a property of the molecular lesions themselves.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Specifically, 32% of lin-46(ma164) animals raised at 20 degrees C show L/A switch defects, whereas none grown at the same temperature showed reiteration of L2 lineage patterns (Table 1, line 7, and Table 4, line 5).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, the late stage defect is not dependent on an earlier lineage defect (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	200	 As discussed below, this is consistent with lin-46 either acting twice, early and late, or acting at one time and separately affecting two downstream processes that are differently sensitive to its level of activity.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	201	Interestingly, the retarded phenotype of lin-46(lf) is nearly completely suppressed by lin-28(lf).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	202	 For example, the penetrance of the L/A switch defect in lin-28(lf); lin-46(ma164) was 8% at 15 degrees C, which is significantly reduced relative to 86% for lin-46(ma164) alone (Table 4, lines 4 and 13).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Likewise, we observed no early cell lineage defects in the double mutant grown at 15 degrees C (Table 1, line 4; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This mutual suppression of lin-46(lf) and lin-28(lf) suggests that lin-46 is not in a simple linear pathway downstream of lin-28, but rather that their activities converge, possibly on common targets.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	205	By contrast, the retarded phenotype of lin-46(lf) was not suppressed by a lin-14 null mutation.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Rather, lin-46(lf) causes a severe retarded defect in a lin-14 null mutant background (67%), as it does in an otherwise wild-type background (86%; Table 4, lines 4 and 17).

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	251	 We observed that it was sufficient that animals be at the restrictive temperature only until the L2 lethargus for nearly 90% of the population to display gaps in adult alae (Table 5, 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Futhermore, we found it was necessary that the animals be at 15 degrees C at least until L2 lethargus for a high penetrance of the alae defect; if animals were shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature at the L2 lethargus then 7% or less showed the defect (Table 5, 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These data indicate that the period that lin-46 mutant animals are cold sensitive for the adult alae defect is prior to the L3 stage.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Because the early fate defect of lin-46(lf) is executed early in the L3 stage, these observations suggest that lin-46 is required during the L2 stage to affect cell fates executed at both early and late stages.

0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Our genetic results support a model in which lin-46 supports the activity of a downstream complex of factors that promotes specific fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The nature of these factors, whether involved in signaling or gene regulation, is not known, however, some may be direct regulatory targets of lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	260	 lin-46 encodes a novel developmental regulator, a protein that resembles the multifunctional vertebrate protein gephyrin, and therefore may act, like gephyrin, as a scaffold for a multiprotein complex.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	261	Interactions governing the L2/L3 fate choice The heterochronic pathway is characterized by dynamic interactions among regulators that make binary choices in stage-specific cell fates (Ambros, 1989).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We previously presented a model for the interactions governing the choice of L2 versus L3 cell fates (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In this model, lin-14 and lin-28 are repressed by the microRNA lin-4 at the same time they support each other's expression via a lin-4-independent feedback circuit.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	264	 This positive regulatory circuit is proposed to occur by the repression of two negative regulators, x and y, whose identities are not known.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	265	Here we extend this model by proposing that lin-46 acts specifically to promote the activity of y, and furthermore, that y acts both to regulate lin-14 expression and to control developmental timing at two larval stages (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Therefore, y represents both the point of convergence of the lin-28 and lin-46 activities, as well as a branch-point in the pathway that affects lin-14 expression and L3 cell fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	267	 We have no reason yet to believe that lin-14 expression and L3 cell fates are regulated by distinct factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Therefore, we continue to indicate this as a single activity, the hypothetical factor y, which may consist of multiple factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	269	In our model, we have placed lin-46 outside of the feedback circuit based on the relative penetrance of the lin-28(lf) and lin-46(lf) phenotypes and their mutual suppression (Tables 1 and 4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Based on molecular analysis, the alleles of lin-28 and lin-46 used in these experiments are null (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Thus, their mutual suppression implies that lin-28 and lin-46 affect a common process, but do not act in a simple linear pathway.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	272	 If it were a simple pathway, then the lin-28(lf); lin-46(lf) animals would display the same degree of retarded development as lin-46(lf) animals.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Furthermore, the difference in penetrance of the lin-28(lf) and lin-46(lf) phenotypes suggests they have different degrees of influence on cell fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Specifically, whereas a lin-28(lf) is always fully precocious, the lin-46(lf) retarded phenotype is incomplete and conditional.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	275	 For these reasons, we propose that lin-46 is not directly part of the lin-14/lin-28 positive feedback circuit, and therefore is not itself y, but rather acts to promote the activity of y (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	276	The difference in the penetrance between the suppression by lin-46(lf) of lin-28(lf) and the retarded L2 phenotype of lin-46(lf) also suggests that changes occur in how the L2/L3 fate decision is made at different times.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In other words, cell fates at the L2 stage in a lin-28(lf) are more sensitive to the loss of lin-46 than are fates at the L3 in wild type (Table 1; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Perhaps the decision to execute L3 fates is more robust at the third larval stage in wild type because of additional activities that are not present at the second larval stage in a lin-28 mutant.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Furthermore, in no situation does the absence of lin-46 cause L2-specific cell fates to be reiterated indefinitely, further suggesting that additional factors come to influence the L2/L3 fate decision, ultimately in favor of L3 fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	280	The role of lin-14 in late stage cell fates Our observations help to further illuminate the relationship between lin-14 and lin-28 in controlling the execution of cell fates after the first larval stage.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Two models have been proposed to explain the activities of lin-14, lin-14A and lin-14B that independently affect L1 and later developmental events (Ambros and Horvitz, 1987).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	282	 One is that different isoforms of the LIN-14 protein possess these distinct activities (Wightman et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	283	, 1991; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, this model is not supported by the finding that a molecular clone of a single isoform of LIN-14 can fully rescue lin-14(lf) (Hong et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	285	 A second model is that the LIN-14 protein forms a temporal gradient through larval development, analogous to morphogen gradients in the Drosophila embryo (Ruvkun and Giusto, 1989; Reinhart and Ruvkun, 2001).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	286	 However, our findings indicate that lin-14 affects L2 developmental events only through lin-28, which requires a genetic circuit between these genes that engages late in the first larval stage (Table 3) (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In other words, the lin-14B activity essentially reflects the participation of lin-14 in a positive feedback circuit with lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	288	This model explains why lin-46(lf), which bypasses the requirement for lin-28, suppresses the L2 defects of lin-14(lf) but not its L1 defects.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Hypomorphic alleles of lin-14, such as lin-14(n360) and lin-14(n179ts) used in these studies, reduce the activity of lin-14, but do not eliminate it.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	290	 At the end of the first larval stage, when the positive feedback circuit between lin-14 and lin-28 is engaged, a mutation in lin-14 would lead to a reduction in lin-28 expression, and then a further reduction in lin-14.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	291	 We have previously proposed that y in our model mediates the reduction of lin-14 in this circuit (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, if lin-46 is absent, the activity of y would be attenuated and the reduction of lin-14 would not be further amplified.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Therefore, lin-46(lf) suppresses a lin-14 hypomorph by essentially upregulating the existing lin-14 activity.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	294	 As a corollary, we propose that part of the reduction of lin-14 activity of hypomorphic alleles is due to further downregulation via the positive feedback circuit.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	295	Importantly, the reason a lin-46 mutation does not suppress a lin-14 null allele is twofold: first, lin-14 normally acts through the feedback circuit and lin-28 to control the L2/L3 fate choice, as we have shown (Table 3); and second, the lin-28-repressive component of the feedback circuit is not engaged early in the first larval stage of a lin-14 mutant, as has been shown previously (Seggerson et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Therefore, the effects of lin-28 and lin-46 on the L2/L3 fate decision are independent of the feedback circuit because they occur in the early L1 when lin-14 is absent.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Supporting this conclusion is our observation that lin-46(lf) causes a severe retarded phenotype in a lin-14(0) background at 15 degrees C (Table 4).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Thus, the different genetic interactions lin-46 has with lin-14 and lin-28 reflect the underlying change in the relationship between lin-14 and lin-28 that occurs at the end of the L1 stage with the engagement of the lin-4-independent feedback circuit (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	299	lin-46 affects L3 and adult fates independently Our data also indicate that the role of lin-46 in regulating the L/A switch appears to be independent of its role in the L2/L3 fate decision.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Specifically, lin-46(lf) animals grown at 20 degrees C display normal cell lineage patterns early, but at the same temperature there is significant failure of the L/A switch at the L4 stage (Tables 1 and 4; Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Thus, the failure of the L/A switch in lin-46(lf) animals can occur without a prior lineage defect.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Because lin-46:GFP reporters are expressed in the L4 stage (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	303	 4B), this independence of early and late retarded defects may reflect that lin-46 acts twice, once to promote L3 fates and again later to promote adult-specific fates.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, we found that the cold-sensitive period of lin-46(lf) strain for the adult fates is prior to the L3 stage.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	305	 This finding suggests that lin-46 normally acts only once at a branch-point in the heterochronic pathway where some of its targets influence L3 fates immediately, and other targets, which are more sensitive to its absence, govern adult fates (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	306	 This latter possibility is consistent with lin-46 acting at a step immediately downstream of lin-28.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	307	 In our model, therefore, y may represent multiple factors, some of which affect the L2/L3 fate decision and the regulation of lin-14, and others which affect the L/A switch through the other known heterochronic genes (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	308	 One possibility is that lin-28 and lin-46 directly affect the microRNA let-7, which then regulates other genes that control the L/A switch (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This is consistent with the failure of lin-46(lf) to suppress the precocious phenotypes of the later-acting genes lin-41 and lin-57 (Table 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Further analysis will determine whether lin-46 and lin-28 indeed affect the expression or activity of let-7.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Because let-7 or let-7-like microRNAs have been hypothesized to regulate lin-14, it is an intriguing possibility that some of factors that constitute y are microRNAs.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	312	LIN-46 may form a scaffold for a multiprotein assembly The homology of the LIN-46 protein to MoeA and gephyrin further provides a basis for explaining its function.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	313	 The crystal structure of MoeA shows it to exist as a homodimer, and it is likely that proteins with sequence similarity to MoeA do so as well (Schrag et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	314	 We have observed that the LIN-46 protein strongly interacts with itself in a yeast two hybrid assay, further suggesting LIN-46 forms multimers (L.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Gephyrin is believed to dimerize with itself via its C-terminal MoeA-like region, and trimerize with its N-terminal MogA-like region (see Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	316	 The ability of gephyrin to multimerize and form a scaffold is the basis for its ability to cluster and aid the activity of interacting proteins (Schwarz et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Although gephyrin is known to act both in synaptic transmission and in molybdenum co-factor biosynthesis, LIN-46 does not appear to have a role in either of these processes in C.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	318	 elegans; possibly its paralog, MOC-1, has these roles.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	319	 We speculate that a general feature of proteins related to gephyrin, therefore, may be their ability to form scaffolds that avail them to participating in diverse biological roles, including development.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	320	Based on several lines of evidence, including the homology to gephyrin, we propose a molecular model for LIN-46 in which it acts as a scaffolding protein for a multiprotein complex that determines cell fates (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Supporting this model is the striking cold sensitivity of lin-46 null alleles (Table 2).
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Cold sensitivity can be a feature of mutations affecting the dynamics of multiprotein structures, such as microtubules and bacteriophage capsids (Huffaker et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	323	 LIN-46 may potentiate the activity of a complex that includes cell fate regulators or other developmental timing factors.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	324	 LIN-46 is not essential for the activity of this complex, because development of a lin-46 null mutant is nearly normal at 20 degrees C, but the absence of LIN-46 protein may substantially reduce the activity of the complex at low temperature, possibly by causing the retention of a negative regulator of the complex.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Because the LIN-28 protein appears to be a specific mRNA-binding protein (Moss et al.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	326	, 1997), the expression of some of the components of the complex may be repressed when lin-28 is normally active (Fig.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The suppression of the loss of lin-28 activity would therefore result from balance between the overexpression of components of the complex, and reduced efficiency of their function.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	328	In summary, we believe lin-46 occupies a unique position in the heterochronic pathway and furthers our understanding of the complex genetic network that governs the temporal regulation of developmental events.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The fact that the LIN-46 protein resembles gephyrin expands the biological function of this protein family to development.
0.19757515.15073154.html.plaintext.txt	330	 LIN-46 is likely to interact with other proteins in controlling cell fate choices, and the identities of these proteins, which may also be regulatory targets of LIN-28, will provide further insight into how the temporal components of cell fates are determined.

0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	116	J54 binding can be eliminated from HPV-6 without affecting the binding of the type-specific mAbs and it can be transferred into CRPV VLPs without reconstituting the epitopes for the other antibodies.
0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	117	 This suggests that alteration of epitope structure can be significant in impact, yet highly localized in effect.
0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This has important implications for HPV serology.
0.25392318.12771418.html.plaintext.txt	119	 If cross-reactive responses between two closely related HPV types, for example types 16 and 31 or 18 and 45, hinder precise serological evaluation, hybrid VLPs can be made in which the cross-reactive responses are reduced or eliminated, thus creating serological typing reagents with improved sensitivity and selectivity.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In plants, a novel mechanism for cell-to-cell communication involves the intercellular trafficking of regulatory proteins and mRNAs.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The maize KNOTTED1 (KN1) gene acts non cell-autonomously in the maize leaf, and KN1 was the first plant protein shown to traffic cell-to-cell, presumably through plasmodesmata.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We have compared the intercellular trafficking of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of KN1 and Arabidopsis KN1-related homeobox proteins to that of the viral movement protein from turnip vein clearing tobamovirus.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We show that there is specific developmental regulation of GFPKN1 trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	8	 GFPKN1 was able to traffic from the inner layers of the leaf to the epidermis, but not in the opposite direction, from epidermis to mesophyll.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, GFP or the GFPmovement protein fusion moved readily out of the epidermis.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	10	 GFPKN1 was however able to traffic out of the epidermal (L1) layer in the shoot apical meristem, indicating that KN1 movement out of the L1 was developmentally regulated.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	11	 GFPKNAT1/BREVIPEDICELLUS and GFPSHOOTMERISTEMLESS fusions could also traffic from the L1 to the L2/L3 layers of the meristem.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In a test for the functional significance of trafficking, we showed that L1-specific expression of KN1 or of KNAT1 was able to partially complement the strong shootmeristemless-11 (stm-11) mutant.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, a cell-autonomous GUS fusion to KN1 showed neither trafficking ability nor complementation of stm-11 when expressed in the L1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results suggest that the activity of KN1 and related homeobox proteins is maintained following intercellular trafficking, and that trafficking may be required for their normal developmental function.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In the last few years, the intercellular trafficking of regulatory proteins and mRNAs has emerged as a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell communication in plant development (Ding, 1998; Zambryski and Crawford, 2000; Jackson, 2001; Haywood et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Many studies on trafficking of macromolecules relate to virus infection, as some plant viruses move from cell to cell through plasmodesmata (PD).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, the smallest viruses or viral nucleic acids are estimated to be larger than the channel size of PDs (Ding et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 1992b), and viruses traffic via an active pathway that requires virus encoded movement proteins (MPs) (Gibbs, 1976; Wang et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	20	 For example, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) encodes a 30 kDa MP that interacts with PDs to increase their size exclusion limit (SEL), traffics itself and facilitates spread of the virus (Deom et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The observation of viral MP trafficking prompted speculation that endogenous macromolecules might also traffic through PD (Lucas and Wolf, 1993; Lucas et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	22	The use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) greatly facilitated the development of in vivo trafficking assays.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Tissue-specific GFP expression studies also revealed dynamic regulation of PD SEL.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Estimates for PD SEL in mesophyll or trichome cells of mature leaves have been obtained from microinjection experiments, and range from one to a few kDa (Wolf et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	25	, 1989; Waigmann and Zambryski, 1995).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, in immature sink tissues the observation of GFP diffusion suggests that the PD SEL may be as high as 30-50 kDa in these tissues (Imlau et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Developmental changes in GFP diffusion are correlated with changes in PD structure during leaf development, from simple linear channels to complex branched forms (Oparka et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	28	 It is also evident that GFP can diffuse cell-to-cell in some mature tissues, depending on the tissue type and species (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000; Itaya et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Developmental modifications to PDs are also relevant to MP localization and trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, TMV or cucumber mosaic virus MP has been shown to be targeted to plasmodesmata and trafficked between cells only when the leaf reached a certain developmental stage (Ding et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These observations of GFP diffusion and MP trafficking reveal developmental regulation of PD function, suggesting that signaling through PDs is important in plant development.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The idea that MP trafficking is related to that of endogenous proteins is also supported by the fact that trafficking is extremely rapid (Ding, 1998), and that a plant MP-related protein, CmPP16, can traffic itself and mRNA through PDs (Xoconostle-Cazares et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, the extent to which trafficking of endogenous proteins is developmentally regulated is unclear.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Endogenous trafficking proteins include phloem proteins (Balachandran et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	35	, 1997) as well as several developmental transcription factors such as LEAFY (LFY), SHORTROOT (SHR) and KNOTTED1 (KN1).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The LFY meristem identity protein acts non-autonomously and is able to traffic from the L1 layer to the L2 and L3 meristem cells and to complement a lfy mutant (Sessions et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In the root, the SHR protein traffics from the stele into the endodermal cell layer, and trafficking appears to be required for its function in cell fate specification (Nakajima et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The influence of tissue-specific or developmental signals in trafficking of these proteins is largely unknown.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	39	The first endogenous protein shown to traffic cell-to-cell was the maize homeodomain protein, KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Mosaic analysis of a dominant Kn1 allele showed that it acts non-autonomously during maize leaf development (Hake and Freeling, 1986).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Later, in situ hybridization and immunolocalization experiments showed that KN1 protein is detected outside the domain of mRNA expression, suggesting the possibility of KN1 trafficking (Jackson et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Microinjection studies of fluorescently labeled KN1 protein showed directly that KN1 has the ability to traffic between mesophyll cells, to increase PD SEL and to specifically transport its mRNA (Lucas et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These studies suggested that the KN1 protein itself could be the cell non-autonomous signal, and in support of this hypothesis we showed that a GFP-tagged KN1 fusion is able to traffic in the leaf and shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Arabidopsis encodes four class I KN1-related homeobox (KNOX) genes (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The most closely related to KN1 are KNOTTED 1-like homeobox protein 1/BREVIPEDICELLUS (KNAT1/BP) and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM); KNAT1 is thought to be the Arabidopsis ortholog of KN1 (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	46	, 2000), but STM has closer functional similarity to KN1 on the basis of similar null mutant phenotypes and expression patterns (Long et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	47	 STM and KN1 function in SAM initiation and/or maintenance, and KNAT1/BP is involved in the regulation of inflorescence architecture (Byrne et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The possible involvement of trafficking in the function of the Arabidopsis KNOX proteins has not been investigated.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	49	In this report we show a specific difference in inter-layer trafficking in the Arabidopsis leaf between GFPMP and GFPKN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Our observations suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the trafficking of these proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	51	 We also show that GFPKN1 trafficking is under tissue-specific regulation and can be influenced by developmental stage.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In support of a biological function of KNOX protein trafficking, KN1 and the related Arabidopsis proteins STM and KNAT1 could traffic out of the L1 layer of the shoot apical meristem, and movement was correlated with the complementation of stm-11 mutant phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Based on these findings, we discuss the potential roles for trafficking of KNOX gene products during development.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In practical terms for trafficking assays, pRbcS2b serves as a mesophyll-specific promoter, because the guard cells are symplastically isolated from other epidermal cells from an early stage of development (Wille and Lucas, 1984; Ding et al.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	165	, 1992), suggesting that the epidermal GFP fluorescence in these lines represented the intact GFPKN1 fusion protein and not a free GFP degradation product.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This observation of GFPKN1 trafficking was consistent with results using an enhancer trap line to express this fusion in perivascular cells (Kim et al.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	168	GFPKN1 did not traffic out of the epidermis of leaf primordia or of fully expanded leaves GFPKN1 could traffic in the leaf from the mesophyll to epidermal cell layer, where it accumulated in nuclei and in punctate cell wall spots.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	169	 To investigate whether trafficking could also occur in the opposite direction, from epidermis to mesophyll, we expressed GFPKN1 and the other fusion proteins in the epidermal layer of the shoot using the pLTP1 and pAtML1 GAL4 drivers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In leaves and hypocotyls, the pLTP1 and pAtML1 GAL4 drivers induced mGFP5-ER expression specifically in epidermal cells, with no green fluorescence over background levels detected in any other tissues of the shoot (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	171	We next imaged fluorescence of GFPKN1 under the control of the same L1-specific GAL4 drivers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	172	 GFPKN1 fluorescence was restricted to the epidermal tissues of the mature leaf and hypocotyl, and we did not detect any movement to mesophyll cells (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, in contrast to the result from mesophyll-specific expression, when expressed specifically in epidermal cells, GFPKN1 was unable to traffic into cells in the adjacent cell layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	174	To determine whether the absence of trafficking of GFPKN1 out of epidermal cells also occurred in the early stages of leaf development, we imaged GFP fluorescence from young leaf primordia approximately 2 mm long.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	180	To test whether the restriction of protein trafficking out of epidermal cells was a general phenomenon, we expressed free GFP and GFPTVCV MP using the L1-specific GAL4 drivers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Previous reports (Oparka et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	182	, 1999) and our unpublished results suggested that free GFP could move freely from epidermal to mesophyll cells in bombardment assays, and we observed similar results in stable transgenic lines (Fig.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In these cases, the green fluorescence intensity in mesophyll and vascular tissues was approximately equal to that in epidermal cells, suggesting that GFP and GFPTVCV MP moved readily from epidermal to mesophyll cells.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Therefore, the PDs between epidermal and mesophyll cells were open to both non-selective and selective movement.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Since we saw a high level of GFP fluorescence from the GFPTVCV MP fusion in mesophyll and vascular tissues of the shoot, we investigated how far GFPTVCV MP could traffic in the plant, by imaging roots of pAtML1-GFPTVCV MP plants.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	188	 AtML1 mRNA is not detectable in the root (Lu et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	189	, 1996), and mGFP5-ER expression was not detected in the mature region of pAtML1-mGFP5-ER roots (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	190	 However in seedlings carrying the UAS-GFPTVCV MP construct, green fluorescence was detected in vascular and cortical tissue throughout the length of the root (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	191	 3L, lower panel), indicating that MP trafficking occurred over a long distance from the shoot epidermis into the root, presumably through the phloem.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	193	, 1996), it is possible that RNA trafficking is responsible for some of the non autonomous effects.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	194	In summary, whereas GFPKN1 could traffic freely from mesophyll to epidermal cells, it could not traffic in the opposite direction.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The epidermal/mesophyll interface was not blocked to either free diffusion-mediated or selective movement, since both free GFP and GFPTVCV MP moved readily from epidermis to mesophyll and vascular tissues.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	196	GFP fusions to KN1, STM and KNAT1 trafficked out of the epidermal (L1) layer in the shoot apical meristem.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	197	To investigate whether the restriction of trafficking of GFPKN1 out of the epidermal layer occurred throughout all stages of shoot development, we imaged the SAM of pAtML1-GFPKN1 plants.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The nuclear accumulation of the GFP-tagged protein was less evident in the two-photon image than in the confocal image because the two-photon microscope collects light from a narrower Z-section (1  microm).

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	252	 5B, arrow), suggesting that GFPKN1 was trafficking from the peripheral to central region.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	253	To determine whether stm-11 mutants were complemented by KN1 or GFPKN1, we genotyped the transgenic plants using a CAPS assay (A.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We observed shoot rescue in stm-11 homozygotes carrying the pSTM-GFPKN1 transgene, and a representative plant is shown in Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Similar rescue phenotypes were observed in 50% of the independent transgenic lines (4 lines total).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The complemented plants showed relatively normal phyllotaxy, leaf and flower morphology (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	258	 5C, inset), but were shorter, had additional axillary shoots and were sterile.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In contrast, transgenic lines carrying pSTM-KN1 showed full complementation of stm-11 (not shown), including normal stature, flower morphology and fertile seeds.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Therefore KN1 could fully complement stm when expressed from the STM promoter, and the fusion of GFP to KN1 slightly impaired its function.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	261	To address whether KN1 expression in the L1 and its subsequent trafficking into L2 and L3 layers was sufficient to rescue stm, we next transformed stm-11 heterozygotes with the pAtML1-GFPKN1 construct.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In the T1 generation 21/32 (66%) of the stm-11 homozygotes showed partial complementation of the stm-11 phenotype (Fig.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Therefore, the L1 expression of GFPKN1 gave partial complementation of stm-11 that was less complete than the complementation we observed using with pSTM-GFPKN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	266	 To identify whether the partial complementation by L1 expression of GFPKN1 was because of the GFP fusion to KN1, we also transformed stm-11 heterozygotes with a pAtML1-KN1 construct.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	271	Since STM and KNAT1 could also traffic out of the L1, we determined whether L1 expression of these proteins could complement stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Plants expressing STM or GFPSTM from pAtML1 showed a very severe phenotype of stunted growth, small lobed leaves, no cauline leaves and flowers defective in sepal, petal and stamen development (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This phenotypes was presumably partly due to ectopic expression of STM in the leaves and floral organs.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	275	 These bushy plants were homozygous stm-11 (not shown), suggesting therefore partial complementation by the L1-specific expression of STM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	276	 L1 expression of KNAT1 also resulted in partial complementation, as about 30% (7 /24) of T1 plants expressing GFPKNAT1 in the L1 showed partial rescue of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The stm-11/pAtML1-GFPKNAT1 seedlings developed rosette shoots (Fig.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	279	In summary, L1 expression of KN1, STM or KNAT1 was sufficient to give partial rescue of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	280	 We assume that this rescue is in part due to KNOX protein that traffics into the L2 and L3 layers of the SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The partial complementation of stm-11 by KNAT1 expression agrees with previous findings that KNAT1 has a partially redundant function with STM (Byrne et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	282	To test if KN1 trafficking was essential for complementation of stm-11 in this assay, we made a non-trafficking GUSKN1 fusion.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We fused GUS (68 kDa) at the N terminus of KN1, with an intervening alanine linker, as previous studies showed this to be the optimal configuration for KN1 fusions (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The GUSKN1 fusion protein behaved cell-autonomously in the leaf, as GUS activity was detected only in the perivascular cells in J2111/UAS-GUSKN1 lines (Fig.

0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The GUSKN1 fusion was also cell-autonomous in the SAM, as pAtML1-GUSKN1 plants showed GUS activity only in the L1 layer (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	287	We next asked if the L1 restricted expression of GUSKN1 could rescue stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	288	 We observed no rescue of the stm-11 phenotype in 16 independent T1 stm-11 seedlings and in more than 200 stm-11 seedlings from 4 independent T2 lines that expressed GUSKN1 strongly in the L1 (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	289	 This failure to complement could be because GUSKN1 was unable to traffic into L2 and L3 layers, or because the GUS fusion blocked KN1 function independently of its inhibition of KN1 trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	290	 To distinguish these possibilities, we asked if expression of GUSKN1 in all cell layers of the SAM was sufficient to rescue stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	291	 To this end, a 35S-GUSKN1 construct was transformed into stm-11 heterozygotes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	292	 As expected, the transgenic plants showed constitutive GUS activity in all SAM layers (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	293	 We confirmed GUSKN1 over-expression by western blotting using the anti-KN1 antibody (Smith et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	294	 We observed shoot rescue in five out of 15 independent T2 lines (33%) that segregated for stm-11, indicating that the GUSKN1 fusion was indeed functional in this shoot rescue assay (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	295	 The rescue phenotypes were generally weaker than those of the GFPKN1 lines, though some of the 35S-GUSKN1-rescued seedlings developed inflorescence shoots, similar to the stm-11 plants rescued by L1-specific expression of KNOX proteins (not shown).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Therefore, GUSKN1 expression in all SAM layers could partially complement stm-11, whereas L1-specific expression gave no such complementation.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	297	We previously showed that 35S-GFPKN1 plants develop KNOX over-expression phenotypes (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	298	 To our surprise, the 35S-GUSKN1 transgenic plants ( > 40) that were wild type for stm did not show any KN1 over-expression phenotypes (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	299	 5P), despite having strong expression of GUSKN1 throughout the leaves (Fig.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	300	In summary, GUSKN1 was cell-autonomous and partially complemented stm-11 if expressed in all meristem layers, but not when expressed specifically in the L1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	301	 These data support the hypothesis that trafficking out of the L1 is required for shoot rescue in the pAtML1-KNOX expression lines.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Over-expression of the GUSKN1 fusion did not produce KNOX over-expression phenotypes, suggesting either that the over-expression phenotypes require the trafficking function of KN1, or that the GUS fusion interrupts some other function of KN1 involved specifically in generating over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	303	   DISCUSSION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The intercellular trafficking of regulatory proteins likely transmits important developmental signals in plants.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Protein trafficking is thought to occur through plasmodesmata, and if developmentally significant, should be under strict temporal and/or tissue-specific control.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Developmental modifications in PDs do indeed affect free GFP diffusion and selective MP trafficking (Itaya et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	306	, 1999), however almost nothing is known about whether and how regulation occurs for plant proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Here we showed that KN1 trafficking is not only under developmental control but also that KNOX protein trafficking regulates the fate of target cells in the meristem, indicating that the trafficking of homeodomain proteins has potential developmental significance.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	308	Developmental and tissue-specific control of KN1 trafficking In plants with simple leaves, KNOX genes are usually expressed only in the SAM, though developmental consequences of ectopic leaf expression and the expression of KNOX genes in compound leaves indicate that they can function during leaf development (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	309	 We found that GFPKN1 trafficking was regulated tissue-specifically in the leaf.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Whereas it could traffic from mesophyll to epidermis, trafficking did not occur from epidermis to mesophyll, in either leaf primordia or in fully expanded leaves.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Consistent with these observations, distinctive phenotypes arose from layer-specific expression of KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	312	 As expected, the mesophyll-specific expression of GFPKN1 resulted in strong KNOX over-expression phenotypes, similar to constitutive (35S promoter driven) expression (Lincoln et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	313	 However, epidermal-specific expression of GFPKN1 produced a relatively mild, rumpled phenotype.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	314	 This mild phenotype is probably due to the restriction of KN1 in the epidermis, though the fact that epidermal expression is able to alter leaf shape does indicate a non autonomous effect of KN1 that is presumably not due to trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Similar unidirectional signaling was observed in periclinal chimeras of the floral organ identity genes GLOBOSA (GLO) and DEFICIENS (DEF) in Antirrhinum.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Some effects of DEF and GLO expression were non cell-autonomous, however these effects were only partially explained by movement, as DEF also moves from L2 to L1 but not in the opposite direction (Perbal et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In this study we showed that the lack of protein movement out of the epidermis was not, however, a general phenomenon.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Both GFP and GFPTVCV MP moved freely from epidermis to mesophyll, demonstrating that the PDs between epidermal and mesophyll cells are open to both diffusion-mediated and selective protein movement.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	319	Uni-directional trafficking of KN1 in the leaf suggests that KN1 normally traffics from inner to outer layers, and may reveal a directional signaling pathway.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Although class I KNOX genes are not normally expressed in the simple leaves of maize, rice and Arabidopsis, they are expressed in compound leaves (Bharathan et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	321	 For example, LeT6 is expressed in tomato leaf primordia as well as in the SAM (Chen et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	322	 showed that LeT6 mRNA expression was strong in the L2/L3 layers and reduced or absent from the L1 layer of the SAM, and we note that this expression pattern continues in the young leaf primordia (Chen et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	323	 It would be interesting therefore to test whether KNOX proteins traffic directionally in the tomato compound leaf; such a process could provide a mechanism for regulation of leaf morphology by signaling from inner to outer layers during development.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Classic studies involving inter-specific periclinal leaf chimeras indeed indicate the potential for direction signaling during leaf morphogenesis (reviewed by Tilney-Bassett, 1986).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	325	In support of the hypothesis that KN1 traffics through PDs, it showed a punctate pattern resembling that seen with GFPMP, which has been linked with plasmodesmata in studies using electron microscope level immunolocalization (Ding et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Our results imply, however, that the mechanism of KN1 trafficking differs from that of the viral MP.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	327	 This could be because tissue-specific receptors that recognize distinct trafficking motifs in the different proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	328	 This idea is supported by the recent report that non-cell-autonomous pathway protein (NCAPP1), a putative PD receptor, interacts with CmPP16 and TMV MP but not with KN1 (Lee et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Alternatively, tissue-specific post-translational modification(s) of KN1 might affect its ability to traffic.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	330	 For example, phosphorylation regulates the trafficking of TMV MP (Citovsky et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	331	, 2000), and perhaps a similar mechanism controls KN1 trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	332	KN1 and related Arabidopsis KNOX proteins STM and KNAT1 traffic in the SAM Whereas KN1 was unable to traffic from epidermal to mesophyll cells in the leaf, it could traffic from epidermal (L1) cells to underlying cells in the inflorescence SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Two Arabidopsis homologs of KN1, KNAT1 and STM, could also traffic in the SAM, suggesting that hypothetical signal(s) for trafficking in KN1 are conserved in other KNOX proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	334	 These signal(s) could be made up of a simple, short sequence and/or complex structural motif(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	335	 So far, studies using viral MPs and rice phloem proteins suggest that recognition by the PD trafficking machinery involves structural motifs (Haywood et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	336	, 1998), though a short sequence motif appears to control the trafficking of the heat shock cognate 70 chaperone (Aoki et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	337	 In the case of KN1, a short peptide, homologous to a region near the N terminus of the protein, can interfere with its trafficking, though it is not known whether this sequence motif is sufficient for trafficking (Kragler et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	338	We observed a relatively short range of GFPKNOX protein trafficking in the Arabidopsis SAM, which generated a steep gradient of GFP fluorescence spanning approximately 23 cell layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	339	 In contrast, GFPKN1 can traffic over at least 3-5 cell layers in the leaf (Kim et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	340	 GFPTVCV MP or free GFP moved further than GFPKNOX in the SAM, through more than six cell layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	341	 This suggests that KNOX protein trafficking in the meristem is relatively restricted, and may be used for short range signaling.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The more pronounced nuclear localization of GFPKN1 in the meristem than in the leaf may be the cause of its shorter range of trafficking, as nuclear localization probably restricts its chance to interact with PD.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	343	 A similar mechanism was proposed for the restriction of SHR trafficking (Nakajima et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	344	, 2001) and of GFP diffusion (Crawford and Zambryski, 2000).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	345	 In the maize shoot apex, a KN1 protein gradient is also evident between the SAM and leaf primordia (Jackson, 2002).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Although the biological significance of these KNOX protein gradients is not yet clear, it is possible that they are used to activate target genes at different positions along the gradient (Jackson, 2002).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	347	Caution is required in interpreting the trafficking of GFP fusion proteins.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	348	 The GFP tag increases the size of the protein and may affect trafficking efficiency.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	349	 However, the GFPKN1 fusion used in this study produced normal KN1 overexpression phenotypes and also complemented the stm mutation, suggesting it retained normal biological function(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	350	 In addition, the low quantum yield for GFP, relative to other fluorophores, may well result in a significant underestimation of the range over which the tagged protein can traffic.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	351	Biological function of KNOX homeodomain protein trafficking The critical question is what, if any, is the function of KNOX protein trafficking in intercellular signaling? The conservation of trafficking ability in KNOX proteins of different species suggests that their function requires trafficking, and the nuclear localization of GFPKNOX proteins following trafficking in the SAM suggests that they can function in transcription in target cells.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Cell-to-cell trafficking of KNAT1 could explain the non cell-autonomous regulation of epidermal cell fate by KNAT1, reported by Venglat et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	353	GFPKNOX expression in the L1 rescued shoot formation in stm-11 mutants, and trafficking was probably required for this rescue, because the cell-autonomous GUSKN1 fusion did not result in rescue.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Whereas this failure to rescue could be because GUSKN1 was inactive, this was not the case since it could partially rescue stm-11 when expressed in all meristem cell layers using the 35S promoter.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	355	 However, the rescue of stm-11 by 35S-GUSKN1 was only partial, and we speculate that full KN1 function in the SAM might require its intercellular trafficking.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	356	 A functional requirement for KN1 trafficking in the wild-type situation remains to be tested by determining if expression of the non-trafficking version of KN1 under a faithful STM promoter can complement the stm mutant.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	357	Our results suggest that the correct spatial and temporal expression pattern and/or level of KN1/STM in the SAM is required for full complementation of stm-11.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	358	 In contrast to the AtML1 promoter, use of the STM promoter resulted in GFPKN1 expression at a relatively homogeneous level in the different SAM layers.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	359	 These expression differences are probably the reason why the two constructs resulted in different complementation phenotypes; pAtML1-GFPKN1 (or KN1) expression always resulted in partial complementation of stm and abnormal phyllotaxy, while complementation using pSTM-GFPKN1 (or KN1) was more complete and produced seedlings with normal phyllotaxy.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	360	 In this regard, intercellular protein trafficking might provide a way to regulate the distribution and concentration of key developmental regulators across a cellular domain like the SAM.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Intercellular KN1/STM trafficking may be a redundant `fail-safe' mechanism to ensure all cells adopt the SAM fate, analogous to the mechanism originally proposed by Mezitt and Lucas (Mezitt and Lucas, 1996) for non-autonomous action of FLORICAULA, and supported by the demonstration of LFY trafficking (Sessions et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	362	Plants expressing the non-trafficking 35S-GUSKN1 fusion did not have the usual KN1 over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	363	 We therefore hypothesize that KN1 trafficking might be required to generate the over-expression phenotypes, or that movement per-se is important for function, rather than simply which cells contain KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	364	 One possible mechanism would be if KN1 was modified and gained a novel function during intercellular movement.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Partial unfolding of KN1 is required for passage through PDs (Kragler et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	366	, 1998), and could expose KN1 to post-translational modification(s).
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Alternatively, the lack of a KNOX overexpression phenotype in the 35S-GUSKN1 plants could be because the fusion of GUS inhibits the ability KN1 to interact with partner proteins, such as Arabidopsis homologs of KN1 interacting protein (KIP), a BEL1-like TALE homeodomain protein (Smith et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Such interacting proteins may be differentially expressed or differentially required for the over-expression and SAM functions of KN1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Lastly, the nuclear localization of STM is required for its activity (Gallois et al.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	370	, 2002), and if the fusion of GUS interfered with KN1 nuclear localization specifically in the leaf this could also affect its ability to generate over-expression phenotypes.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	371	In conclusion, KN1 trafficking is under temporal and tissue-specific developmental control, and trafficking ability is conserved in STM and KNAT1.
0.15854263.12900451.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Our results suggest that trafficking of KNOX homeodomain proteins is functionally significant, and may coordinate the development of source and target cells, or provide a redundant `fail-safe' mechanism to control the fate of cells in the SAM.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	4	Viruses that replicate in the nucleus, including the primary causative agent of cervical cancer, human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), must first cross the cytoplasm.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We compared the uptake of HPV16 virus-like particles (VLPs) either with or without the minor capsid protein L2.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Whereas VLPs containing only the major capsid protein L1 were diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm even 6 h post-infection, VLPs comprising both L1 and L2 exhibited a radial distribution in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region of BPHE-1 cells within 2 h.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	7	 L2 of HPV16 or bovine papillomavirus was shown to bind to a 43-kDa cellular protein that was subsequently identified as -actin by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A conserved domain comprising residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 was sufficient for interaction with -actin.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	9	 HPV16 L2 residues 25-45 fused to green fluorescent protein, but not green fluorescent protein alone, colocalized with actin and caused cell retraction and disruption of the microfilament network.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Finally, wild-type L2, but not L2 with residues 25-45 deleted, facilitated HPV16 pseudovirion infection.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, binding of -actin by L2 residues 25-45 facilitates transport of HPV16 across the cytoplasm during infection, and blockade of this novel interaction may be useful for prophylaxis.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	13	Passive diffusion of molecules within the cytoplasm is limited by molecular crowding and does not provide targeting to a particular subcellular domain (1).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, many intracellular pathogens subvert existing transport mechanisms and cytoskeletal components, both to efficiently reach their site of replication and also for the exit of their progeny (2).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, and its role in locomotion is regulated by a plethora of actin- and tubulin-binding proteins, kinases, and phosphatases of multiple signaling cascades.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of actin regulatory proteins induce the condensation of actin "comet" tails behind endosomes (3), as well as the bacteria Listeria, Shigella, and Rickettsia (4) and viruses including vaccinia, baculovirus, and SV40, for propulsion through the cytoplasm (5, 6).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Other viruses employ cellular motors such as dyneins and kinesins for transport along microtubules.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A single virus type can employ several intracellular transport mechanisms.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Indeed, vaccinia particles are driven along microtubules by kinesin, whereupon actin tails take over propulsion (7, 8).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	20	Compelling epidemiologic and molecular virologic studies demonstrate that infection with an oncogenic type human papillomavirus (HPV),1 typified by HPV16, is a necessary cause of cervical cancer (9).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In the absence of effective screening programs, cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women (10).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Furthermore, oncogenic HPV infection is also strongly associated with vulval, anal, and penile cancers, some non-melanoma skin cancers, and esophageal and salivary cancers (11).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	23	 An understanding of the infectious process is critical to rational development of approaches for prevention of HPV-related cancers.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although several cellular molecules, including heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (12), 6 integrin (13), and CD16 (14), have been implicated as cell-surface receptors for papillomavirus, little else is known about cellular proteins that mediate cytoplasmic transport of papillomavirus and delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	25	The papillomavirus capsid comprises the major capsid protein L1 arranged as 72 pentamers, or capsomers, in a T=7d icosahedral surface lattice (15, 16) and a minor capsid protein, L2 (17), one molecule of which may be located at each vertex (18).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Overexpression of L1 alone is sufficient to form empty capsids, termed virus-like particles (VLPs) (19).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	27	 L1 VLPs bind to cell surfaces and compete with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) infection in vitro (20).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, both L1 and L2 are necessary for efficient production of papillomavirus and infection (21-23).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recent studies by Kawana et al.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	30	 (24, 25) suggest that residues 108-120 of L2 are displayed upon the virion exterior and bind to the cell surface, resulting in internalization.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Furthermore, anti-L2 antiserum neutralizes papillomavirus without preventing virion binding to the cell surface (26).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We recently demonstrated that L2 plays a critical role in infection, but is not required for interaction of papillomavirus particles with the cell surface (23).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Taken together, the data suggest that L1 mediates the initial binding of virions to the cell surface, whereas L2 provides later functions critical for infection.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	82	L2 Facilitates Perinuclear Trafficking-- To further define the role of L2 in the infectious process, we compared the binding, uptake, and intracellular transport of HPV16 VLPs containing both L1 and L2 (L1/L2 VLPs) with VLPs comprising only L1 (L1 VLPs) (27) in the permissive cell line BPHE-1 (29).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	83	 HPV16 VLPs were incubated with BPHE-1 cells for 1 h at 4  degrees C and visualized by indirect immunofluorescence.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	84	 As we previously demonstrated (20), VLPs comprising L1 and L2 or only L1 bound to cell surfaces with a similar pattern and degree (data not shown).

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	88	 At 30 min and 1, 2, and 6 h after shifting the BPHE-1 cells to 37  degrees C, the VLPs were localized (Fig.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Interestingly, L1/L2 VLPs aligned along distinct radial tracks across the cytoplasm and within ~2 h at 37  degrees C arrived in the perinuclear region (Fig.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, L1 VLPs were not aligned along such radial tracks.

0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	250	During the infectious process, an intracellular pathogen hijacks the normal cellular function of its receptor molecules for transportation to its site of replication.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Thus, study of such infectious pathways can both enhance our understanding of normal cellular transport as well as identify targets for intervention.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Although intracellular pathogens use diverse primary and secondary receptors to gain entry to the cell, the mechanisms employed for intracellular transport are more restricted.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	253	 For example, microorganisms as diverse as Listeria, Shigella, Rickettsia, vaccinia, and SV40 employ different receptors to gain entry to a cell, but a similar mode of intracellular transport (6, 34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	254	 However, despite their structural similarity to SV40 (18), the papillomaviruses use a distinct cell-surface receptor and entry pathway, about which little is known.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Indeed, three different surface molecules (12-14) have been proposed to bind to the major capsid protein L1 and to function as the primary receptor for papillomavirus.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Papillomavirus L1 pseudovirions prepared in vitro are infectious, although significantly less so than those containing L2 (38-40).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We have provided genetic evidence that L2 also plays a critical role during papillomavirus infection, but after the initial binding of the particle to the cell surface (23).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	258	 By virtue of its ability to bind to and enter cells, L2 was recently proposed to bind to a secondary viral receptor and to facilitate uptake (24).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The inability of L1 VLPs to enter the nucleus (41) and the importance of the DNA-binding and karyophilic domains of L2 to the infectious process suggest that interaction of L2 with the viral genome may play a key role in its delivery to the nucleus (23, 42).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	260	The high local protein concentration (as high as 300 mg/ml), organelles, and the cytoskeleton contribute to the molecular crowding within a cell that restricts the free diffusion of molecules of  > 500 kDa (1).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Because the papillomavirus capsid is 55 nm in diameter and  > 2000 kDa, its free diffusion within the cell will be extremely slow (15).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	262	 During infection, the virus needs to rapidly traffic to the nucleus, the site of viral replication, rather than to other organelles such as lysosomes.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	263	 To efficiently transport particles across the cytoplasm during infection, residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 bind to -actin, and this interaction influences microfilament structure.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	264	 However, understanding the mechanism of locomotion requires further investigation.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	265	The high degree of sequence conservation of the L2 motif (Fig.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	266	 6A) and the ability of both BPV1 and HPV16 L2 to bind actin suggest that this interaction is common to other papillomavirus genotypes and therefore may represent a useful target for the development of pan-papillomavirus-preventative treatments.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Indeed, antibody to L2 (but not L1) neutralizes diverse papillomavirus genotypes, suggesting that a conserved functional domain of L2 is displayed on the capsid surface (25, 43).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Furthermore, L2-specific neutralizing antibodies predominantly recognize its N terminus and do not prevent virions from binding to the cell surface (26), suggesting that neutralization may occur by a blockade of virion uptake or intracellular transport.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	269	Several pathogens have independently evolved mechanisms to harness the power of actin polymerization to get into and out of cells (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Indeed, the entry of a wide variety of viruses, including papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, vaccinia, Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus, adenovirus type 2, and echoviruses, is dependent upon actin polymerization as demonstrated by blockade with the inhibitor cytochalasin D (44).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	271	 However, this does not necessarily reflect a direct interaction between the virus and actin because actin function is necessary for receptor-mediated endocytosis and many other cellular processes.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	272	 californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus induces the formation of thick actin cables that frequently project toward the nucleus.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	273	 These actin cables are transiently formed in association with the viral nucleocapsids prior to viral gene expression and concomitantly with nucleocapsid transport to the nucleus (45).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Two virus-encoded capsid proteins, p39 and p78/83, in A.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	275	 californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus were found to bind to actin directly and therefore could be involved in the observed acceleration of actin polymerization by viral actin-binding proteins (46).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It is unclear how this effect relates to the changes in actin structure produced by overexpression of L2 residues 25-45 within the cytoplasm because neither papillomavirus L1/L2 VLPs nor L2 induces such actin cables.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	277	Both endosomes and diverse pathogens are able to recruit host cytoskeletal factors to induce the polymerization of actin filaments from their surface into a structure known as a comet tail for intracellular propulsion (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	278	 However, the presence of L2 or L1/L2 VLPs during infection did not promote the formation of such actin comet tails, suggesting that interaction of L2 with -actin facilitates particle transport by another mechanism.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	279	Actin is an ATPase, and ATP hydrolysis affects the kinetics of polymerization (47).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In vivo, actin polymerization is a highly regulated process controlled both by ATP binding and hydrolysis and by the action of a number of actin-binding proteins that initiate, cleave, cross-link, stabilize, or destabilize the filaments (48).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Actin comet tails result from a depolymerization of filamentous actin and re-polymerization behind the particle (34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Interestingly, overexpression of the -actin-binding motif comprising residues 25-45 of HPV16 L2 in the cytoplasm was associated with the redistribution of actin in COS-7 cells and altered cell morphology.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	283	 This is consistent with a functional interaction between L2 and actin in vivo that orchestrates the intracellular motility of papillomavirus during infection.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	284	In addition to promoting uptake, the actin cytoskeleton facilitates egress of vaccinia from infected cells (8, 34).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The spread of vaccinia is enhanced by actin tail formation that is triggered via tyrosine phosphorylation of A36R.
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Herpesvirus type 1 VP22 exploits microfilaments to promote intercellular spreading (49).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Furthermore, interaction of the Black Creek Canal virus N protein with actin microfilaments is required for virion morphogenesis and release, but not infection (50).
0.37472588.12560332.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, papillomavirus accumulates in microcrystalline arrays within the nucleus of productively infected cells, and there is currently no evidence for such an egress pathway mediated by L2-actin interaction.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and viral load and proliferation rate in pre-, ongoing and post-treatment respiratory papillomatosis biopsies were examined retrospectively in 25 patients, 18 of whom were IFN- treated and seven of whom were IFN- non-treated.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Using PCR, HPV was found to be present in 20/25 respiratory papillomatosis patients and HPV type was determined for 18/25 patients (12 HPV6 and six HPV11).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Eighteen of the patients were treated with IFN-, 14 of whom were HPV positive (eight HPV6, five HPV11 and one undefined HPV).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Response to IFN- therapy was observed in 12 patients (7/8 HPV6, 3/5 HPV11, 1/1 undefined HPV and 1/4 HPV negative), while six patients (1/8 HPV6, 2/5 HPV11 and 3/4 HPV negative) did not respond to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Viral load, determined by quantitative real-time PCR (between 0 03 and 533 HPV copies per cell), and proliferation rate, determined as the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells (between 8 and 54 %), were similar in IFN--treated and non-treated patients and were generally unaffected by IFN- treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In summary, most (12/18) IFN--treated patients responded to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Moreover, there was a tendency for patients with HPV6-positive (7/8) respiratory papillomatosis to respond more frequently to IFN- therapy than patients with HPV11 (3/5) or HPV-negative (1/4) respiratory papillomatosis.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Finally, the presence of HPV and viral load and proliferation in respiratory papillomatosis biopsies was similar in patients treated or not with IFN- and were in general unaffected by IFN- treatment.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It is most frequently ( > 90 %) located on the vocal cords (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The most common age of onset is early childhood (juvenile RRP with age of onset below 13 years of age), but the disease is also seen in adults (adult RRP) (Abramson et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	16	 RRP is regarded as being induced by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV type 6 (HPV6) and HPV11, and shows a variable clinical course (Abramson et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The primary therapeutic method is endoscopic surgery, and approximately one-tenth of patients are cured after the first surgical intervention.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Spontaneous remissions are also seen, but in the majority of patients the disease is recurrent and thereby demands other treatment methods.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition to surgery, the only well-documented treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis is interferon (IFN)-, which has been widely used for more than 20 years and has been proposed to decrease the number of recurrences considerably (Deunas et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although IFN- has been used clinically for decades as a proven anti-tumour agent in a variety of malignant and non-malignant neoplastic disorders, the underlying mechanisms of its action remain to be elucidated.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Furthermore, since IFN- treatment is burdened with side effects for most patients and the cost is considerable, markers to predict which patients may be responsive to such treatment remains a challenge for future studies.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	22	 New substances for treatment of patients with respiratory papillomatosis such as cidofovir, acyclovir and ribavirin (Kimberlin, 2004) are currently being evaluated, but their role in controlling this disease is still uncertain.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Since surgery alone is commonly not sufficient for disease control of RRP, there is a need for adjuvant treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	132	 IFN- has, for several decades, been the drug of choice (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	133	 To achieve remission, long-term treatment, in many cases associated with severe side effects, is necessary.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In order to prevent unnecessary treatment for those patients resistant to IFN- therapy and those with a low risk of relapse after surgery, an extended investigation of potentially predictive factors is desirable.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	135	In this study, biopsies from 25 respiratory papillomatosis patients, 18 of whom had been subjected to IFN- treatment, were examined for the presence of HPV and to determine viral load and proliferation rate in order to find a possible means of IFN- action and to identify patients who might benefit from therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	136	Of the respiratory papillomatosis biopsies investigated, the majority were determined to be HPV positive, which was similar to previous observations (Lie et al.

0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	141	 However, males were dominant as a whole and more so in the IFN--treated group (Table 1).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	142	Biopsies taken prior to IFN- treatment were available for the majority of the treated patients and presence of HPV was demonstrated by PCR in 11/16 cases and 73 % of the HPV-positive cases responded to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It is remarkable that HPV could not be detected in some biopsies before treatment, but this could be due in part to a low viral load.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In fact, among the five pre-treatment respiratory papillomatosis cases that were originally determined as HPV negative, two biopsies taken later during IFN- treatment were HPV6 positive and these two patients also responded to IFN- treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	145	Summarizing the data on HPV and HPV type, a tendency was observed for HPV6 cases to respond more readily to therapy than HPV11 and HPV-negative cases, but this difference was not statistically significant, although it was close to the borderline (P=0 067) between the HPV6 and HPV-negative groups.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We have no explanation for the tendency of HPV6-positive papillomas to respond more readily to IFN- treatment than the HPV11-positive cases; however, it has been suggested HPV11-associated papillomatosis is more aggressive than HPV6-associated disease (Rabah et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Furthermore, a correlation between virus genotype and response to IFN treatment has been noted for other viruses such as hepatitis C virus (Tan  and  Katze, 2001).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	148	The viral load varied considerably among biopsies, and patients with various pre-treatment loads responded to IFN- therapy, indicating that patients with a low as well as a high viral load can respond to IFN-.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In addition, viral load was generally not significantly affected during IFN- treatment, although in some HPV6 cases the viral load had a tendency to decrease, while the opposite tendency was observed for the HPV11 cases.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Nevertheless, a significant increase in viral load could be observed after IFN- withdrawal in four cases (Table 2), indicating a risk for rebound phenomena, observed in clinical practice as an increase in the numbers of papillomas (Kimberlin  and  Malis, 2000).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	151	The absence of influence of IFN- on viral load during treatment was not anticipated and could possibly be due to the limited number of patients included in this study.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, this has been reported previously although not by quantitative PCR (Steinberg et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	153	It is possible that IFN- exerts its mechanisms by other means.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	154	 One possibility is enhancement of an immunological response against the HPV-infected cells, for example by increasing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	155	 An increase in MHC expression would consequently increase the ability of the immune system to respond to and combat HPV-positive respiratory papillomatosis, without directly influencing the viral load extensively in the remaining respiratory papillomatosis cells during treatment.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This mechanism could also explain why cell proliferation was not affected during IFN- treatment as discussed below.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	157	Another possibility could be that IFN increases the rate of apoptosis in virus-infected cells.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This could also lead to a decreased amount of papilloma cells, but with maintained levels of virus.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	159	 IFN- has been shown to act pro-apoptotically in neoplastic cells and we have recently found that expression of the HPV16 E7 oncogene may sensitize tumour cells to IFN-induced apoptosis (Thyrell et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Whether induction of apoptosis explains the clinical effects of IFN- in respiratory papillomatosis, however, remains to be investigated.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	161	IFN- is also known to exert anti-proliferative effects in many cell types and this has been suggested also to be of importance in its anti-neoplastic activities (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998).
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	162	Cell proliferation was determined by the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells by immunohistochemistry and there was no significant difference between the cell proliferation observed in patients treated and not treated with IFN-.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Moreover, the Ki-67 index was not significantly affected during IFN- treatment and did not differ significantly between patients who responded or did not respond to IFN- therapy, which was unexpected.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	164	 To our knowledge, there have been no other reports on comparison on the effect of IFN- on the proliferation rate in respiratory papillomatosis.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	165	HPV clearly induces perturbed regulation of the cell cycle, manifested in the relatively high percentage of cycling cells in most papillomas.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	166	 IFN- seems to act as an anti-proliferative agent through alterations impinging on the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, and the HPV-induced alteration in the cell-cycle machinery may be responsible for the lack of IFN--induced anti-proliferative effects (Sangfelt et al.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	167	 IFN- may also exert its anti-tumour function by other means, such as inhibition of angiogenesis, as well as induction of differentiation (Grander  and  Einhorn, 1998), which could play a role in the papillomatosis setting, although this needs to be studied in detail.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	168	In conclusion, this is one of few studies investigating the putative anti-tumour effects of IFN- in vivo during treatment, aimed at defining the mechanism of action of IFN-, as well as defining predictive markers for IFN- therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	169	 One reason for the limited number of similar studies is that IFN- treatment is not used as a standard therapy for RRP.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Nevertheless, even though the RRP patient group in this study was heterogeneous (age, clinical course, treatment strategy), most IFN--treated patients responded to therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Furthermore, there was a tendency for HPV6-positive cases to respond better than HPV-11-positive and HPV-negative cases to IFN- therapy.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Interestingly, in this highly IFN--responsive disease, the prominent anti-tumour effects were not reflected as IFN--induced changes in fundamental disease-related parameters, such as viral load and the hyperproliferative state of the HPV-affected epithelium.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Finally, although this study does not conclusively pinpoint the mechanism for successful IFN- treatment, it suggests that some of these analysed factors can be ruled out as possible markers for response prediction.
0.28238976.15914847.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The study also indicates areas for future investigation aimed at selecting patients who may benefit from IFN- treatment.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Clathrin-mediated vesicular internalization of L1 via the tyrosine-based endocytosis motif YRSL regulates adhesion and signaling by this Ig superfamily molecule.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Here, we present evidence that tyrosine-1176 (Y1176) of the YRSL motif is phosphorylated in vivo.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (p60src) is implicated in L1-mediated neurite outgrowth, and we find that p60src phosphorylates Y1176 in vitro.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Phosphorylation of Y1176 prevents L1 binding to AP-2, an adaptor required for clathrin-mediated internalization of L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	13	 mAb 74-5H7 recognizes the sequence immediately NH2-terminal to the tyrosine-based motif and binds L1 only when Y1176 is dephosphorylated.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	14	 74-5H7 identifies a subset of L1 present at points of cell to cell contact and in vesicle-like structures that colocalize with an endocytosis marker.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	15	 L1 to L1 binding or L1 cross-linking induces a rapid increase in 74-5H7 immunoreactivity.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our data suggest a model in which homophilic binding or L1 cross-linking triggers transient dephosphorylation of the YRSL motif that makes L1 available for endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Thus, the regulation of L1 endocytosis through dephosphorylation of Y1176 is a critical regulatory point of L1-mediated adhesion and signaling.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	19	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   The immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule (IgSF CAM) L1 participates in several processes that are essential for the normal development of the nervous system.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Processes such as neurite extension and neuronal migration require dynamic regulation of the cell adhesion mediated by L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This is controlled in part by internalization of L1 to regulate the availability of L1 on the cell surface.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	22	 L1 internalization is controlled by interactions of its cytoplasmic domain with signaling, cytoskeletal, and internalization machinery (Long and Lemmon, 2000).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	23	The L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1CD)* is not required for adhesion, but it is needed for regulation of adhesion by signal transduction and internalization.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Interestingly, mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the human L1 gene impair the formation of major axon tracts in neural development (for review see Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	25	 One important function of the L1CD that has been analyzed in detail is the regulation of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface distribution of L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Neuronal L1 differs from L1 found in nonneuronal cells such as Schwann cells and neuroblastoma cell lines in that it contains four amino acids (RSLE) in the cytoplasmic domain encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 28 (Miura et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The RSLE stretch immediately follows tyrosine 1176.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The composite sequence (YRSLE) forms a tyrosine-based sorting motif that is required for endocytosis of L1 via clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Like tyrosine-based sorting signals characterized in other proteins (Ohno et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	30	, 1996), the YRSLE sequence found in L1 serves as a binding site for the  micro2 chain of the clathrin-associated AP-2 complex in vitro, and a number of endocytic machinery components can be coimmunoprecipitated with L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Furthermore, mutating tyrosine 1176 (Y1176) or removing the RSLE exon also prevents L1 from interacting with AP-2, and consequently prevents clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons growing on an L1-Fc substrate, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of growth cones, suggesting local regulation of L1 endocytosis and that its recycling may be important in growth cone motility (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Indeed, blocking AP-2 to mediated internalization of L1 inhibits L1-based neurite growth in part by disrupting a gradient of L1 adhesivity from the growth cone periphery to the central domain (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Finally, the neuronal form of L1 (with YRSLE) is significantly less adhesive than the nonneuronal form due to its more rapid internalization and shorter dwell time on the cell surface (Long et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	35	Phosphorylation is likely to play a critical role in regulating L1-mediated processes such as neurite outgrowth (Atashi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	36	 L1 is phosphorylated on both serine and tyrosine residues in cultured neurons, and clustering of L1 on cultured cells with cross-linking antibodies can trigger changes in both kinase and phosphatase activity (Klinz et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	37	, 1999), as well as in the phosphorylation state of L1 (Zisch et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Several kinase activities coimmunoprecipitate with L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We have identified three L1-associated kinases, CKII, p90rsk, and ERK2, that can phosphorylate certain serine residues in the L1CD in vitro (Wong et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Inhibition of p90rsk phosphorylation of L1 impairs DRG neurite outgrowth on L1 but not on laminin substrates.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Furthermore, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, which includes p90rsk and ERK2, requires L1 endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Tyrosine kinases, such as p60src and FGF receptor, have also been implicated in L1 signaling (Ignelzi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	43	, 1994; Doherty and Walsh, 1996), and the receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2, is capable of phosphorylating L1 (Zisch et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate associations between L1 and the cytoskeleton.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	45	 For example, both L1 and the L1 family members neurofascin and NrCAM associate with the membrane cytoskeleton protein ankyrin, and phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the ankyrin binding site of neurofascin, which is conserved in L1, disrupts this association (Tuvia et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	46	Here, we present evidence that outside-in signaling dynamically regulates the functional state of the L1CD via dephosphorylation.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We have characterized the mAb 74-5H7 that recognizes a subset of L1 at points of cell to cell contact and in vesicular structures.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation of L1 and maps to the region immediately preceding the tyrosine-based sorting motif.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In vitro studies show that phosphorylation within the epitope prevents recognition by 74-5H7 and also binding of AP-2 to L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We have identified the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p60src as an L1-phosphorylating kinase that preferentially phosphorylates Y1176 of the tyrosine-based sorting motif in vitro.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Cell to cell contact is able to induce changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 that is recognized by 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	52	 These data demonstrate that L1 to L1 binding induces a functional change in the L1CD mediated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	53	   Results Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   mAb 74-5H7 recognizes a special fraction of L1 in neurons Chick DRG neurons growing in culture have L1 distributed over their entire surfaces (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	54	 When mAb 74-5H7 was used for immunocytochemistry, however, we were surprised to find that immunoreactivity (IR) was concentrated at points of contact between DRG neuron cell bodies in culture (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Previous characterization of 74-5H7 indicated that it recognizes L1 exclusively on Western blots of whole brain extracts and can immunoprecipitate mammalian and chick L1 (Lemmon et al.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This analysis identified five amino acids, SEARPMKDETFGEY (underlined) that when individually changed to alanine, abolish 74-5H7 binding (Fig.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Although only these five amino acids were identified as critical for 74-5H7 binding, we were unable to detect binding to peptides shorter than the SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence, suggesting there may be structural contributions to the epitope from other residues (unpublished data).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The SEARPMKDETFGEY peptide also competed with purified L1 for 74-5H7 binding, confirming the importance of this sequence for mAb recognition of L1 (Fig.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	181	  Although the cell pelleting experiments described above indicate that cell to cell contact dramatically increases 74-5H7-IR, the cell pelleting paradigm involves inducing contact among many types of cell surface receptors present on brain cells in addition to L1.

0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	224	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   We have presented evidence that L1 homophilic binding and L1 cross-linking at the cell surface induce a transient change in the phosphorylation state of the L1CD that can regulate its association with the endocytic machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This regulation of L1 internalization provides a means to control adhesion and facilitate growth cone movement.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Our present studies depend in large measure on mAb 74-5H7.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Several lines of evidence showed that this antibody binds to a subset of L1 and binding to L1 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	228	 First, several epitope mapping experiments demonstrate that 74-5H7 recognizes the sequence SEARPMKDETFGEY, and that phosphorylation of Y1176 inhibits recognition.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Second, L1 purified from brain extract in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors has weak 74-5H7-IR, whereas L1 purified in the absence of inhibitors shows stronger 74-5H7-IR.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	230	 We showed that the L1CD could be phosphorylated by src on Y1176 and that an antibody specific for pYRSLE showed that the corresponding epitope on L1 was present in brain.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Immunohistochemical studies of growth cones with 74-5H7 revealed that this form of L1 is restricted, being absent from filopodia and concentrated in vesicle-like structures.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Finally, experiments using neurons and L1 expressing myelomas showed that cell contact or antibody cross-linking of L1 caused significant but transient changes in the phosphorylation state of L1 on Y1176.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Together, these data show that L1 mediated contact causes an outside-in signal that alters the phosphorylation state of L1 and this, in turn, alters L1 internalization and adhesion, a form of inside-out signaling.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	234	The SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence, where 74-5H7 binds, is perfectly conserved in human, mouse, rat, chicken, and fugu fish L1 homologues.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Although the complete SEARPMKDETFGEY sequence is not conserved in other vertebrate L1 homologues, acidic residues NH2-terminal to Y1176 and a hydrophobic residue at the Y-3 position are conserved not just in direct L1 homologues, but also in the L1 family members Nr-CAM and neurofascin (Hortsch, 1996).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Previous data implicate p60 src in L1 function, because src-/- neurons extend poorly on L1 substrates, suggesting their response to L1 is impaired (Ignelzi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Our finding that p60src can phosphorylate Y1176 provides potential mechanistic insight into this phenotype.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We suggest that L1 in src-/- neurons grown on L1 may be relatively hypophosphorylated at Y1176.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This could alter the regulation of L1 endocytosis; disruption of L1 trafficking could in turn impair neurite outgrowth on L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Suter and Forscher (2001) recently showed that p60src activity could be involved in a positive feedback loop strengthening CAM interactions with their cytoskeletal linkages.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Our data support a similar role for p60src in which it could phosphorylate L1 under certain conditions, thereby inhibiting internalization and increasing adhesion.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	242	The 74-5H7 epitope is adjacent to the tyrosine-based motif, Yxx ( is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) in the L1CD that mediates L1 endocytosis (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Studies of tyrosine-based sorting motifs in other proteins indicate that the tyrosine has to be in a nonphosphorylated state for the signals to be active in sorting and endocytosis; i.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	244	, phosphorylation of the tyrosine prevents binding of adaptin proteins to the motif (Boll et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Indeed, our in vitro peptide competition experiments using peptides derived from L1 show that a Y1176-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the potential p60src phosphorylation site, FGEpYRSLESDNEE, is no longer able to bind the  micro2 chain of AP-2, whereas a serine 1181-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the CKII phosphorylation site, FGEYRSLEpSDNEE, retains its capacity to associate with  micro2.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	246	 It is highly unlikely that T1172 influences L1 to AP-2 interactions because there is no evidence suggesting it is phosphorylated, and extensive studies show that the fourth residue in the amino-terminal direction does not influence  micro2 binding to tyrosine-based sorting motifs (Boll et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Our results show that the 74-5H7-IR is inhibited by phosphorylation of Y1176 and that src family kinases may mediate this.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Similarly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the T lymphocyte receptor, CTLA-4, has been shown to be negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine in the endocytosis motif (Bradshaw et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	249	, 1997) and this is likely by src family kinases (Miyatake et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Overall, our results imply that only L1 that can bind 74-5H7 is capable of interacting with the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This is consistent with the finding that in growth cones growing on L1 substrates, 74-5H7-IR is at the rear of growth cones, where L1 is internalized and colocalizes with Eps15, a marker for clathrin-coated pits (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We have shown previously that inhibition of L1 endocytosis dramatically increases L1-mediated adhesion (Long et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	253	 L1 at the rear of growth cones growing on L1 is less adhesive than L1 at the front of the growth cones, but this differential is not observed on growth cones growing on N-cadherin (Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Therefore, phosphorylation of Y1176 provides a rapid but reversible means of increasing L1-mediated adhesion.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	255	The hypothesis that the 74-5H7 epitope is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation implies the involvement of L1 phosphatases in its regulation and is consistent with early results that show that cross-linking L1 activates tyrosine and serine phosphatases (Klinz et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	256	 A number of potential candidate phosphatases exist.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	257	 These include phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) that prefer substrates containing acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine such as PTP1B, and rat brain PTP1 (for review see Zhou and Cantley, 1995).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Another candidate is the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ss because of its ability to bind heterophilically with L1 family CAMs.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The phosphatase may also be coexpressed in some of the same cell types as L1 (Peles et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It has been suggested that acidic residues NH2-terminal to the phosphotyrosine residue are a hallmark for targeted dephosphorylation (Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996) and that the number, nature, and position of the acidic residues may create consensus sequences that are recognized selectively by individual PTPases (Pinna and Donella-Deana, 1994).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	261	The simplest interpretation of our biochemical analysis of the 74-5H7 epitope is that unengaged L1 is phosphorylated on Y1176, and that Y1176 becomes dephosphorylated subsequent to L1 ligand binding.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Dephosphorylation allows interaction with AP-2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In this paradigm, the time course of 74-5H7-IR observed in the cell pelleting experiments could reflect internalization and subsequent recycling (and rephosphorylation) of L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Our immunohistochemical observations of the distribution of 74-5H7-IR suggest the situation is more complex, however, and that L1 to L1 binding does not always induce L1 endocytosis.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	265	 First, L1 can mediate stable axon fasciculation, suggesting it is not invariably endocytosed at points of L1 to L1 binding.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Second, although growing DRG neurons on L1 increases L1 internalization and subsequent recycling (Kamiguchi and Lemmon, 2000; Kamiguchi and Yoshihara, 2001), endocytosis of L1 occurs preferentially at the rear of the growth cone.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	267	 74-5H7-IR is colocalized with vesicle-like structures in these neurons, rather than just at points of contact between the growth cone and the L1-Fc substrate (Kamiguchi et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	268	 These observations suggest that dephosphorylation of Y1176 and L1 endocytosis in growth cones are not regulated solely by L1 to L1 binding, but also by restricted localization of the dephosphorylation machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	269	 We cannot rule out the possibility that, in vivo, the 74-5H7 epitope in some L1 is masked by interactions with other proteins, such as cytoskeletal components (Brophy, 2001).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Thus, although 74-5H7 clearly identifies a subset of L1 in cells that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, there may be other populations of L1 that are dephosphorylated at Y1176, but not accessible to the antibody and thus not visualized in immunocytochemical experiments.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	271	In summary, we have used 74-5H7 to show that L1 is dephosphorylated at Y1176 where L1 is internalized and trafficking in growth cones.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	272	 We have also shown that the phosphorylation state of Y1176 determines whether L1 can interact with the clathrin internalization machinery.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	273	 A variety of experiments showed that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation state of L1 is regulated by cell contact and restricted to specific sites in neurons.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The phosphorylation of the L1CD on Y1176 by p60src that is important for L1-mediated neurite outgrowth raises the possibility that the regulation of L1 internalization by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation represents a critical regulatory point for L1.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The ability of L1 to L1 adhesion to influence its endocytosis is reminiscent of how other surfaces can influence integrin expression on neurites (Condic and Letourneau, 1997).
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In Aplysia, the distribution of apCAM, an IgSF CAM member, is acutely regulated by endocytosis during learning-induced synaptic remodeling (Bailey et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	277	, 1992), whereas in Drosophila, changing the distribution of another IgSF member, fasciclin II, alters synapse size (Schuster et al.
0.175064.12082080.html.plaintext.txt	278	 It appears that regulated endocytosis may be a general mechanism underlying CAM functions in dynamic processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA replication is initiated by recruitment of the E1 helicase by the E2 protein to the viral origin.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Screening of our corporate compound collection with an assay measuring the cooperative binding of E1 and E2 to the origin identified a class of small molecule inhibitors of the protein interaction between E1 and E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Isothermal titration calorimetry and changes in protein fluorescence showed that the inhibitors bind to the transactivation domain of E2, the region that interacts with E1.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These compounds inhibit E2 of the low risk HPV types 6 and 11 but not those of high risk HPV types or of cottontail rabbit papillomavirus.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Functional evidence that the transactivation domain is the target of inhibition was obtained by swapping this domain between a sensitive (HPV11) and a resistant (cottontail rabbit papillomavirus) E2 type and by identifying an amino acid substitution, E100A, that increases inhibition by 10-fold.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This class of inhibitors was found to antagonize specifically the E1-E2 interaction in vivo and to inhibit HPV DNA replication in transiently transfected cells.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These results highlight the potential of the E1-E2 interaction as a small molecule antiviral target.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Papillomaviruses are a family of small double-stranded DNA viruses that induce benign and malignant hyperproliferative lesions of the differentiating epithelium (reviewed in Refs.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Approximately 25 types of human papillomavirus (HPV)1 infect the anogenital region.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These HPV types have been classified as low risk or high risk types depending on whether they cause benign warts or lesions that can progress to invasive cancer, respectively.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Current therapies to remove HPV-induced lesions include a variety of ablative or cytodestructive procedures and the use of immunomodulatory molecules such as imiquimod (5, 6) to stimulate a host immune response.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Small molecule antivirals for the treatment of HPV infections do not currently exist.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	18	The life cycle of HPV is coupled to the cellular differentiation program that occurs in the epithelium (7).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Maintenance of the viral genome in infected cells of the basal layer is essential for the viral life cycle and the ensuing pathology.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Maintenance of the HPV episome in primary keratinocyte cultures depends on the function of E1 and E2, a 3'-5' helicase (8) and a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (9), respectively, which are required for replication of the genome (10).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	21	 HPV DNA replication is initiated by the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to specific DNA sequences within the viral origin (11 to 14).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Formation of this E1-E2-ori ternary complex is dependent on the interaction of both proteins with DNA but also on a critical interaction between the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of E2 and the C-terminal enzymatic domain of E1 (15 to 22).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Assembly of this initial E1-E2-ori complex serves as a starting point for the recruitment of additional E1 molecules (23, 24) and their assembly into hexamers and double hexamers that have ATPase and helicase activity (25, 26).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	24	Any of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions occurring at the origin could in principle be targeted for the development of small molecule antivirals to treat HPV infections.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In reality, however, not all targets are readily amenable to inhibition by small molecules.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Protein interactions for example have been considered difficult to inhibit because they often involve large surfaces devoid of small molecule binding pockets (27, 28).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the absence of structural information, one often has to rely on screening large compound collections to determine whether a protein can be antagonized by small molecules and for the identification of lead inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	28	Here we present a class of small molecules that bind reversibly to the E2 transactivation domain and inhibit the E1-E2 protein interaction in vitro and in vivo.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The chemical features and synthetic procedures for these molecules will be described elsewhere.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	30	2 To our knowledge these are the first small molecule inhibitors of HPV DNA replication with cellular activity.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	178	E2 can be divided into an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD, approximately amino acids 1 to 200) and a C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain (DBD, the last 100 amino acids), separated by a 50 to 70-amino acid "hinge" with little predicted secondary structure (9).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Because for HPV11 it is known that the TAD, but not the DBD, interacts with E1 (16, 40), we repeated the titration with a GST fusion protein encoding the E2 TAD, as well as with GST itself as a negative control (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The results clearly indicated saturable binding of 2 to the GST-TAD but not to GST, indicating that the compound binds to the TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Similar results were also obtained with a polyhistidine-tagged version of the E2 TAD (data not shown).

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The observed 2:1 stoichiometry is consistent with the formation of a 1:1 inhibitor-protein complex, because compound 2 is racemic, and it has been observed for other compounds in this series that only one of the two enantiomers is active (see below).

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	194	 CRPV E2, however, was found to be resistant to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	195	 6), perhaps not surprisingly given the low level of amino acid identity between the TAD of HPV11 and that of CRPV.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Similarly, we found that the inhibitors are inactive against the E2 protein of the high risk HPV types 16, 18, and 31 (data not shown), which at the amino acid level are only 41 to 50% identical to HPV11 E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	197	 We made use of the observation that some E2 types are resistant to inhibition to substantiate the finding that the TAD is indeed the target of the inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Specifically, we constructed chimeric E2 proteins encoding the HPV11 TAD with the hinge and DNA-binding domain from CRPV, or the opposite combination.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These chimeras were expressed in vitro and tested in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay using HPV11 E1.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Both chimeras could bind co-operatively with E1 on the origin, but only the one containing the TAD from HPV11 was sensitive to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This result provides functional evidence that the TAD is indeed the target of inhibition.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	203	 To determine whether inhibition of E1-E2-ori complex formation was reversible, we performed the preincubation experiment shown in Fig.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	205	 We reasoned that if the inhibitor is acting by a reversible mechanism, the activity of E2 should be recovered upon dilution of the inhibitor.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, if the mechanism of inhibition is irreversible then significant inhibition should be observed even after dilution.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	207	 As a control, we used the known reactive electrophile, 4-fluoro-7-nitro-(2,1,3)-benzoxadiazole.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Specifically, this assay measures the expression of a SEAP reporter gene, placed under the control of the HPV11 minimal origin of replication, upon co-transfection of two plasmids encoding, respectively, E2 and the E1 protein fused to the strong transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (Fig.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The lack of transactivation by E2 is consistent with the previous observation that E2 of the low risk HPV types are weak transactivators (41).

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	268	To gain additional evidence that the inhibitors were acting in vivo by the same mechanism as in vitro, we made use of a mutant E2 protein that has a higher affinity for this class of inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This mutant protein contains a single amino substitution in the TAD, E100A, which makes it 10-fold more sensitive to this class of inhibitors than wild type E2 in the in vitro E1-E2-ori complex formation assay.

0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	273	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Discovery of Inhibitors of the E1-E2 Interaction In this work we have presented the identification of the first small molecule inhibitors of the E1-E2 protein interaction capable of inhibiting HPV DNA replication in vivo.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	274	 We have shown by two independent biophysical methods, changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry, that compounds 1-3 bind to the transactivation domain of E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Functional evidence for binding to the E2 TAD was also obtained by swapping this domain between a sensitive E2 type (HPV11) and a resistant one (CRPV), as well as by identifying an amino acid within the TAD, E100A, that increases inhibition by 10-fold in vitro.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	276	The discovery of inhibitors of the E1-E2 protein interaction from HPV types 6 and 11 highlights the potential of E2 as a drug target for the treatment of anogenital warts.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The genome of HPV6 and HPV11 is present in episomal form in 90% of genital warts (42, 43), and inhibition of the E1-E2 interaction is expected to provide therapeutic benefits (44).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In this respect, it is worth noting that E1 and E2 are likely to be expressed at much lower levels in natural infections than in transfected cells, a fact that could lead us to underestimate the true potency of these inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Determining the real antiviral activity of these inhibitors awaits the development of a straightforward and quantitative HPV viral replication assay.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	280	Specificity of Inhibition The inhibitors presented in this study are active against the E2 protein of the two most prevalent low risk HPV types, 6 and 11, but are nevertheless more potent against the HPV11 protein by 10 to 40-fold in vitro.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This difference in potency was observed both with purified proteins and with proteins produced by in vitro translation.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Because we have found no evidence that HPV6 E1 and E2 interacts more strongly than the HPV11 proteins (data not shown), we surmise that the inhibitors must bind less tightly to HPV6 E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The HPV6 and HPV11 TAD are 84% identical at the primary amino acid sequence levels, and any of the amino acid differences or combinations thereof could affect binding of the inhibitor.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Surprisingly, we found that the difference in potency observed in cellular assays is less pronounced.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Indeed, the difference in IC50 values is only 3-fold in the transient HPV DNA replication assay.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	286	3 This reduced difference between type 6 and 11 was also observed in the E1-E2 interaction reporter gene assay suggesting that this class of compound does indeed inhibit the E1-E2 interaction of both HPV types with comparable potency in cells.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	287	 It is possible that a conformational change necessary for inhibitor binding has a more similar energetic cost for both HPV types in vivo than in vitro, perhaps because the conformation of E2 in vivo is slightly different as a result of interaction with cellular proteins.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Further studies will be required to address this possibility.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	289	Amino Acids in E2 Involved in Inhibition Prior to this report a 15-amino acid peptide derived from HPV16 E2 and spanning residue Glu-39 was shown to be capable of inhibiting the E1-E2 interaction in vitro (45).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Several studies have suggested an essential role for Glu-39 in interaction with E1.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Specifically, changing this residue to alanine was shown to abrogate the ability of E2 to bind to E1 (36 to 38), as confirmed in this study, while having little effect on its transcriptional activity.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	292	 These findings suggested that Glu-39 might form part of the E1-binding surface on E2.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Two lines of evidence suggest that our inhibitors may bind near Glu-39 to antagonize the E1-E2 interaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	294	 First, the Glu-100 residue, which when changed to alanine increases the sensitivity of HPV11 E2 to our inhibitors, is located on the same surface as Glu-39 in the crystal structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD (46).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Second, we found that our inhibitors bind with reduced affinity to the E39A mutant E2 TAD in fluorescence studies similar to those presented in Fig.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The simplest interpretation of these results is that the surface of the E2 TAD onto which Glu-39 and Glu-100 are located is involved in binding both E1 and our inhibitors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Because these inhibitors are inactive against HPV16 E2, we did not attempt to model them into the published structure of the HPV16 E2 TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	298	 However, further studies are in progress to localize the inhibitor-binding pocket on the HPV11 E2 TAD.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	299	Protein Interactions as Drug Targets The compounds presented here belong to a relatively small group of small molecules that effectively inhibit protein interactions.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	300	 With only a few exceptions most protein interaction inhibitors have been identified for cases in which the binding surface for one protein is known to be a small contiguous region, such as for receptor-ligand interactions (47, 48).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Many of the small molecules reported to inhibit protein interactions are peptides identified either by screening procedures such as phage display, or from panels of overlapping peptides based on the protein sequence, or selected based on results of structural or mutational studies (49).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Most of these peptides are relatively weak inhibitors, and although in principle these can serve as lead compounds for drug discovery, in practice transformation of such molecules into potent non-peptidic inhibitors is quite challenging.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	303	A variety of reasons has been proposed for the relatively low number of small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	304	 One is that small molecules would have difficulty competing against the large surface area typically involved in protein-protein interface.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	305	 However, it has been shown in a number of cases (e.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	306	 50) that substitution of a single critical residue at an interface, which is conceptually analogous to tight binding of a small molecule, is sufficient to greatly weaken an interaction.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	307	 An example of this may be the E39A substitution in E2, which as argued above may abrogate E1 binding because it is located at the E1-E2 interface.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	308	 A second reason why protein interactions are thought to be difficult targets for small molecules is because their interfaces can be fairly flat and devoid of concave pockets analogous to enzyme-active sites or receptor-binding sites (51).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Although this is true for some complexes, others have been found to be "bumpy" such that small cavities are often present (52, 53).
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Perhaps relatively few protein interaction inhibitors have been identified to date only because more effort has been devoted to traditional targets, such as enzymes and receptors.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	311	 We have in fact succeeded in identifying potent small molecule inhibitors of the E1-E2 interaction by high throughput screening.
0.2327217.12730224.html.plaintext.txt	312	 This strongly suggests that other investigations will also yield novel small molecule inhibitors of protein interactions as drug candidates.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We find that three independent ri alleles have alterations mapping within the L2-enhancer element and show that two of these observed lesions eliminate the ability of the enhancer element to direct gene expression in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The L2 enhancer can be subdivided into distinct activation and repression domains.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The activation domain mediates the combined action of the general wing activator Scalloped and a putative locally provided factor, the activity of which is abrogated by a single nucleotide alteration in the ri53j mutant.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We also find that misexpression of genes in L2 that are normally expressed in veins other than L2 results in abnormal L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These experiments provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how kni and knrl link AP patterning to morphogenesis of the L2 vein by orchestrating the expression of a selective subset of vein-promoting genes in the L2 primordium.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   One of the important remaining questions in developmental biology is to understand how positional information is linked to the genesis of specific morphological structures in different locations of the organism.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The Drosophila wing is a system that is particularly well suited for studying the relationship between patterning and morphogenesis.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For example, mechanisms for establishing positional information along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis have been analyzed in detail (reviewed by Lawrence and Struhl, 1996; Strigini and Cohen, 1999; Klein, 2001) and morphological structures such as the five major longitudinal veins (L1-L5) form at invariant positions along the AP axis of the adult wing (reviewed by Garcia-Bellido and de Celis, 1992; Bier, 2000).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	18	 As described below, the five wing veins can be distinguished from one another by several criteria including: expression of specific combinations of genes during development; whether they are located primarily on the dorsal or ventral surfaces of the wing (odd versus even numbered veins respectively); and by the types or absence of sensory organs that form along them (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	19	 sensory organs form on the L1 and L3 veins, but not on the L2, L4 or L5 veins).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	20	 An interesting question then, is how vein-specific as well as more general vein developmental programs are initiated at various locations in response to different positional information.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	21	Wing vein development in Drosophila can be subdivided into two temporally distinct stages: initiation and differentiation.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Vein initiation begins during the mid-third larval instar (Waddington, 1940; Garcia-Bellido, 1977; Garcia-Bellido and de Celis, 1992; Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 1993; Sturtevant and Bier, 1995; Bier, 2000) when the wing imaginal disc is a monolayer of cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The wing blade proper derives from an oval region of the wing disc known as the wing pouch, while the remainder of the disc generates elements of the wing hinge and thoracic body wall.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Vein differentiation, the second phase of vein development, occurs during metamorphosis as the wing disc buds out (or everts), folding along the future wing margin.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Ultimately, this eversion leads to the apposition of the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing during pupal development, creating the bilayer of cells comprising the mature wing blade.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	27	Genes involved in initiating wing vein development (vein genes) are expressed during the third larval instar in narrow stripes, corresponding to vein primordia, or in broader `provein' stripes, consisting of cells that are competent to become vein cells (Biehs et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Some vein genes are expressed in all vein primordia, while others are expressed in subsets of veins or in single veins.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	29	 For example rhomboid (rho), which encodes an integral membrane protein (Bier et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	30	, 1996), is expressed in all vein primordia and promotes vein formation throughout wing development by locally activating the Egfr signaling pathway (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	31	, 1994; Bier, 1998a; Bier, 1998b; Guichard et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	32	 caupolican (caup) and the neighboring gene araucan (ara) encode related homeobox genes that promote expression of other vein genes such as rho in odd numbered veins.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Proneural genes such as achaete (ac) and scute (sc) promote neural development in the L1 and L3 primordium (Gomez-Skarmata et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Delta (Dl) encodes a ligand for the Notch (N) receptor, which mediates lateral inhibitory interactions among cells in vein-competent domains during pupal development (Shellenbarger and Mohler, 1978; Kooh et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	35	, 1993; Parody and Muskavitch, 1993).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Delta is also expressed earlier during larval stages of wing development in all longitudinal veins except L2, and is likely to play a role in limiting vein thickness at this stage as well, since loss of Notch function during larval development leads to greatly broadened expression of the vein marker rho (Sturtevant and Bier, 1995).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	37	 kni and knrl, which encode related zinc finger transcription factors in the steroid hormone superfamily (Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	38	, 1989), are expressed in a single stripe corresponding to the L2 primordium beginning in the mid-third larval instar, and are required to initiate L2 development (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	39	 kni also functions as a gap gene in early embryonic development (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	40	The L2 stripe of kni/knrl-expressing cells forms along the anterior border of a broad domain of cells expressing high levels of the related and functionally overlapping spalt-major (salm) (Kuhnlein et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	41	, 1994) and spalt-related (salr) (Barrio et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	42	, 1996) zinc finger transcription factors.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A variety of evidence indicates that central domain cells expressing the patterning genes salm and salr (together referred to as sal) induce their anterior neighbors, which express very low levels of sal, to become the L2 primordium (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For example, in wings containing salm-mutant clones, ectopic branches of L2 are induced that track along and inside the salm- clone borders, mimicking the normal situation in which an L2 vein forms just outside the domain of high-level sal-expressing cells (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This ability of sal-expressing cells to induce their anterior low-level sal-expressing neighbors to initiate L2 development requires the activity of the kni locus (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The induction of kni/knrl expression in the L2 primordium therefore provides an excellent system for studying the transition from spatial patterning to tissue morphogenesis.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	47	Once activated along the anterior sal border, kni and knrl organize development of the L2 vein, in part by activating expression of the key vein-promoting gene rho and by suppressing expression of the intervein gene blistered (bs) (Montagne et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The kni locus is highly selective in regulating downstream gene expression in the L2 primordium as revealed by the observation that several genes expressed in other veins, such as caup and ara, ac and sc, and Delta, are excluded from the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, the kni locus links patterning to vein-specific morphogenesis by functioning downstream of sal and upstream of genes involved in vein versus intervein development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	50	The role of the kni locus in L2 formation has been clarified by analysis of likely regulatory alleles of the kni locus, previously known as radius incompletus (ri) (Arajarvi and Hannah-Alava, 1969; Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Flies with this mutation lack large sections of the L2 vein.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	52	 kniri mutants are homozygous viable, in contrast to kni null mutants, which die as embryos with a gap gene phenotype (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980; Nauber et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In support of kniri mutations being wing-specific regulatory alleles of the kni/knrl locus, expression of kni and knrl in the L2 primordium is absent in kniri[1] mutants, and the L2 vein-loss phenotype can be partially rescued by ubiquitous expression of kni in the wing (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	54	The findings summarized above suggest that kni and knrl organize the L2 vein developmental program by orchestrating expression of genes that execute distinct subsets of functions required for proper L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Several important unanswered questions remain, including: what function(s) are disrupted in kniri[1] and other existing kniri mutants?; do these mutations eliminate the function of an L2-specific cis-regulatory element in the kni locus?; and finally, with respect to the definition of L2 versus other veins, is it important to exclude expression of genes expressed in veins other than the L2 primordium?.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	56	In this study we report the identification of an enhancer element upstream of the kni coding region that selectively directs gene expression in the L2 primordium in third instar larval wing discs.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	57	 We show that three separate ri alleles have defects mapping within a minimal 1.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	58	 We demonstrate that two of these mutations eliminate activity of the L2 enhancer, kniri[1], which contains a 252 bp deletion, and kniri[53j], which harbors a single base-pair substitution.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	59	 We find that truncation of the minimal L2 enhancer to a 0.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	60	69 kb fragment leads to ectopic reporter gene expression in the extreme anterior and posterior regions of the wing, indicating that repression contributes to restricting activation of the L2 enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In addition, we show that the general wing promoting transcription factor Scalloped (Sd) binds with high affinity to several sites in the L2 enhancer and that sd is required for kni expression in the wing disc.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	62	 We have also employed the L2 enhancer element as a tool to drive expression of various UAS transgenes in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	63	 We find that the loss of the L2 vein in ri mutants can be rescued by L2-specific expression of either the kni or knrl genes, or the downstream target gene rho.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In addition, we find that misexpression of genes in the L2 primordium that are normally expressed in veins other than L2 results in abnormal L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These results provide a framework for understanding how positional information is converted into morphogenesis of the L2 wing vein by `vein organizing genes' such as kni and knrl.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	134	   RESULTS TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   An L2 enhancer element lies upstream of the knirps coding region In a previous study, we presented genetic evidence that the kniri[1] mutation, as well as an approximately 50 kb deletion of kni upstream sequences (Df(3L)kniri[XT2]), disrupt the function of a wing-specific regulatory element in the kni locus that is responsible for driving expression of the kni and knrl genes in the L2 primordium (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	135	 As a consequence of the loss of kni/knrl expression, kniri[1] (Fig.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	137	 As a first step in extending these studies, we gathered and characterized four other putative independently generated viable ri alleles of the kni locus, which lack portions of the L2 vein, including kniri[53j] (Fig.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	139	 As in kniri[1] wing discs, we found that kni expression is eliminated in the L2 primordium of each of these kniri alleles (data not shown).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	140	The studies mentioned above suggested that there might be an L2-specific wing vein enhancer that controls expression of kni and knrl in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We searched for such an enhancer element in two ways.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	367	, 1999), we observed ectopic veins that were displaced from the endogenous L2 vein by a few cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	368	 The ability of secreted ligands, but not the top construct, to induce ectopic vein formation at a distance cannot be attributed simply to the latter being a weaker activator of Egfr signaling since UAS-top is considerably more effective at generating ectopic veins than UAS-vn when other wing-GAL4 drivers are used (e.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Formation of the L2 vein provides a potential paradigm for connecting patterning initiated by a morphogen (e.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	377	 In this study we have identified a cis-acting regulatory element that drives expression of the kni locus in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	378	 We found that three distinct mutations causing L2 vein truncations alter this regulatory element and that in at least two of these cases the mutations disrupt the function of the enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Dissection of this enhancer element indicates that a locally provided activating signal acts in conjunction with broadly distributed activating (sd dependent) and repressive systems to limit activation of the L2 enhancer to a sharp stripe of cells in the wing imaginal disc.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	380	 We also found that excluding expression of non L2 vein genes from the L2 primordium is essential for normal L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	381	ri mutants are L2-enhancer specific regulatory alleles of the kni locus The results described in this study demonstrate definitively that ri mutations are regulatory alleles of the kni locus disrupting the function of a cis-regulatory enhancer element that drives gene expression in the L2 primordium of wing imaginal discs.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	382	 A crucial line of evidence supporting this conclusion is that mutant versions of the L2 enhancer incorporating either the 252 bp deletion present in kniri[1] or the single base pair substitution present in kniri[53j] eliminate the ability of this element to direct gene expression in the L2 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	383	 In addition, it is possible to completely rescue the vein-loss phenotype of kniri[1] by expressing either the UAS-kni or UAS-knrl transgenes with an L2-GAL4 driver.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Consistent with activation of rho being one of the key effectors of kni/knrl function, it is also possible to rescue the L2 vein-loss phenotype of kniri[1] by expressing a UAS-rho transgene in L2, although rescue is less complete and penetrant than that observed with UAS-kni or UAS-knrl.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	385	The isolation of the L2 enhancer also addresses an unresolved question regarding the basis for the failure of Df(3L)kniri[XT2] and Df(3L)kniFC82 to complement (Lunde et al.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	390	 The alternative explanation for the ri phenotype of Df(3L)kniri[XT2]/Df(3L)kniFC82 is that transvection (Lewis, 1954; Geyer et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	391	, 1990; Pirrotta, 1999), which normally occurs between regulatory and coding region alleles of the kni locus (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	392	, 1998), is interrupted by the large divergent deletions that have little if any overlap.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	396	, 1998), the latter hypothesis that Df(3L)kniri[XT2] and Df(3L)kniFC82 are unable to engage in effective transvection is the most likely explanation for the failure of these two mutations to complement.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	397	Global activation, regional repression and localized induction restrict L2-enhancer activity to a narrow stripe of cells The results of these and previous studies of L2 vein initiation lead to a model in which localized vein inductive signaling acts against a background of regional repression and global wing-specific activation (Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Previous genetic experiments have suggested a model in which sal-expressing cells produce a short-range L2 inducing signal (X) to which sal-expressing cells themselves cannot respond (Sturtevant et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	399	 According to this `for export only' signaling model, the signal X diffuses into adjacent anterior cells and activates expression of the kni/knrl genes in the L2 primordium, in much the same fashion as Hh, expressed from the refractory posterior compartment, activates expression of target genes such as dpp or ptc in the anterior compartment (reviewed by Bier, 2000).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Based on the analysis of the L2 enhancer element described in this study, the 252 bp region deleted in kniri[1] mutants may contain response element(s) to this putative factor X.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	401	 It is worth noting, however, that lacZ expression is lost in all cells of the wing disc (posterior and circumferential cells as well as the L2 primordium) when these sequences are deleted from the 4.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	402	 This observation suggests that sequences mediating more general activation (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	403	 Sd binding sites, see below) may also be contained within this 252 bp region.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	404	 The sequence surrounding the single nucleotide alteration in kniri[53j] mutants (C596A), however, is a particularly intriguing candidate for mediating the L2-specific activation of kni since introducing this mutation in the context of the minimal 1.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	407	 7B) that binds to the region surrounding the kniri[53j] point mutation and mediates the inductive signal X presumably collaborates with the more generally required wing selector Sd (Halder et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	408	, 2001), since mutation of four of the Sd binding sites (the doublet and two single sites) in the L2 activation domain completely eliminates enhancer activity in the wing disc.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Clonal analysis with a hypomorphic sd allele also indicates that sd is required for high-level expression of the full 4.

0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	411	 It is notable that the reduction in lacZ expression in these clones is not as dramatic as the complete loss of L2 activity observed when Sd binding sites in the activation domain are mutated.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	412	 There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Firstly, the sd mutation used in these experiments is a hypomorphic allele and therefore has residual activity.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Unfortunately, stronger sd alleles produce even smaller viable clones in the wing disc and thus were not used.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Secondly, as only small clones can be generated, they must typically have been produced with only two or three intervening cycles of cell division.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Consequently, the sd  cells may still contain functional levels of wild type Sd (protein perdurance).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Another possibility is that other activators can partially substitute for Sd, at least in certain regions of the wing.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Based on the absence of L2 activity when Sd binding sites are mutated and the reduction in L2 activity in sd  hypomorphic clones, we conclude that Sd plays an important role as an activator of the L2 enhancer.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	419	 These results support the view that Sd functions as a general transcriptional activator of genes expressed in the wing field.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	420	Repression also plays a key role in restricting L2 enhancer expression to a narrow stripe of wing disc cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	421	 It has been shown previously that salm and salr, which are expressed strongly in the central region of the wing, repress expression of kni and knrl (Lunde et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	422	, 1998), although low levels of sal may also be required to activate kni expression (de Celis and Barrio, 2000).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	423	 In the current study we also find evidence for repression of L2-enhancer activity in peripheral wing disc cells abutting those expressing high levels of sal.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	424	4 kb (fragment EX) L2 enhancer element results in reporter gene expression expanding to fill the anterior and posterior regions of the wing pouch in a pattern complementary to that of sal.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	425	 The region deleted from the EX fragment contains several consensus binding sites for Brinker (Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	426	, 2001), which may mediate this repression since the pattern of brinker (brk) expression in the wing pouch (Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999; Jazwinska et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	427	, 1999) is very similar to that of lacZ expression driven by the 0.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	428	 One way to integrate the action of the localized inductive signal XX' pathway with that of abutting central and peripheral repressive factors is to propose that the signal-dependent activator X' can overcome the repressive action of the peripheral inhibitor but not repression by Salm/Salr (see legend to Fig.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	429	 One feature common to several prominent signaling pathways is that activation of the pathway converts a resting repressor into a transcriptional activator (Barolo and Posakony, 2002).
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	430	 In the kni L2 enhancer, activation of the hypothetical signal X pathway may relieve repression by a heterologous repressor since the putative activator (i.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Brk?) sequences in the L2 enhancer are separable.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	432	 One example of a signaling pathway that functions by relieving inhibition by a heterologous repressor is the recent report of Egfr signaling inactivating repression by Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) (Tsuda et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	433	 In addition to central and peripheral repression in the wing disc, there may also be a repressor in posterior compartment cells (e.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	434	 7A,B) to prevent activation of the L2 enhancer in cells posterior to the sal expression domain.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	435	8 kb L2 enhancer element lacks some sites for this putative repressor since E-lacZ drives significantly higher levels of gene expression in the posterior stripe than that observed for endogenous kni or knrl expression.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	436	Expression of non-L2 vein genes must be excluded from the L2 primordium All longitudinal veins share several morphological characteristics such as being composed of densely packed cells on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing that secrete a thickened cuticle.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	437	 The primordia of all longitudinal veins also express the rhomboid gene, which is required for activating the Egfr pathway in vein but not in intervein cells.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	438	 In addition to these shared properties, each vein can be distinguished by expression of other vein genes (Biehs et al.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	439	 For example, vein L2-specific characteristics include: expression of kni and knrl, lack of Delta expression, lack of cauplara expression, and lack of ac/sc expression.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Given that all veins are ultimately quite similar morphologically, it is relevant to ask whether the differences in gene expression patterns observed in different veins are important.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	441	In this study, we examined the necessity of excluding expression of non-L2 vein genes in the L2 primordium by forcing expression of genes such as Dl, ara, ac and sc in L2 and asking whether this manipulation had any impact on L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	442	 These experiments strongly suggest that exclusion of non-L2 vein genes from the L2 primordium is indeed important since misexpression of each of these genes resulted in abnormal L2 development.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	443	 The phenotypes resulting from misexpressing non-L2 vein genes in the L2 primordium can largely be reconciled with the normal functions of these genes.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	444	 For example, forced expression of Dl leads to loss of L2, consistent with suppression of vein formation by Notch signaling.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	445	 The ectopic bristles that form strictly along the L2 vein in wings misexpressing ac or sc are also consistent with the neural promoting function of proneural genes.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	446	 It is less clear why misexpression of the ara gene causes thinning of the L2 primordium, since this gene normally activates expression of the vein-promoting gene rho in odd numbered veins and ac and sc in the L3 primordium.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	447	 Perhaps expression of a gene normally involved in development of the odd numbered dorsal veins is somehow incompatible with development of the ventral L2 vein.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	448	The L2 expression system provides a localized assay for gene function in the wing The sharp stripe of gene expression driven by L2-GAL4 can also be used as a rapid assay to test the function or range of action of various genes in the wing.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	449	 For example, in the case of the Egfr pathway, it is possible to distinguish components exerting cell-autonomous versus non cell-autonomous functions.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	450	 In line with the fact that activation of the Egfr pathway in the wing leads to the formation of veins, L2-GAL4-driven expression of the secreted ligand sSpi generates ectopic veins in the neighborhood of L2 while expression of the equally potent constitutively active top form of the EGF receptor does not result in a non-autonomous phenotype.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	451	 The L2 expression system may also be used to compare the functions of related genes such as the nuclear receptors Kni, Knrl, and Eg.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Although these three transcription factors share nearly identical DNA binding domains and can all rescue the vein-loss phenotype of ri mutants, they differ in that misexpression of eg in the L2 primordium induces the formation of ectopic bristles along L2.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	453	 This distinct activity of eg may relate to its normal embryonic function in directing cell fate choices in the CNS.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	454	 Using the L2 expression system as an assay, it should be straightforward to map the domain in eg that is responsible for its neural inducing capacity by constructing chimeric molecules composed of different domains of Eg and Kni.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Finally, the observation that L2-driven expression of Dl leads to a highly penetrant loss of L2 in males and a consistently weaker phenotype in females provides the basis for a modifier screen to identify mutations that either suppress the phenotype in males or enhance the phenotype in females.
0.22649837.12466192.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Some of the modifier loci identified in such a screen, which are not specifically involved in Notch signaling, may encode components of the hypothesized factor XX' pathway.

0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	8	 There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we report that the herpes simplex virus outer capsid protein VP26 interacts with dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 and is sufficient to mediate retrograde transport of viral capsids in a cellular model.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A library of herpes simplex virus capsid and tegument structural genes was constructed and tested for interactions with dynein subunits in a yeast two-hybrid system.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A strong interaction was detected between VP26 and the homologous 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In vitro pull-down assays confirmed binding of VP26 to RP3, Tctex1, and intact cytoplasmic dynein complexes.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Recombinant herpes simplex virus capsids were constructed either with or without VP26.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In pull-down assays VP26+ capsids bound to RP3; VP26-capsids did not.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To investigate intracellular transport, the recombinant viral capsids were microinjected into living cells and incubated at 37  degrees C.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	16	 After 1 h VP26+ capsids were observed to co-localize with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	17	 After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, whereas VP26-capsids remained in a random distribution.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We propose that VP26 mediates binding of incoming herpes simplex virus capsids to cytoplasmic dynein during cellular infection, through interactions with dynein light chains.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	19	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)1 infects 40 to 80% of people worldwide and can cause potentially fatal meningoencephalitis in adults or disseminated infection in neonates, in addition to common mucocutaneous disease.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	20	 After inoculation of the skin or mucous membrane, HSV-1 is transported along sensory axons in a retrograde direction to the neuronal cell body, where it establishes life-long latent infection.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Periodic reactivation results in HSV-1 being transported in an anterograde direction to nerve terminals, where it causes recurrent clinical disease or asymptomatic viral shedding (1).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	22	The double-stranded DNA virus HSV-1 has a 1250-A icosahedral protein capsid, surrounded by a less structured protein tegument layer, in turn surrounded by a lipid envelope containing several glycoproteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The major capsid proteins VP5, VP19C, VP23, and VP26 are self-assembling when expressed in vitro using recombinant baculoviruses (2, 3).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	24	During infection, HSV-1 binds to cell surface receptors (via glycoproteins), enters the cell by membrane fusion, then most but not all tegument proteins dissociate from the nucleocapsid after phosphorylation (4, 5).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The nucleocapsid-tegument complex is transported to the outer nuclear membrane where it docks and releases viral DNA into the nucleus, but the capsid itself does not enter the nucleus (6).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	26	 There is evidence that the rapid "retrograde" transport of this complex to the cell nucleus involves microtubules and is mediated by the minus-end-directed molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein (7 to 9).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Retrograde transport of the closely related alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been observed in live cells to be saltatory, with brief, rapid transport events (10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The herpes viral proteins that mediate retrograde transport are unknown but are likely to involve outer capsid or inner tegument proteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In support of this, HSV-1 capsids, stripped of envelope and much of the tegument protein by detergent lysis, move in a retrograde direction after injection into giant squid axons (11).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The site of attachment for the dynein complex on the capsid has not been confirmed.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	31	Cytoplasmic dynein is a large (1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	32	2 MDa) complex, with heavy chains providing motive force, whereas intermediate and light chains contribute to cargo binding (12).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Regulation of dynein function is not well understood but is thought to involve the multisubunit complex dynactin, which is also involved in binding membranous cargo (13).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Light chain LC8 has been reported to interact with proteins from rabies virus (14, 15), African swine fever virus (16), human adenovirus, vaccinia virus, and human papillomavirus (17), whereas Tctex1 interacts with the poliovirus receptor CD155 (18).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Despite a recently reported interaction between dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and HSV-1 protein UL34 (19), its role in retrograde transport has yet to be confirmed.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The protein product of UL34 is absent from mature virions in HSV-1 (20) and PRV (21).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, deletion of UL34 from HSV-1 does not prevent infection of cells (22).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	38	Previous work in our laboratory has concentrated on anterograde axonal transport of HSV-1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We have shown that newly formed HSV-1 capsids, having acquired much of their tegument in the neuron cell body (23), are transported in an anterograde direction along axons, separate from glycoproteins (24, 25).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Similar observations have been made for PRV (26).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Fast anterograde, microtubule-dependent transport is mediated by the kinesin family of molecular motors (27).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We have shown previously (28) that the HSV-1 tegument protein US11 interacts with the ubiquitous heavy chain of the kinesin motor KIF5B and is likely to play an important role in anterograde axonal transport.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	43	By using a similar approach for retrograde transport, we report an interaction between the HSV-1 capsid protein VP26 and 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	44	 These light chains are 55% homologous at the amino acid level and are mutually exclusive in cytoplasmic dynein complexes (29 to 31).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We propose that VP26 mediates binding of the HSV-1 nucleocapsid to cytoplasmic dynein, via interactions with RP3 and probably Tctex1, during retrograde axonal transport of virus in neurons as well as during infection of non-neuronal cells.

0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	252	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Our results suggest that the binding of HSV-1 outer capsid protein VP26 to dynein light chains RP3, and probably Tctex1, is important in the retrograde transport of viral capsids toward the cell nucleus during infection.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	253	Cytoplasmic dynein is the major minus-end-directed, microtubule-associated molecular motor, and each dynein complex contains two copies of the same 14-kDa light chain, either RP3 or Tctex1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The two chains, although 55% homologous at the amino acid level (30), are mutually exclusive in each complex, compete for binding sites on DIC, and have differing binding specificities (31).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	255	We initially demonstrated binding of VP26 to dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 in a yeast two-hybrid system, and we confirmed strong expression of the -galactosidase reporter by quantitative assay.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Subsequent work confirmed binding of recombinant, soluble VP26 to RP3 and Tctex1 in vitro, using bacterial expression and GST pull-down assays.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We also confirmed that immobilized His6-VP26 is able to bind to intact cytoplasmic dynein complexes in cell lysates.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Most important, we have confirmed binding of dynein (RP3) to VP26 in its biologically relevant form as part of a recombinant viral capsid bound to VP5.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	259	Thus we have confirmed specific binding of VP26 to dynein light chain RP3 in three separate assays, including as part of a viral capsid.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	260	 This suggests that the binding of VP26 to RP3 utilizes different VP26 epitopes from those involved in binding to VP5 in capsids (49) and is consistent with the interaction playing a significant role in vivo.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Furthermore, in microinjected cells we have shown co-localization of HSV-1 capsids containing VP26 with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules, further supporting a functional role for VP26-dynein interactions.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	262	Despite strong interaction between VP26 and Tctex1 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro pull-down assays (using His6-VP26), and co-localization of HSV-1 capsids with Tctex1, we were unable to confirm binding of VP26+ capsids to Tctex1 in vitro.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	263	 We believe that this result most likely reflects a lower sensitivity for this particular assay, in light of the other in vitro binding results.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The ability to bind either RP3 or Tctex1 would be expected to offer HSV-1 an evolutionary advantage, by allowing retrograde transport of HSV-1 capsids on any cytoplasmic dynein complex in all cell types.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	265	 We cannot exclude that recombinant Tctex1 may only bind to soluble VP26 in vitro and not to VP26 incorporated into recombinant HSV-1 capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	266	 However, the co-localization of VP26+ capsids with Tctex1 in live cells suggests that VP26 interacts with Tctex1, as well as RP3, in this more biologically relevant model.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	267	HSV-1 readily infects mucous membranes in both adults and children, before being transported in a retrograde direction along neuronal axons to establish latent infection.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	268	 RP3 in particular is an attractive candidate to mediate this retrograde transport, as it is expressed at high levels in cells infected by HSV-1, including adult brain and many other tissue types, whereas Tctex1 is expressed predominantly in fetal tissue and testis (30).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Furthermore, it has been proposed that RP3-containing dynein complexes play the predominant role during retrograde transport from post-synaptic nerve terminals (29), the site of HSV-1 entry.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	270	VP26, at the hexon tips, is ideally located to interact with molecular motors (48), because most of the tegument is lost soon after cell entry (6).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Tegument proteins VP11/12, VP13/14, VP16, and VP22 are known to dissociate from the virus at early stages of infection, whereas the major tegument protein VP1/2 and the minor capsid protein UL25 probably remain attached to incoming capsids (4, 5, 8, 50, 51).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	272	 VP1/2 appears to attach to capsids at the vertical pentons (52), whereas VP26 is found exclusively on hexons (39, 48, 53) and does not interfere with capsid-tegument interaction (54).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This specific binding is probably due to differing orientations of the upper domain of VP5, the structure of which has recently been solved (55).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	274	Binding of the tegument protein VP11/12 to RP3 and Tctex1 was detected in the yeast two-hybrid system but could not be confirmed with pull-down assays due to poor expression of soluble His6 tag fusion proteins in E.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The significance of these results is unclear, but any role is likely to be later in the viral replication cycle, rather than during retrograde transport.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It seems unlikely that VP11/12 is involved in retrograde transport of the capsid-tegument complex, because it dissociates from incoming capsids during cell infection (50), although retention of some residual VP11/12 during retrograde transport will be difficult to exclude.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	277	 An interaction of VP11/12 with dynein may play a role during tegument assembly, however, because newly synthesized VP11/12 has been observed in perinuclear particles undergoing rapid, microtubule-dependent movement (50).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	278	To confirm that the interaction between VP26 and dynein is important for cellular transport, recombinant viral capsids were microinjected into living cells.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	279	 On average there was significant movement of VP26+ capsids toward the cell nucleus after 2 or 4 h, which was absent for VP26-capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	280	 VP26-capsids in fact redistributed slightly toward the cell periphery, but this may simply reflect diffusion to a truly "random" distribution.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These results therefore suggest an important role for VP26 during retrograde transport, through interactions with cytoplasmic dynein.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	282	The relative contribution of other tegument or capsid proteins to HSV-1 transport is unclear and requires further study.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We cannot exclude that VP1/2, or one of the minor capsid proteins such as UL25, may also contribute to dynein binding in vivo, as suggested by others (8, 10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Any binding of these or other HSV-1 proteins to dynein would imply redundancy in viral proteins available for retrograde transport, and may explain why VP26 is not an essential protein for replication in vitro (56).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Redundancy for such an important process may be advantageous for the virus, and there are precedents for functional redundancy in other HSV-1 proteins (57).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	286	 In our yeast two-hybrid system there was no evidence of interaction between dynein and a large fragment of VP1/2 (N-terminal two-thirds), but it was not possible to clone the rest of the protein.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Neither was it possible to test UL25 in our system for possible interaction with RP3 or Tctex1, due to autoactivation.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	288	The role of VP26 during viral transport in vivo remains to be determined.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	289	 There has been one previous study, in a mouse eye model, dissecting the role of VP26 in retrograde transport of HSV-1 to, and replication in, trigeminal ganglia (56).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Deletion of VP26 decreased the amount of infectious virus in trigeminal ganglia by 100-fold, whereas titers in cell culture (where retrograde transport is less critical) were decreased only 2-fold.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Simultaneous deletion of thymidine kinase (and thus replication) ablated the effects of VP26 deletion at 72 h after ocular infection, suggesting the virus could still be transported in the absence of VP26.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, earlier time points may be needed to detect a decrease in transport velocity or efficiency, because wild-type virus can arrive as early as 19 h postinfection (58).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	293	In our current study we set out to determine the viral and cellular proteins that mediate retrograde axonal transport of HSV-1.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Our use of protein-protein interaction assays and minimal recombinant capsids should be a more sensitive way to detect HSV-dynein interactions than traditional approaches, relying on single gene null mutants, which can miss important interactions where multifunctional or redundant proteins exist (10).
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	295	We have demonstrated by two different assays that VP26 binds to dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 in vitro, and we confirmed binding of VP26 to intact dynein complexes.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	296	 We have demonstrated co-localization in cells of micro-injected HSV-1 capsids with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	297	 We have shown further that VP26 in its biologically relevant form is able to mediate binding of recombinant HSV-1 capsids to RP3 in vitro, in the absence of minor capsid or tegument proteins.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Finally, we have shown that VP26, incorporated into recombinant capsids, is both necessary and sufficient to mediate retrograde intracellular transport of capsids.
0.21750095.15117959.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We therefore propose that VP26, although not essential for viral replication in vitro, is likely to be one of two or more HSV proteins mediating retrograde axonal transport in vivo, perhaps another example of redundancy for key viral functions.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	2	Herpes simplex virus 1 fuses with the plasma membrane of a host cell, and the incoming capsids are efficiently and rapidly transported across the cytosol to the nuclear pore complexes, where the viral DNA genomes are released into the nucleoplasm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Using biochemical assays, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy in the presence and absence of microtubule depolymerizing agents, it was shown that the cytosolic capsid transport in Vero cells was mediated by microtubules.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Antibody labeling revealed the attachment of dynein, a minus end-directed, microtubule-dependent motor, to the viral capsids.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We propose that the incoming capsids bind to microtubules and use dynein to propel them from the cell periphery to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	6	The entry of animal viruses into their host cells involves adsorption to cell surface receptors, penetration into the cytosol, and uncoating of the viral genome.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	7	 For viruses that replicate in the nucleus, entry also entails extensive movement of viruses and viral capsids through the cytoplasm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Transport over long distances is particularly critical for viruses that infect neurons in which the site of entry can be located far from the cell body and the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	9	Since movement of virus-sized particles through the cytosol is not likely to occur by free diffusion due to high viscosity and steric obstacles (Bray, 1992; Luby-Phelps, 1994), viruses most likely exploit the cell's motile functions for transport.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The limited information available suggests that viruses can make use of both microtubules (MT)1 and actin filaments.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	11	 EM analysis has shown MT binding of certain viral capsids, such as adenovirus and reovirus in vivo and in vitro (for review see Luftig, 1982) as well as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in neurons (Lycke et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Way and co-workers have described actin filament-dependent intra- and intercellular transport of vaccinia virus during egress from cells (Cudmore et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Moreover, many viruses take advantage of the retrograde movement of endocytic organelles during entry.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	14	 They are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and carried within coated vesicles and endosomes from the cell periphery toward the perinuclear area of the cell (see Greber et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 1994; Marsh and Helenius, 1989).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	16	In this study we have focused on the intracytosolic transport of incoming HSV-1 capsids in Vero cells.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HSV-1 has three structural components: capsid, tegument, and envelope.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The capsid consists of the viral DNA of 152 kbp and a proteinaceous shell comprising six different proteins; it has a diameter of 125 nm, and the proteins are arranged in an icosahedron formed by 12 pentons and 150 hexons (Booy et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	19	, 1974; Spear and Roizman, 1972).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	20	 VP5 constitutes the major protein component of both hexons and pentons (Newcomb et al.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Capsids of intact virions, either extracellular (Fig.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	430	5% of all capsids present in virions had colloidal gold particles in close proximity (Table I).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Thus, the labeling density was eightfold higher on cytosolic capsids compared with capsids within virions, ruling out the possibility that the antidynein antibody showed cross-reactivity to capsid proteins.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	432	 Given that the labeling efficiency using this technique does not exceed 10%, e.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	433	, only 10% of the primary antibody present on the sections is detected by protein A-gold (Griffiths, 1993a), these results showed that incoming cytosolic viral capsids associated with cytoplasmic dynein.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	435	 It infects epithelial cells of mucocutaneous membranes, and, as other  herpesviridae, it establishes latent infections in sensory ganglia (Whitley and Gnann, 1993).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	436	 It is thought to enter neurons by fusion at the presynaptic membrane, after which the capsid is transported along the axon to the nucleus (Hill et al.

0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	438	 The efficient infection of neurons and other terminally differentiated cells has made HSV-1 a useful vehicle for gene delivery with potential for gene therapy in the human brain (Glorioso et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	439	The biochemical and morphological assays used in our study showed that HSV-1 entry into Vero cells is both rapid and efficient.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Over a broad range of multiplicities, we found that ~70% of bound virus penetrated with a half-time of ~8 min.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	441	 More than 60% of the capsids delivered to the cytosol were transported to the nucleus within 4 h of uptake, and binding to fibers extending from the nuclear pore complexes seemed to occur.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	442	 The ratio of particles to plaque-forming units for HSV-1 is between 10 and 50 (Frenkel et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	443	, 1992; Smith, 1964; Watson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	444	 Thus, if cells were infected at an MOI of 50, and 40% of these bound, the number of particles entering the cells was 140-700 according to the proteinase K assay.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	445	 We determined that 60% of the internalized virus, namely 80-420 particles, uncoat their viral genome within 4 h postinfection as measured by a DNase protection assay (Ojala, P.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	446	 Helenius, manuscript in preparation).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	447	A majority of the capsids remained associated with nuclear pores after releasing their DNA (see also Batterson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	448	 The apparent transient stability of the empty capsids contrasts with adenovirus, another virus that delivers its DNA to the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes, for which no empty capsids could be detected at the nuclear pore complexes (Greber et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	449	 We cannot formally rule out that, even though the herpes capsids appeared empty at the nuclear membrane, viral DNA release had not been completed yet.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	450	Our results demonstrate that MT are involved in capsid transport from the cell surface to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Since the distance from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in Vero cells is not as large as in neurons, MT-assisted transport was not essential for infection, but it accelerated both the transfer of the capsids to the nucleus and the onset of viral protein synthesis.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Having first detached from most of the tegument proteins at the plasma membrane, the capsids moved in minus end direction along MT to the MTOC.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	453	 From there, they were transferred to the nuclear pores by unknown mechanisms.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	454	 At early times (1-2 h PI), the majority of the capsids associated with the nuclear membrane proximal to the MTOC, but later the distribution became more homogenous around the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	455	Nocodazole and colchicine, which both depolymerize MT, and vinblastine, which causes MT paracrystal formation, reduced capsid accumulation at the nuclear envelope.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	456	 These drugs were also reported to reduce the amount of infectious HSV-1 recovered from rat dorsal root ganglia infected in vitro (Kristensson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	457	, 1986) and from the trigeminal ganglia after inoculation of the murine cornea (Topp et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	458	 We think that it is very likely that capsids derived from virions bound to the "apical" plasma membrane in our system (see Fig.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	459	 5 a) reached the nucleus independent of MT, since the distance between the apical plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane is only ~200-300 nm.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	460	 Thus, the larger the distance between the plasma membrane where the virion had bound and the nucleus, the more the transport to the nucleus depended on MT.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	461	 In contrast with the results obtained in neurons (Kristensson et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	462	, 1986), taxol, which stabilizes MT, did not reduce the efficiency of capsid transport, suggesting that the dynamic turnover or "treadmilling" of MT was not required for capsid transport in Vero cells.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D had no effect either on HSV-1 internalization or transport to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	464	The presence of dynein heavy chains in the material attached to the cytosolic capsids indicated that the MT-mediated transport was powered by cytoplasmic dynein.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	465	 Cytoplasmic dynein is a multisubunit protein complex of 1,270 kD consisting of two heavy chains, two to three intermediate chains, and a variable number of small subunits (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	466	 It has a length of ~40-50 nm and a shape reminiscent of the letter Y.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	467	 The two head domains contain the MT binding and ATPase sites, while the base interacts with the cargo (Gilbert and Sloboda, 1989; Vale, 1990; Vallee et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	468	 Dynein is responsible for minus end-directed movement of chromosomes and membrane organelles along MT (Cole and LippincottSchwartz, 1995; Mitchison, 1988).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	469	 Since the plus ends of MT are localized in the periphery of Vero cells close to the plasma membrane and the minus ends are anchored at the perinuclear MTOC, dynein seems a logical choice as a motor for the transport of incoming viral capsids to the nucleus.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	470	 The same applies to the axons of neurons, where the MT have their plus ends toward the synapse, and the minus end anchored at the MTOC in the cell body (Black and Baas, 1989).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Although some kinesin-like MT minus end-directed motors have been implicated to play a role in mitosis and meiosis, none of them has been demonstrated to be involved in interphase transport processes (Barton and Goldstein, 1996; Hirokawa, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	472	 Since the MT-mediated transport that is crucial for infection of neurons also operates in cultured fibroblasts, its analysis will be greatly facilitated.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	473	It is believed that dynein attachment to vesicles and kinetochores requires another large multimeric complex, called dynactin, which contains 10 different proteins (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994; Schroer, 1994; Vallee and Sheetz, 1996).
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	474	 So far, receptor molecules for dynein and dynactin have not been identified on any cargo structures, but several studies indicate that the activity of dynein and its binding to cargo may be regulated by phosphorylation (Allen, 1995; Dillman and Pfister, 1994; Lin et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	475	 Whether the binding of dynein to HSV-1 capsids involves dynactin or other cellular components and whether it is regulated by phosphorylation remains unclear at this point.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	476	 The viral protein(s) that serve as dynein receptors also remain to be identified.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Since the polypeptide composition of the capsids and tegument is known, some potential candidates can, however, be singled out.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	478	 The capsid itself contains six different proteins.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	479	 Of these, only VP5 is known to be located at the pentons (Trus et al.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	480	, 1992), which were the sites of preferential attachment of proteinaceous material onto cytosolic capsids shown here.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	481	 In addition to the bona fide capsid polypeptides, components derived from the tegument are also likely to be present.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	482	 For example, VP1-2, a 270-kD protein, is particularly tightly associated with the capsids (Roizman and Furlong, 1974) and may constitute part of the material seen attached to the pentons in our electron micrographs.
0.26717928.9060466.html.plaintext.txt	483	 Taking advantage of the relative simplicity of the capsids, of existing virus mutants, and of the complete genomic sequence of the virus, work is in progress to identify and to characterize the dynein receptor in HSV-1 capsids.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	4	To conserve carbohydrate reserves, the reaction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) must be down-regulated when the citric acid cycle is provided sufficient acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	5	 PDC activity is reduced primarily through increased phosphorylation of its pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component due to E1 kinase activity being markedly enhanced by elevated intramitochondrial NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A mechanism is evaluated in which enhanced kinase activity is facilitated by the build-up of the reduced and acetylated forms of the lipoyl moieties of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component through using NADH and acetyl-CoA in the reverse of the downstream reactions of the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Using a peptide substrate, kinase activity was stimulated by these products, ruling out the possibility kinase activity is increased due to changes in the reaction state of its substrate, E1 (thiamin pyrophosphate).
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Each E2 subunit contains two lipoyl domains, an NH-terminal (L1) and the inward lipoyl domain (L2), which were individually produced in fully lipoylated forms by recombinant techniques.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although reduction and acetylation of the L1 domain or free lipoamide increased kinase activity, those modifications of the lipoate of the kinase-binding L2 domain gave much greater enhancements of kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The large stimulation of the kinase generated by acetyl-CoA only occurred upon addition of the transacetylase-catalyzing (lipoyl domain-free) inner core portion of E2 plus a reduced lipoate source, affirming that acetylation of this prosthetic group is an essential mechanistic step for acetyl-CoA enhancing kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Similarly, the lesser stimulation of kinase activity by just NADH required a lipoate source, supporting the need for lipoate reduction by E3 catalysis.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	12	Complete enzymatic delipoylation of PDC, the E2-kinase subcomplex, or recombinant L2 abolished the stimulatory effects of NADH and acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Retention of a small portion of PDC lipoates lowered kinase activity but allowed stimulation of this residual kinase activity by these products.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Reintroduction of lipoyl moieties, using lipoyl protein ligase, restored the capacity of the E2 core to support high kinase activity along with stimulation of that activity up to 3-fold by NADH and acetyl-CoA.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	15	 As suggested by those results, the enhancement of kinase activity is very responsive to reductive acetylation with a half-maximal stimulation achieved with 20% of free L2 acetylated and, from an analysis of previous results, with acetylation of only 3-6 of the 60 L2 domains in intact PDC.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Based on these findings, we suggest that kinase stimulation results from modification of the lipoate of an L2 domain that becomes specifically engaged in binding the kinase.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In conclusion, kinase activity is attenuated through a substantial range in response to modest changes in the proportion of oxidized, reduced, and acetylated lipoyl moieties of the L2 domain of E2 produced by fluctuations in the NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios as translated by the rapid and reversible E3 and E2 reactions.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	18	In mammalian cells, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) ()controls the oxidative utilization of glucose(1) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Flux through this reaction results in a net depletion of body carbohydrate reserves.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The activity of PDC must be reduced when fatty acids or ketone bodies are being preferentially used to provide 2-carbon units for oxidative energy production by citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation systems, a routine situation in many organs.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Furthermore, under conditions of starvation or diabetes, the activity of PDC is reduced to a minimal level to conserve carbohydrates essential for the brain and other specialized tissues/organs.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	22	 To achieve its critical role in cellular fuel conservation, the PDC reaction is controlled primarily by a highly regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle which is carried out by dedicated kinase and phosphatase components.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component inactivates the complex and dephosphorylation reactivates the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	24	Shortly after PDC was shown to be regulated by this interconversion (2) , the capacity of fatty acids and ketone bodies to promote inactivation of PDC was demonstrated in intact tissues (3, 4) and in studies with intact mitochondria(5, 6) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Studies with purified complex (7, 8, 9) and isolated mitochondria (10, 11, 12) found that increases of the PDC reaction products promote an increase in the proportion of PDC in the phosphorylated (inactive) state.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	26	 With purified complex, the activity of the kinase is greatly enhanced upon elevation of the NADH:NAD ratio and the acetyl-CoA:CoA ratio along with a reciprocal reduction in phosphatase activity as the NADH:NAD ratio is elevated(7) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	27	Accordingly, the E1a kinase has a crucial role wherein it throttles down PDC activity in response to increases in the mitochondrial acetylation and reduction potentials.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Not only are NADH and acetyl-CoA produced during mitochondrial oxidation of all fuels, they are direct products of the PDC reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This laboratory presented evidence that this control of kinase activity initially involves these product to substrate ratios being translated by competitive utilization in the downstream reactions of the complex which, in turn, adjusts the fraction of the complex's lipoyl prosthetic groups in the oxidized versus reduced versus acetylated forms(13, 14, 15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Specifically, our mechanism proposes that kinase down-regulates PDC activity due to NADH reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) reaction and acetyl-CoA reacting in the reverse of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Typically a 60-80% enhancement in kinase activity occurs upon lipoate reduction and up to a 3-fold enhancement following lipoate acetylation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The potential for understanding the molecular basis of this control has greatly improved with new insights into the structure of E2 subunits and the unusual nature of the association of the kinase with E2.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	33	The E2 subunits of mammalian PDC have four domains connected by relatively large (2-3 kDa) and highly mobile linker regions Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Sixty COOH-terminal inner domains (E2) associate to form a dodecahedral inner core which catalyzes the transacetylation reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Each inner domain is connected to 3 globular domains by linker or hinge regions.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The globular domains consist of two 10-kDa lipoyl domains (E2 and E2, or L1 and L2) and an E1-binding domain (E2) located between the inner core and the lipoyl domain region.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	37	Figure 1: Domain structure of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component and interactions with the kinase and E1 components.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	38	 E2 has four globular domains consisting of an NH-terminal lipoyl domain, L1, an inner lipoyl domain, L2, an E1 binding domain, and a core-forming, transacetylase-catalyzing inner domain at the COOH-terminal end(18, 19, 20) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The kinase binds to the L2 domain by a domain-specific and lipoyl prosthetic group-requiring interaction(26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	40	 E1, an tetramer, binds to the B domain of E2 via its -subunit (18) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	41	The subunits of E1a kinases of PDC and the branched-chain -keto acid dehydrogenase complex are related to procaryotic histidine kinases but not to the extramitochondrial serine and tyrosine kinases of eukaryotes(21, 22, 23) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	42	 PDC kinase binds to the lipoyl domain region of E2 through an association that requires the lipoyl prosthetic group(24, 25, 26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Using lipoylated and delipoylated forms of recombinant L1 and L2 of human PDC-E2(27) , the kinase was shown to bind preferentially to the lipoylated L2 (Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The E1a kinase was also shown to interchange rapidly between L2 structures(26) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	45	 To account for tight binding and rapid interchange, a dynamic ``hand over hand'' mechanism is proposed in which a dimeric kinase alternates between being bound to one and two L2 domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This interchange and catalytic function of the kinase exert their combined effects in the limited space at the surface of the complex where the a kinase molecule and many E1 components are tightly bound to the mobile outer domains of E2.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The capacity of continuously bound kinase to phosphorylate bound E1 components more rapidly than free kinase can phosphorylate free E1 is termed E2-activated kinase function.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	48	The aim of this work is to determine the compulsory components, domains, and catalytic processes involved in kinase stimulation by NADH and acetyl-CoA, and to evaluate the relative capacities of the recombinant L1 and L2 in mediating the stimulation of kinase in the presence or absence of E2-activated kinase function.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We have found that stimulation occurs with a peptide substrate of the kinase; that a lipoyl source must be available for catalytic reduction by E3 or acetylation by E2; that the L2 lipoyl domain is much more effective in mediating kinase stimulation than the L1 domain; and that the kinase is remarkably sensitive to the level of acetylation of L2.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The ``Discussion'' integrates these observations and draws new mechanistic conclusions based on these and previous results.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Since removal of lipoyl groups has a disproportionately low effect on PDC activity at early stages, delipoylation is analyzed more accurately by determining changes in acetylation capacity (above).

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This mechanism for kinase stimulation predicts some TPP bound to E1 and a lipoyl domain source are required.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In their studies with purified porcine heart PDC, no stimulation by acetyl-CoA beyond that of NADH was detected, and they speculated that enhanced kinase activity might be due to the removal of an inhibition of kinase activity caused by the absence of an interaction between oxidized lipoate and the E1 substrate (8, 9) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Although not the correct mechanism and detection of an effect of acetyl-CoA required use of higher K concentration (see below), the suggestion of a role for changes in the intermediate status of lipoyl groups was insightful as was their linking of the stimulatory effect of pyruvate (41) to the effect of products(9) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	280	 This laboratory presented the initial and much subsequent evidence that reduction and acetylation of lipoyl prosthetic groups of PDC constituted essential steps in the operation of a sensitive signal translation process whereby increases in the NADH:NAD and acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios markedly enhance kinase activity(13, 14, 15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	281	 However, elucidation of the minimal requirements for the operation of this control could be accomplished only following a greatly enhanced understanding of the organization of the complex, the preparation of individual lipoyl domains of PDC-E2, and the availability of lipoamidase and lipoyl protein ligase, combined with the selective use of peptide substrate and free forms of lipoamide.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	282	Using these tools, we have found that the marked enhancement of kinase activity by acetyl-CoA requires a lipoate source and its reduction, the catalytic domain of E2, and a peptide substrate.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	283	 These requirements conclusively support a change in the kinase mediated by catalytically forming acetyl-dihydrolipoate.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Accumulation of this intermediate explains the similarly strong stimulation of kinase activity by low pyruvate via E1(TPP) catalysis.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The direct stimulation by dihydrolipoamide, its capacity to replace NADH in potentiating acetyl-CoA stimulation, and the complete lack of an effect of NADH on kinase activity in the absence of a lipoate source strongly favor NADH boosting kinase activity through its use in the E3 reaction.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We have established that this intervention is abolished by complete removal of lipoates from intact E2 subunits or lipoyl domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Of particular importance for understanding the operation and regulation of the kinase is our finding that the kinase-binding L2 domain is much more effective than E2's L1 domain or lipoamide in mediating kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The 3-fold increase in kinase activity generated by reductive acetylation of recombinant L2 is comparable to the change in kinase activity produced by acetylation of lipoyl moieties in the intact complex.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Thus, the L2 domain must have structural features that facilitate its dedicated roles in binding the kinase, producing enhanced E1 phosphorylation within the confines of the complex, and further increasing kinase activity upon reduction and acetylation of its lipoyl group.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This raises the question of the linkage between these L2-supported actions of the kinase.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	293	Detaching lipoates of the E2 core removes the capacity of the E2 core to give a severalfold increase in E1 phosphorylation(24) .

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It is significant that a lipoamidase treatment of PDC, which left only a few lipoates and caused close to full loss of this E2-enhanced kinase function, still allowed marked stimulation of the residual kinase activity upon acetylation of those few domains retaining lipoyl groups (PDC series in Fig.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	296	 This result forcefully suggests that the kinase has moved to the limited number of lipoylated L2 domains and, furthermore, that their acetylation (during a short-lived dissociation and reassociation of the kinase) facilitated kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Based on this continued stimulation when very few E2 subunits retain lipoate, we hypothesize that maximal effector stimulation is mediated by an allosteric effect induced by a reductively acetylated L2 domain that becomes engaged in binding of the kinase (i.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In the absence of a lipoyl domain source, kinase phosphorylation of E1 is not stimulated at low pyruvate ((17) , miniprint section); and here we show that TPP and a lipoyl domain source are needed to achieve pyruvate stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	302	 These findings raise the question as to whether the E1 reaction or the downstream (E2,E3) reactions determine the relative proportion of lipoates in the oxidized, reduced and acetylated forms in the complex.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Since E1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step(35, 36) , under most metabolic conditions, this distribution should be determined by the NADH:NAD and the acetyl-CoA:CoA ratios and kinase activity should primarily respond to their fluctuation.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	312	 While these probably contribute to a fine tuning role on a small portion of active PDC, enhanced phosphorylation should effectively throttle down PDC activity before onset of these extremes.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	313	A priori, the lesser enhancement of kinase activity by just the conversion of lipoates from the oxidized to the reduced form could involve either removal of an inhibitory interaction of oxidized lipoates, an enhancement of kinase activity by gain of a positive allosteric interaction of the reduced form, or a change in the thiol disulfide state of a kinase subunit.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Studies with E2-bound kinase found that the kinase is sensitive to thiol reagents(13, 52) , effects probably due to changes in the oxidation-reduction state of the lipoate of L2 domains.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Although there is a small increase in alkylation of cysteines of the K1 subunit following treatment of E2Xkinase-E3 with NADH, this was not rapidly reversed by excess NAD which opposes kinase stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	316	 ()Thus, a mediator role for changes in the thiol-disulfide status of the kinase is not indicated.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Our model proposes that a change from the kinase binding to one or two L2 containing only oxidized lipoate (nonstimulated K state) to interacting with an L2 containing a reduced or an acetylated lipoate results in the modified lipoates allosterically inducing conformational changes that generate the progressively more active K* or K** states, respectively.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	322	Consistent with stimulation occurring at low ratios of acetyl-CoA to CoA, half-maximal and near-maximal stimulation of kinase associated with the intact bovine kidney PDC are achieved with only 7-10 and 22-26 acetyl groups incorporated, respectively, per PDC(15, 16, 17) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	323	 With the recent knowledge that there are 3 lipoyl domains, two on E2 and one on the E3-binding protein giving a total of at least 126 lipoates per E2, ()it seems likely that no more than 12 and possibly as few as 7 acetyl groups are incorporated per PDC into the kinase-binding L2 domain for near-maximal stimulation, and as few as 3 and no more than 6 are incorporated for half-maximal stimulation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	324	 ()This constitutes a highly responsive regulatory mechanism in which the kinase must preferentially interact with acetylated L2 and suggests that full stimulation may result from only one subunit of a kinase dimer interacting with a reductively acetylated L2 domain.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Consistent with this prospect, half-maximal stimulation occurred with free L2 when only 20% of the L2 are acetylated.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Although a much higher portion was found than estimated (above) for the intact complex, very different conditions are operative at the outer surface of the complex where lipoyl domains are concentrated at 1 mM, making the localized L2 level at least 50-fold higher than the highest level of free L2 used in the present work.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Interaction of the kinase with acetylated-L2 would be aided by steady state turnover in the overall PDC reaction rapidly changing the location of acetyl groups within the multienzyme cluster.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Kinase shuffling between L2 domains may also contribute, but this is needed, regardless, since acetylation by acetyl-CoA requires an unhindered lipoate(50, 51) , and the kinase must interact after L2 acetylation.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	329	 We conclude that increased reductive-acetylation is very effective in activating kinase due to this preferred interaction of acetylated L2 altering the structure of the kinase and thereby increasing kinase activity (Fig.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Another property of the kinase that changes with increasing K ion is that ADP inhibition markedly increases(55) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	335	 A potential mechanism is that interaction of the kinase with an L2 domain containing an acetyl-dihydrolipoate leads to a conformational change in the kinase that speeds up ADP dissociation, which is probably the rate-limiting step in the kinase reaction at elevated (physiological) K levels.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Consistent with that prospect are the observation that acetylation causes a greater stimulation of ADP-inhibited kinase (13) and the evidence that kinase-ADP is a prominent reaction intermediate, since pyruvate effectively inhibits by binding to the kinase-ADP in the absence of free ADP(56) .
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	337	 For this mechanism to be correct, it must operate in conjunction with the slow rate of phosphorylation of peptide substrate, a particularly useful system for testing this mechanism.

0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	339	In conclusion, our results strongly support E3-catalyzed reduction and E2-catalyzed acetylation of lipoyl moiety of the kinase binding inner (L2) domain of E2 mediating a marked enhancement in kinase activity.
0.2066687.8557670.html.plaintext.txt	340	 The effectiveness in intact PDC of acetylating a low proportion of L2 domains in enhancing the phosphorylation of many bound E1 by a single tightly bound kinase molecule is probably accomplished by inter-L2 domain movement of the kinase combined with a stronger interaction of the kinase with acetylated L2 domains.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The molecular mechanism of cytoplasmic envelopment is unclear, but evidence suggests that the viral glycoprotein tails play an important role in the recruitment of tegument and capsids at the final envelopment site.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, due to redundancy in protein to protein interactions among the viral glycoproteins, genetic analysis of the role of individual glycoproteins in assembly has been difficult.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To overcome this problem, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein-binding assay was used in this study to test the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of one specific viral glycoprotein, gD, and tegument proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The study demonstrated that the 38 kDa tegument protein VP22 bound specifically to the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This association was dependent on arginine and lysine residues at positions 5 and 6 in the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition, HSV-1 capsids bound the gD tail and exhibited a similar sequence dependence.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It is concluded that VP22 may serve as a linker protein, mediating the interaction of the HSV capsid with gD.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The viral genome is packaged within an icosahedral capsid surrounded by an amorphous layer of proteins termed the tegument.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This in turn is contained within a lipid envelope bearing numerous virally encoded glycoproteins (Roizman  and  Pellett, 2001).
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	16	It is generally agreed that HSV capsids acquire their final tegument and envelope in the cytoplasm.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, the molecular mechanism of HSV-1 envelopment in the cytoplasm is poorly characterized.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	18	 During infection, viral membrane glycoproteins are expressed and traffic via cytoplasmic organelles to the cell surface.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Several lines of evidence suggest that the cytosolic domains of these glycoproteins may provide a platform for tegument assembly and recruitment of capsids followed by envelopment (Mettenleiter, 2002).
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In a recent study, a double mutant of pseudorabies virus (PrV) lacking viral glycoproteins gM and gE (or gM and the cytoplasmic tail of gE) showed a failure in envelopment, instead accumulating cytoplasmic nucleocapsids immersed in a dense layer of tegument (Brack et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Following single deletion of either glycoprotein, the production of infectious virions was not affected, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tails of gE and gM act in a redundant fashion during assembly, most likely interacting with the tegument proteins and, indirectly, with the surface of nucleocapsids.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In HSV-1, simultaneous deletion of the same two glycoproteins did not dramatically affect production of infectious virions (Browne et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 2004), although simultaneous deletion of gD and gE resulted in a striking defect in particle assembly (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This apparent redundancy makes analysis of specific glycoprotein to tegument interactions difficult to perform in vivo.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	25	 To overcome this obstacle, we developed a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein-binding assay to investigate the interaction between envelope glycoprotein tails and tegument partners in vitro.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This approach has previously been used to demonstrate the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein H (gH) and the tegument component VP16 (Gross et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the current study, we focused on analysing the tail of the glycoprotein D (gD) because it is a highly abundant component of the envelope (Spear  and  Roizman, 1972) with a short cytoplasmic tail of 30 amino acid residues that can easily be manipulated in mutagenesis studies.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, it has been shown to play a key, albeit redundant, role in assembly (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Additionally, Pomeranz  and  Blaho (1999) reported that gD co-localizes with at least one tegument protein, VP22, during infection.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	30	We prepared GST fusion proteins that contained the cytoplasmic tail of gD or mutants thereof at their carboxy terminus.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Following binding of the GST fusion proteins to glutathione to Sepharose beads and incubation with HSV-infected cell extracts, these fusion proteins were tested for their ability to interact with tegument proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Here we report that the cytoplasmic tail of gD bound to the tegument protein VP22 in a manner that was independent of other viral polypeptides.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Additionally, our results indicated that VP22 may be one of the tegument components that mediate the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of gD and the HSV capsid.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In contrast, binding to GST was at a much lower level and increased linearly in relation to the quantity of extract added, consistent with the lack of a saturable binding site.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This indicated that capsids were binding specifically to the gD tail, most likely indirectly, via tegument proteins.

0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	230	     DISCUSSION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cytoplasmic tails of HSV-1 glycoproteins have been shown to interact with various tegument proteins (Brack et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	231	, 2003; Zhu  and  Courtney, 1994), which may facilitate capsid recruitment to the site of envelopment.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	232	 So far, dissecting the molecular mechanism of assembly using a genetic approach has been complicated by redundancy among the viral glycoproteins: deletion of a single glycoprotein does not generally lead to apparent defects in cytoplasmic envelopment; instead, multiple simultaneous deletions are necessary.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In this study we took a biochemical approach towards analysing protein to protein interactions that might be important during virus assembly.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	234	We generated a fusion protein between GST and the cytoplasmic tail of gD in order to test its interaction with HSV-1 tegument proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Our results showed that the gD tail specifically bound the tegument protein VP22 but did not interact with the abundant cellular protein -tubulin nor with the capsid scaffold proteins ICP35 and Pra.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the interaction between gD and VP22 could be detected in infected cells.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Additionally, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the gD tail identified two amino acid residues, arginine and lysine (from the amino-terminal end of the tail) at positions 5 and 6, respectively, that were critical for VP22 binding.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	238	Since VP22 and VP16 form a complex (Elliott et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	239	, 1995) and we observed VP16 binding to the gD tail, we were interested to test whether VP22 bound the gD tail directly or via VP16 or other viral proteins.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Therefore, we synthesized 35S-labelled VP22 using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription/translation system and tested its ability to bind the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	241	 We found that in vitro-translated VP22 did bind specifically to the gD tail, showing that this binding was independent of other viral polypeptides.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	242	Under our conditions we also observed capsid binding to the gD tail.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This binding was saturable, unlike the low level of binding seen with GST alone.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We speculated that capsid binding to the gD tail was mediated by tegument components present in the crude capsid preparation.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Our results showed that the gD mutant tail gDR5K6 that failed to bind VP22 also failed to bind capsids.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This suggested that VP22 was mediating capsid to tail interactions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	247	 However, it is also possible that other tegument proteins mediate binding of capsids to the gD tail, utilizing the same residues as VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Although VP16 is present on these capsids (Fig.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	249	 5a) and can bind to the gH tail (Gross et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	250	, 2003), it appeared unable to tether capsids to the gH tail (Fig.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Additionally, we observed that VP16 was capable of binding to the gD mutant tail gDR5K6, which does not bind capsids (data not shown).
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This also suggested that VP16 was not involved in capsid to tail interactions under these conditions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	253	The association between VP22 and gD may be one of many interactions between glycoprotein tails and tegument proteins that facilitate the budding of capsids into organelles and the incorporation of tegument/glycoproteins into nascent virions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In HSV-1, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of gD had relatively little effect on normal virus production (Feenstra et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	255	 However, simultaneous deletion of gD and gE showed elimination of cytoplasmic envelopment and accumulation of large numbers of unenveloped nucleocapsids within a dense layer of tegument in the cytoplasm (Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	256	, 2003), indicating that gD and gE may share overlapping roles in cytoplasmic envelopment.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Our data suggest that at least one of these roles may be in VP22 recruitment and predict that the cytoplasmic tail of gE may also bind VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Interestingly, Farnsworth et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	259	 (2003) reported that the cytoplasmic tail of gE, when fused to GST, was indeed able to bind VP22.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Thus, gD and gE may act in a redundant manner to incorporate VP22 into the newly forming virions.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Alternatively, it could be argued that VP22 serves to gather gD and gE to the sites of capsid to envelope interaction.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	262	Our findings regarding HSV-1 are somewhat similar to data reported for the alphaherpesvirus PrV.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	263	 gE and gM have been shown to interact with the UL49 protein, a homologue of HSV-1 VP22 (Fuchs et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	264	, 2002), and, following simultaneous deletion of these two glycoproteins, the UL49 product does not become incorporated into the PrV particle (Fuchs et al.
0.20839827.15659744.html.plaintext.txt	265	 However, in the absence of the UL49 protein, gE and gM are incorporated into virions, implying that they may interact redundantly with other tegument proteins for this purpose.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here, we used the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model to analyze the effects of capsid phosphorylation and hydrogen bond formation.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The potential key phosphorylation site at serine 245 within the core protein, the building block of DHBV capsids, was substituted by alanine (S245A), aspartic acid (S245D) and asparagine (S245N), respectively.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hepadnaviruses are a group of small enveloped DNA viruses with a narrow host range and a relative tropism for the liver.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Hepatitis B virus (HBV),1 the prototypic member of the hepadnavirus family, is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, ranging from acute and chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1, 2).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Other members of the family include the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) (3, 4).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Similar to other viruses the hepadnaviral genome is protected by a nucleocapsid, which is formed by icosahedrally arranged core proteins.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The C-terminal domain of the core protein is rich in basic residues and bears three conserved serine phosphorylation sites (5, 6).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	19	 While dispensable for capsid assembly, this region is required for packaging of pregenomic RNA (7 to 11).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Inside the capsid the viral polymerase converts pregenomic RNA into minus-strand DNA, which in turn is completed to a double-stranded, relaxed circular (rc) DNA molecule (12).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Newly assembled, mature hepadnaviral capsids containing rcDNA have two possible fates: they can either be enveloped by surface proteins and enter the secretory pathway or be redirected to the nucleus where repair of the rcDNA molecule results in the formation of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, the template for viral RNA synthesis.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Nuclear translocation of viral rcDNA is also mediated by incoming capsids in newly infected cells.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, the precise mechanisms regulating capsid trafficking and uncoating in both settings are unknown.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	24	Earlier studies in the DHBV model have shown that capsids from infected livers are highly phosphorylated while serum-derived capsids and particles secreted from cultured cells are dephosphorylated (13, 14).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Furthermore, binding of in vitro generated HBV capsids to the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized hepatoma cells was previously found to depend on the phosphorylation status of the core protein (15).

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Position 245 within the C terminus of DHBV core was selected for detailed analysis since this site serves as a phosphate acceptor in transfected cells (5) and an earlier study had revealed an apparent effect of phosphoserine 245 on plus-strand DNA elongation (16).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, we have previously shown that the phenotype of two C-terminal deletion mutants is compatible with a potential key role of this position in capsid stability (17).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition to the effect of ionic charge at this position we also analyzed the potential effect of hydrogen bond formation.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Our data suggest that hydrogen bonding is required for the stabilization of newly assembled mature capsids while a negative ionic charge at position 245 of the DHBV core protein plays an essential role in nuclear capsid transport and infectivity.

0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	259	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Taken together our results indicate that serine at position 245 of the DHBV core protein plays a key role in regulating the structural integrity and intracellular trafficking of mature, rcDNA containing nucleocapsids during different stages of the viral life cycle, most likely via its phosphorylation status.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	260	Wild-type and S245N capsids were nuclease-resistant while encapsidated mature viral DNA generated by mutants S245D and S245A was nuclease-sensitive.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Possible reasons accounting for this observation include differences in local protein structure preferred by alanine and aspartic acid compared with serine and asparagine and/or electrostatic repulsion of DNA by aspartic acid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Furthermore, hydrogen bonding mediated by non-phosphorylated serine as well as asparagine may contribute to the stabilization of the quarterny structure of mature DHBV capsids.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The precise structural properties of mutant capsids that are associated with the nuclease-sensitivity of mature viral DNA remain to be further elucidated.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	264	 We obtained no evidence for a complete disintegration of mature S245A capsids in immunoprecipitation experiments and the density gradient sedimentation assay.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It should be noted, however that, partially dissociated S245A capsids may have reassembled after DNA release with rcDNA remaining attached to the outside of the capsid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Alternatively, the sensitivity of rcDNA may simply be based on an increased "breathing" of the capsid.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This phenomenon involves the slow release of capsid subunits followed by a rapid reformation of the capsid integrity, as discussed previously for HBV capsids (25).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	268	The fact that only mature rcDNA but not ssDNA associated with mutant capsids S245D and S245A was accessible to nuclease action indicates that DNA maturation itself is an important trigger of capsid destabilization.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Possibly, interactions of viral DNA with the C terminus of the core protein are of importance in this context (26).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Our results shed new light on previous data, which had implicated that the C-terminal domain of DHBV core protein is required for DNA maturation.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Rather, this report and our previous study on deletion and insertion mutants of the DHBV core protein (17) suggest that the phenotype of several mutants is at least in part due to nuclease sensitivity of mature viral DNA.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The fact that nuclease treatment is commonly used to remove plasmid DNA prior to extraction of nucleocapsid associated hepadnaviral DNA explains why fully mature DNA forms have not been observed earlier.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Indeed, we found that nuclease sensitivity of rcDNA also accounts for the phenotype of a previously described P246G mutant of DHBV core (16).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	274	2 It will be interesting to determine the relevance of these observations for HBV core protein mutants.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	275	Our data suggest that negative charges at position 245 as contributed by phosphorylated serine or aspartic acid support nuclear targeting of DHBV core protein, cccDNA formation and infectivity.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The residual cccDNA formation by mutant S245N could be due to nuclear import of small amounts of core protein mediated by the remaining, unchanged phosphorylation sites.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	277	 This may be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence since the polyclonal anti-DHBV core antibody may not react well with core protein dimers in fixed cells.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Alternatively, capsids might become entrapped non-specifically within the nucleus of dividing cells and be degraded subsequently.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Nevertheless, our infection experiments in PDH demonstrate that the residual cccDNA formation by S245N does not suffice to initiate productive infection.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	280	Collectively, our observations suggest the following model: maturation of rcDNA within the nucleocapsid is an important trigger of capsid destabilization, which ultimately results in DNA release.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	281	 During viral assembly hydrogen bonds formed by non-phosphorylated serine 245 contribute to the stabilization of nucleocapsids thus preventing DNA liberation in the cytoplasm.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	282	 During infection, phosphorylation of serine 245 directs the capsid to the nucleus.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	283	 At the same time nucleocapsids are destabilized thus facilitating rcDNA release in the nucleus.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	284	 These mechanisms would also apply to progeny capsids that are redirected to the nucleus for cccDNA amplification.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	285	 How newly formed DHBV capsids are directed to the secretory pathway remains to be elucidated, however, since Mabit and Schaller (13) have shown that dephosphorylation alone is not sufficient to confer membrane affinity.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The suggested model is in line with the previous observation in the duck model that serum-derived nucleocapsids are non-phosphorylated whereas nucleocapsids from liver tissue are highly phosphorylated (14).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	287	 It is tempting to speculate that incoming and recycling capsids are phosphorylated by a capsid-associated kinase activity of cellular origin, which has been described in the WHV and HBV system (27 to 33).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	288	The present report demonstrates a central role of serine 245 in regulating DHBV capsid trafficking and stability.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Clearly, however, the remaining phosphorylation sites within DHBV core may play an important role as well, since earlier reports indicate that serine 259 also affects viral infectivity (10, 16).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	290	 It remains to be elucidated which and how many residues of individual nucleocapsids are phosphorylated at a given time point and how core protein phosphorylation is orchestrated during capsid assembly and disassembly.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Further studies in the HBV and WHV system will have to establish whether mammalian core protein phosphorylation is essential for infectivity as well.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The recently described infection of primary tupaia hepatocytes (34) might represent a suitable model to address this question.
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Interestingly, phosphorylation of capsid protein by capsid-associated kinase activities has also been suggested to play a key role during the early steps of HIV infection (35).
0.19297737.12740387.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Thus, phosphorylation might represent a general mechanism regulating the targeted genome release from viral capsids.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, January 24, 2005 , and in revised form, February 22, 2005.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In the spherical virion of the parvovirus minute virus of mice, several amino acid side chains of the capsid were previously found to be involved in interactions with the viral single-stranded DNA molecule.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have individually truncated by mutation to alanine many (ten) of these side chains and analyzed the effects on capsid assembly, stability and conformation, viral DNA encapsidation, and virion infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Mutation of residues Tyr-270, Asp-273, or Asp-474 led to a drastic reduction in infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mutant Y270A was defective in capsid assembly; mutant D273A formed stable capsids, but it was essentially unable to encapsidate the viral DNA or to externalize the N terminus of the capsid protein VP2, a connected conformational event.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Mutation of residues Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, or Lys-471 led to a moderate reduction in infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	8	 None of these mutations had an effect on capsid assembly or stability, or on the DNA encapsidation process.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, those five mutant virions were substantially less stable than the parental virion in thermal inactivation assays.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The results with this model spherical virus indicate that several capsid residues that are found to be involved in polar interactions or multiple hydrophobic contacts with the viral DNA molecule contribute to preserving the active conformation of the infectious viral particle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Their effect appears to be mediated by the non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Many fundamental biological processes involve protein-nucleic acid recognition.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Double-stranded DNA-protein interactions have been extensively studied, but single-stranded (ss)1 DNA- or RNA-protein interactions are much less characterized.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In particular, very little is known about the molecular interactions between the nucleic acid genome of ssDNA or RNA virus and its protein shell, or the functional role of those interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Such knowledge may be essential for a better understanding of the life cycle of viruses, and for the design of drugs aimed at disrupting nucleic acid-protein interfaces.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	17	The structure of a helical virus, tobacco mosaic virus, has revealed defined interactions between repeating sets of three nucleotides in its ssRNA genome and each capsid subunit (reviewed in Ref.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the crystal structures of spherical viruses (reviewed in Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	19	 2 to 6) a large part, or all, of the nucleic acid component is invisible, because it is randomly oriented within the viral particles that form the crystal.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Fortunately, in a few icosahedral viruses some segments of the nucleic acid molecule (10 to 60% of the total) are arranged with the same symmetry as the capsid, and could be visualized.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The structural analysis (reviewed in Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	22	 4, 7 to 10) has revealed that the visible capsid-nucleic acid interfaces generally include a limited number of amino acids and some 7 to 30 nucleotides that in several, but not in all cases, form intramolecular double-helical segments.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The tertiary structure acquired by the nucleic acid within the virion may be at least partly independent of the nucleotide sequence (11).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Consistent with this observation, a capsid-binding nucleotide motif is not repeated exactly along the sequence, and thus the modeled nucleic acid stretch represents an average of the true individual sequences bound.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Accordingly, many of the interactions detected in viral nucleic acid-capsid interfaces are van der Waals and polar interactions with the nonspecific phosphate and pentose moieties, but more specific interactions with the bases are also observed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Ionic interactions between some phosphates and basic side chains protruding from the internal surface of the capsid, or located in disordered N-terminal (Nt) arms of capsid proteins, occur in several ssRNA plant viruses (12 to 17) and nodaviruses (18 to 20), and in the ssDNA bacteriophage X174 (21 to 23).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Such interactions were not observed in the ssRNA bean pod mottle virus (24) or in ssDNA parvoviruses (25 to 30), but many nucleic acid-capsid van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds were detected in the latter (25 to 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A high resolution structural model of the ssRNA satellite tobacco mosaic virus showed that binding of the RNA occurs mainly through an intricate network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (15).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Specific and nonspecific capsid protein-oligonucleotide interactions were also analyzed in detail in artificial complexes formed by a recombinant capsid of the bacteriophage MS2 and identical copies of a unique viral ssRNA fragment (OR) involved in translational repression and initiation of capsid assembly (31, 32).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This allowed a structural interpretation of mutational analyses on the formation of a biologically relevant complex between OR and an MS2 capsid protein dimer (32 to 37).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	31	Several studies have provided evidence for a functional role of the viral nucleic acid and its interactions with viral proteins in the assembly, conformation, stability, and/or disassembly of spherical virions (for some examples see Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, and partly due to the limited structural information available, mutational analyses to dissect the individual role(s) of specific capsid side chains that interact with the nucleic acid molecule are scarce (e.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Also, no single-residue scanning of capsid side chains involved in major interactions at the viral nucleic acid-capsid interface had, to our knowledge, been described.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	34	The parvoviruses canine parvovirus (CPV) and minute virus of mice (MVM) constitute good models for structure-function studies of residues involved in viral nucleic acid-capsid interactions, because of the structural simplicity of the virion and the relatively well defined viral DNA-capsid interfaces (25 to 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The icosahedral T = 1 capsid of MVM (29, 30) or CPV (25 to 28) is formed by 60 protein subunits that are contributed by three non-identical polypeptides, which are derived from a single gene and show identical fold and core sequence.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	36	 VP2 is the major capsid component, VP1 includes the VP2 sequence plus a Nt extension, and VP3 results from the cleavage of the Nt of some VP2 subunits (48, 49).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The DNA recognition site is essentially equivalent in CPV and MVM (strain i), and the major ordered ssDNA stretch (11 nucleotides) adopts a very similar conformation in both viruses (25, 26, 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This DNA segment interacts through multiple hydrophobic contacts and/or hydrogen bonds mainly with 7 to 9 side chains of the capsid of either CPV or MVM (25, 26, 30) (see Table I).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Most of these side chains are chemically and sterically identical or similar in both viruses (50) and participate in similar interactions with the DNA.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For MVMi, a few shorter DNA stretches, spatially close to the major ordered DNA segment, could also be modeled (29, 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We have individually truncated to alanine many of those residues of the MVM capsid that were previously (26, 30) found to be more involved in interactions with ordered nucleic acid in the structural model of the virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The individual effects of the mutations on virus infectivity, viral particle assembly, conformational stability, and DNA packaging have been analyzed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	43	View this table:    TABLE I DNA-protein interactions observed in the structural models of MVMi and CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	44	Contact analysis was carried out using the program Whatif (64) and the PDB files 1mvm [PDB] (29, 30) and 4dpv (26, 27), including symmetry-related subunits for completeness.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The MVM and CPV residues in each row occupy equivalent positions in the aligned sequence and in the three-dimensional structure.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Three DNA stretches of 11, 4 and 1 nucleotides (denoted here as A, B, and C, respectively) were included in the atomic coordinates of MVMi (29, 30), but only the equivalent to stretch A was included in both the unrefined (25) and the refined (26, 27) atomic coordinates of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Residues in parentheses are those not seen to participate in interactions with the visible DNA stretches in either MVM or CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Conservation of sequence and conformation is consistent with the possibility that the CPV residues in parentheses could interact with the equivalent to DNA stretches B and C, even though these regions could not be modeled in the crystal structure of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	49	     MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Recombinant Plasmids and Mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis of the VP1/VP2 gene of MVM (strain p) was carried out using the QuikChange system (Stratagene), on recombinant plasmid pSVtk-VP1/2, and the mutant sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The mutations were introduced by subcloning in the MVMp infectious clone pMM984, originally provided by P.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Tattersall (51), and modified to include the VP2 sequence of the MVMp variant used in our laboratories (52).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Two HindIII restriction sites, or unique sites XbaI and EcoRI in the VP2 gene were respectively used for mutations located upstream or downstream of the codon corresponding to amino acid residue 402.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The mutant infectious clones were subjected to restriction analysis, and the presence of the mutations and the entire sequence inserted were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The concentration of purified DNA was estimated first by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitated by ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	55	Electroporation of Mammalian Cells, Immunofluorescence, and Infectivity Assays For mutational analyses, mammalian NB324K cells at a concentration of 2 x 107 cells/ml were electroporated as described previously (53, 54) with equal, non-saturating amounts (10  microg) of the infectious recombinant plasmid carrying the appropriate mutations, using in each experiment the non-mutated infectious plasmid as a control.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Virions were recovered at 72 h from transfected monolayers and titrated in standard plaque-formation assays (55).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The results were normalized by quantitation, using SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and immunoblotting with anti-MVM antiserum, of the amount of viral capsid proteins present in extracts of the transfected cells (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	58	Immunofluorescence assays were as described previously (56), with minor modifications.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The primary antibodies used were: (i) a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the MVM capsid proteins (VPs) (52); (ii) a monoclonal antibody (B7) that recognizes a discontinuous epitope specific of the assembled capsid (57); and (iii) a polyclonal antibody elicited against the VP2 Nt that recognizes virions that have encapsidated the genome, and concomitantly externalized the VP2 Nt segment (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	60	Purification of Virions and Empty Capsids Natural infections with MVMp or transfection with its infectious recombinant plasmid yield a large proportion of empty capsids mixed with a minor proportion of infectious virions (49).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Partially purified mixtures of empty capsids and infectious virions were obtained essentially as described (56, 58) by centrifugation of the clarified cell extracts in sucrose gradients, followed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Empty capsids and infectious virions were purified by centrifugation in cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradients (see below), and dialyzed against PBS.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The capsid and virion preparations were found essentially free of contaminants by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was estimated by densitometry of stained gels and/or UV spectrophotometry (59).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	64	Conformational Stability of MVM Empty Capsids and Virions Followed by Spectrofluorometry A Varian Cary Eclipse luminescence spectrophotometer equipped with a computer-operated Peltier temperature control unit was used.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Empty capsids or purified virions were added to a 2- x 10-mm cell and irradiated with UV light (excitation wavelength, 295 nm).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The temperature was continuously increased from 25  degrees C to 85  degrees C (or 90  degrees C) at a constant rate of 1  degrees C/min, and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 330 nm was determined at 1-min intervals (59, 60).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	67	 During some experiments small aliquots were taken for the determination of the infectious virus titers (see below).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The changes in fluorescence were fitted to sigmoidal, cooperative transitions using the program KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software), which allowed a determination of the half-transition temperature (Tm) (59, 60).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	69	Thermal Inactivation of MVM Virions Followed by Infectivity Two procedures were used: (i) virion preparations were subjected to a thermal gradient as described above (see also 59, 60), and the infectious viruses remaining at different temperatures were determined by titration of aliquots taken from the heated sample.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	118	  Capsid assembly within the nucleus was detected with monoclonal antibody B7 that recognizes a capsid-specific, discontinuous epitope located on the virion external surface, at the vertex of the 3-fold spikes (57), and far away from the residues mutated (which are located at the internal capsid surface, and closer to the 2-fold axes).

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The non-mutated control, W60A, and D273A particles were produced at normal levels ( > 6400 HA units per 107 transfected cells), whereas Y270A yielded only 100 to 300 HA units per 107 transfected cells (not shown).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This confirmed that mutant Y270A is defective in capsid assembly.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	125	Externalization of the VP2 Nt and Packaging of the Viral DNA The maturation within the nucleus of MVM virions with an encapsidating genome triggers the externalization of the Nt of VP2 (48), an event that is required for infectivity, as the externalized peptide segment allows the traffic of the particle outward of the nucleus (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Thus, DNA-containing virions can be specifically detected in cells by in situ immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for epitopes located at the VP2 Nt (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	127	 All mutants except D273A and Y270A reacted strongly with this antibody (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	128	 2B and Table II), indicating that they were able to efficiently externalize the VP2 Nt and to encapsidate the viral genome.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	129	 As described above, Y270A yielded very low amounts of assembled capsids, and the reactivity with the anti-VP2 Nt antibody was proportionally reduced (Fig.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	132	It could be argued that mutation D273A may prevent the externalization of the VP2 Nt but not DNA encapsidation.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	133	 We considered this possibility unlikely, because the two events have been correlated (48, 56), and the mutations are located far away from the pores at the capsid 5-fold axes where the Nt are externalized.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, to analyze this issue further, mutants D273A, Y270A, W60A, and the non-mutated control were subjected to density gradient centrifugation analysis.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	135	 3, for the non-mutated control and mutant W60A a large amount of viral DNA was detected in the fractions with a density corresponding to virions, whereas viral DNA was detected at low levels in the equivalent Y270A fractions and was barely detectable in the D273A fractions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This result is entirely consistent with that of the immunofluorescence analysis (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	137	 2) and indicates that Y270A maintains a DNA-encapsidation capacity proportional to the low amounts of capsid assembled, whereas D273A does form normal amounts of empty capsids but has a severely impaired ability to encapsidate the viral genome.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	150	 However, the side chains of Tyr-270 and Trp-60 are each involved in multiple hydrophobic intrasubunit contacts and a hydrogen bond, and Lys-278 and Asp-474 interact with each other through an intersubunit salt bridge (Table II).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Truncation of some of these side chains could potentially affect the stability of the viral particles, not by disruption of DNA-capsid interactions, but because of the disruption of intracapsid interactions.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Superimposed with the linear decrease in fluorescence due to thermal quenching, two transitions were observed.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The first transition yielded a Tm = 42  plus or minus  3  degrees C (Fig.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Comparison with detailed analyses of the structurally very similar viral-like particles (VLPs) of MVMp (59) indicates that these two transitions correspond to a conformational rearrangement of the capsid associated with externalization of the VP2 Nt, and to capsid dissociation, respectively.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Partially purified non-mutated empty capsids (containing a very small fraction of virions, which did not significantly contribute to the variation in the fluorescence signal) were then assayed as described above for purified empty capsids.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The first transition occurred at a similar temperature, and the second transition, corresponding to dissociation of the capsid, yielded the same Tm, within error (Table II).

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Instead, the transition detected in the virion may be related to the externalization of the VP1 Nt, which has been shown to occur at a similar temperature (66).

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The titer at each temperature was obtained using several dilutions of the sample.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	193	 No infectious virions were detected at the three highest temperatures tested.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The experiment was repeated, and similar results were obtained.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	195	Even though the virion particle is disrupted only at high temperatures, its infectivity may be slightly reduced before capsid dissociation occurs (66, 67).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, during the thermal gradient experiments using purified non-mutated virions, aliquots were taken at different temperatures, and the remaining infectivity was determined in plaque assays.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The results suggest that infectivity may be lost in two steps (Fig.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The first step involved a moderate (5-fold) reduction in infectivity at about 50 to 55  degrees C, a temperature that was approximately coincident with that of the first transition observed by fluorescence (see above).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The second step involved a drastic reduction of infectivity (several orders of magnitude) that started at about 70  degrees C and led to a nearly complete loss of infectivity at about 80  degrees C, temperatures that corresponded approximately to those of dissociation of the virion, empty capsids, and VLPs (see above and Refs.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	200	The small virion:empty capsid ratio obtained from infections of cell lines with MVM (49), and the reduced infectivity of most mutants analyzed, made it difficult to obtain the relatively large amounts of each of the purified mutant virions that are needed for the above analysis.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	201	 However, the conformational stability of mutant infectious virions could be compared by following the reduction of infectivity in thermal inactivation kinetic assays, which required only a small amount of partially purified virions (61).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The results of these assays are shown in Fig.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The stability of mutants D273A, Y270A and, possibly, N491A was not substantially different to that of the non-mutated control.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	206	 To summarize, no mutation tested affected the thermal stability of the empty capsid, but most of them affected the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion.

0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	214	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Two aspects related to the experimental approach used in this work may require some discussion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	215	 First, the error in atomic positions in the MVM crystal structure (29, 30) in the absence of a complete refinement, and the necessary averaging of the true DNA sequences bound to symmetry-related sites in the capsid, introduce some uncertainty in the amino acid residues and interactions that participate in the DNA-capsid interface as defined in Table I.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, several evidences indicate that major DNA-capsid interactions (hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts), which involve the capsid residues analyzed in this study do occur in the MVM virion: (i) the conformations of the major visible DNA stretch in the MVMi and the CPV models are extremely similar (25, 26, 30); (ii) for many of the visible nucleotides the electron density is distinctive for purine or pyrimidine, and in some cases for individual base type (26, 30); (iii) a complete refinement of the CPV structure did not change in essence the major DNA-capsid interactions observed or the residues involved (25 to 27); (iv) the capsid residues involved in most interactions with ordered DNA are either conserved or conservatively substituted in both viruses (50); and (v) most of the interactions between these residues and the DNA are similar in both the MVMi and the refined CPV structural models (26, 30).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	217	Second, the use of empty capsids to analyze the contribution to virion stability of interactions between capsid amino acid residues assumes that these interactions are similar in both types of viral particles.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The structure of the CPV (68) or the MVM capsid (29, 58) is nearly identical in both the empty particle and in the DNA-full virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	219	 For CPV, a comparison of the refined structures of the virion and the empty capsid showed some local differences in the conformation of several residues in the DNA-binding region (68).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, a detailed contact analysis using the same structural models indicated that the residues equivalent to those of MVM we subjected to mutational analysis are involved in similar interactions in both the virion and the empty capsid: The side chains of Tyr-270 and Trp-60 in MVM, and the equivalent Phe-266 and Trp-58 in CPV, participate in multiple hydrophobic contacts with neighboring amino acid residues in the virion; in the empty capsid of CPV, nearly all of these contacts are preserved (further contacts were observed).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Lys-278 and Asp-474 in MVM and the equivalent Arg-274 and Asp-475 in CPV are linked in the virion by an intersubunit salt bridge, and this salt bridge is also preserved in the empty capsid of CPV.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	222	The results obtained, together with the considerations just discussed, allow us to propose defined structural roles for most of the residues that were found to be involved in major interactions with the viral DNA, which can explain the observed functional involvement of these residues in the virus life cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	223	Residues with Moderate Effects on Infectivity Truncation to Ala of Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, Lys-278, Lys-471, or Asn-491 did not significantly affect capsid protein expression, assembly into capsids inside the nucleus, or externalization of the VP2 Nt.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This latter fact indicates that those mutants are also able to encapsidate the DNA, as confirmed by direct encapsidation analysis using mutant W60A.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The side chains of Trp-60 and Lys-278, but not the others, not only may interact with the DNA, but are also involved in multiple interactions with other capsid residues as well.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, none of those seven mutations had any significant effect on the stability of the capsid itself.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In contrast, all of those mutations (with the possible exception of N491A, which had a lesser inhibitory effect on infectivity) caused a substantial reduction in the thermal sensitivity of the infectious virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	228	 These results indicate that the interactions of the mutated residues with the DNA, and not the interactions with other capsid residues, have a role in preserving the virion conformation needed for the infectivity of the virus particle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The aromatic ring of Trp-60 is oriented perpendicularly to the ring of a neighboring purine base, which allows extensive van der Waals contacts and favorable dipole interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Asp-58, and Asn-183 and Asn-491, may be hydrogen-bonded, respectively, to a purine base and to the sugar-phosphate backbone.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Thr-267 is involved in several van der Waals contacts.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Lys-278 and Lys-471 showed no contacts with the DNA, but they were relatively close to DNA phosphates, and could contribute to medium-range electrostatic interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	233	The results also showed that, even though no neutralization of the charge of most DNA phosphates has been detected, the thermal stability of the MVM virion is not reduced relative to that of the empty capsid at neutral pH.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	234	 We propose that the manyfold repeated hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the viral DNA and Asp-58, Trp-60, Asn-183, Thr-267, Lys-278, and Lys-471, and perhaps other residues involved in capsid protein-viral DNA interactions (Table I) that have not been analyzed in the present study, may help to counteract the potential destabilization caused by repulsion between non-neutralized DNA phosphates in the virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Truncation of the side chain of any of these residues except Lys-278 led to a reduction of infectivity by about one order of magnitude.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The individual contribution to virion stability and infectivity of each of those few residues involved in major interactions between the viral DNA and each capsid subunit is, thus, relatively moderate.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, their combined effect, if additive as expected, could be dramatically important.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	238	Mutation K278A also reduced virion stability, but not infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	239	 One possibility to explain this anomalous result (under study) is that the reduction in stability could be compensated by another, favorable effect of the same mutation on another step of the viral cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	240	Residues with Drastic Effects on Infectivity Truncation of Tyr-270, Asp-273, and Asp-474 did not affect capsid protein expression or nuclear transport.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	241	 However, contrary to the mutations discussed above, for these three mutants the reduction of infectivity was dramatic, and it does not appear to be caused by a reduction in the thermal stability of the infectious virion.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	242	Mutant Y270A is clearly defective in capsid assembly.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Tyr-270 is involved in multiple interactions not only with the DNA, but also with neighboring capsid residues.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, the most likely explanation for the inefficient assembly of this mutant, and the dramatic reduction in viral yield, is the removal of some critical intracapsid interactions.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	245	The D474A mutation did not prevent capsid assembly, and capsid stability was not reduced either.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The D474A virion did show a reduced stability, but similar or higher reductions in stability were observed for many mutants whose infectivity (viral yield) was reduced by only 10-fold.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Thus, the drastic reduction in infectivity of D474A may be related mainly to another, as yet unidentified step in the viral cycle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	248	Finally, the D273A mutation did not prevent capsid assembly, but it severely impaired the externalization of the Nt of VP2 and the encapsidation of the viral DNA, which explains its drastic effect on the infectivity.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Asp-273 is very close to a DNA phosphate, but not to any acidic or basic amino acid residue (the closest basic residue is Lys-494 at a distance of 4.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	250	7 A), and it makes no visible contacts with the DNA or with other amino acid residues.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	251	 One possibility is that the charge distribution at the capsid internal surface, which may be significantly altered if 60 negative charges are removed by the D273A mutation, may be critical for DNA packaging.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In addition, the D273A phenotype provides further support to the previous suggestion that encapsidation of the MVM genome occurs in empty capsids previously assembled inside the cell nucleus (56).
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	253	To conclude, the results found with this spherical virus model indicate that several amino acid residues per capsid subunit, which are involved in interactions with the viral nucleic acid molecule, are important for virus infectivity because of their role in preserving the integrity of the infectious virus particle.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Because most of these residues are not involved in substantial intracapsid interactions, and none of them contributes to the stability of the capsid itself, their effect may be directly mediated by the multiple non-covalent interactions they establish with the viral DNA.
0.15918402.15728575.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In addition, at least one acidic residue at each DNA-binding region is needed for DNA packaging.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	6	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   Human single gene disorders that affect the nervous system provide a host of natural mutations that can be deployed in the quest to understand its development and function.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A paradigm for this approach is the study of disorders caused by mutations in the gene for the neural cell recognition molecule L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	8	 L1 is the founder member of a subfamily of cell adhesion molecules that are primarily expressed in the nervous system, and to date it is the only one to be associated with a hereditary disease.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this review we will summarize how the analysis of pathological mutations in L1 is complementing the study of mouse models and in vitro analysis of L1 function.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	13	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   L1 is one member of a subfamily of four mammalian cell surface glycoproteins that are related by structure and sequence (Fig.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	14	 They belong to the large class of immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that can mediate cell to cell adhesion through Ca2+-independent homo- or heterophilic binding at the cell surface (1,2).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Each member of the L1 subfamily contains six Ig-like domains linked to five fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains on the extracellular surface, a single-pass transmembrane domain and a short, but highly conserved, cytoplasmic tail.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	16	 L1 or L1-like molecules with this structure have been identified in many species including rodent, fish, fruit fly and nematode.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In each case they have proven to be important components of the ligand to receptor network of guidance forces that influence axonal growth and guidance (for reviews see refs 3 to 5).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For this reason L1 is more aptly called a neural recognition molecule rather than adhesion molecule.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	19	View larger version (30K):    Figure 1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The vertebrate L1 subfamily comprises four structurally related molecules each containing six domains with structural similarity to the constant domains of immunoglobulins (Ig) and four or five domains similar to the type III repeats found in fibronectins (Fn).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	21	 NrCAM and Neurofascin (ankyrin binding glycoprotein/ABGP in rat) are known to have numerous isoforms dictated by alternative splicing, whereas L1 has only two isoforms: a neural isoform that includes the sequences encoded by mini exons 2 and 27 and a peripheral form that lacks these residues.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Neural L1 therefore contains five additional amino acids prior to the first Ig domain and a four-residue insertion in the cytoplasmic domain.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	23	 NgCAM is thought to be the chicken homologue of L1 although the sequence is not as highly conserved as that of other L1 subfamily members.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, functional studies using human or rodent L1 have usually corroborated findings conducted with the chick protein.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In this review NgCAM and L1 are considered functionally equivalent.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	26	  In mammals, L1 is expressed throughout the nervous system on subsets of developing and differentiated neurons as well as on Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	27	 On differentiated neurons L1 is found at regions of contact between neighbouring axons and on the growth cones, the structures at the leading tip of axons that are responsible for sensing extracellular growth and guidance cues.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This distribution supports the suggestion from in vitro studies that L1 adhesive inter actions may mediate axon bundling (fasciculation) (6,7) and that L1 acts as a growth cone receptor for signals that induce the extension of processes (neurites) from neurons in culture (8).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Neurite outgrowth is likened to axon growth and is taken as evidence that L1 may be involved in axon growth during development.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	30	 L1 is also involved in interactions between Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and axons (9,10), in neuronal cell migration (11), synaptogenesis, myelination, neuronal cell survival (12) and even long-term potentiation (13).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Although primarily expressed in the nervous system L1 is also found at other specialized sites including a subclass of leukocytes, intestinal crypt cells and kidney tubule epithelia (14 to 16, and reviewed in ref.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	32	 As the human disorder involving L1 is essentially neurological we will focus here on its role in the nervous system.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	36	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   Mutations in the L1 gene are responsible for an X-linked recessive neurological disorder that has been described as X-linked hydrocephalus, MASA syndrome or spastic paraplegia type I (SPG1).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The varying nomenclature is a reflection of extremely variable presentation both within and between families (reviewed in refs 18 to 20).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The most consistent features in affected boys are degrees of lower limb spasticity, mental retardation, hydrocephalus and flexion deformity of the thumbs.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Those that develop hydrocephalus (water on the brain) in utero or soon after birth have a lower life expectancy and many die neonatally.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The excess of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased size of cerebral ventricles may partly result from stenosis of a thin channel called the aqueduct of Sylvius through which CSF circulates, although inadequate cell migration or loss of neurons may also contribute to the increase in cavity size.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Perhaps the most striking pathological observation is hypoplasia or absence of two long axonal tracts, the cortico spinal tract (CST) and the corpus callosum.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The former is involved in the control of voluntary motor function and its disruption provides an explanation for the spasticity observed in the patients.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The corpus callosum is the large bundle of nerve fibres that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and its underdevelopment may contribute to the mental retardation or epilepsy observed in patients with abnormal L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Other frequent malformations include underdevelopment of the anterior vermis of the cerebellum and fused thalami (21) which may indicate abnormal neuronal proliferation, migration or survival.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	45	The L1 protein in mice is very similar in sequence to human L1 and its targeted disruption in  knockout  mice produces interesting phenotypic similarities.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	46	 As in the human condition, the central nervous system of these mice is largely intact with major malformation limited to hypoplasia of the CST, corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis and a degree of ventricular enlargement (22).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	47	 L1 disruption in mice also produces a cognitive defect that may relate to the  mental retardation  of the human condition (23).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	48	 However, the real value of the mouse models is that a more detailed analysis of nervous system malformations and the mechanism underlying them is possible.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	49	 For example, abnormalities of the hippocampus and the morphology of individual neurons have been noted in L1 knockout mice (24).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Furthermore, in vivo confirmation of the involvement of L1 in Schwann cell function follows from the observation that L1-deficient mice have reduced interaction between Schwann cells and the axons of unmyelinated sensory nerves.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The resulting degeneration of sensory axons leads to impaired sensory function (10).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This observation will un- doubtedly lead to an assessment of sensory function in human subjects with L1 mutations.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	53	The mechanism by which L1 mutation disrupts the development of the CST in knockout lines involves failure in axonal pathfinding at a time when these axons are required to grow across the midline (25).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Presumably, L1 is required as an attractive or repulsive cue, substrate or neuronal receptor at this point in axon guidance.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The underdeveloped CST observed in mouse and man could result from degeneration of neurons that do not synapse with the correct targets.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In keeping with the extreme interfamilial as well as intrafamilial variability seen for the condition in man, some aspects of the knockout phenotype in mouse vary markedly on different genetic backgrounds (24), indicating the epistatic influence of other genes on the  penetrance  of the L1 mutation.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	57	Overall, the phenotypes observed in mouse and man show that L1 function is clearly pivotal for generation of certain axonal tracts and important for correct cortical and cerebellar morphology.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	61	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   It is apparent that L1 participates in a variety of different cellular responses both within and outside the nervous system.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This flexibility of function is probably related to a multiplicity of binding partners, potential signalling routes and post-translational modifications.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	63	Cell surface ligands A bewildering array of molecules have been found to bind to the extracellular domains (ECDs) of L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	64	 These include L1 itself, other members of the Ig superfamily, integrins, extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin and a variety of proteoglycans (reviewed in refs 17,26,27) (Fig.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Where and when these different interactions are relevant is now the challenging question.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	66	 L1 acting as ligand and receptor, will promote both cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth from explanted neurons, indicating that this interaction may be relevant to both fasciculation and axon growth.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Furthermore, cerebellar neurons from L1 knockout mice will no longer extend processes on purified L1 (22).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	68	 However, heterophilic ligands for L1 may also influence L1 activity.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In several cases this influence is exerted in the plane of the neuronal membrane (in cis).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For example, L1 binds in cis to TAG-1 a member of another subfamily of Ig CAMs (28) and this interaction may even be required for L1 to L1 mediated neurite outgrowth from specific neurons (29,30).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	71	 DM-GRASP, another cell surface adhesion molecule, may also cooperate with L1 to promote neurite outgrowth (31).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Cis interaction with NCAM has been shown to enhance the ability of L1 to bind homophilically (32) and the small cell surface glyco protein nectadrin (CD24) may also be recruited to this complex (33).

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	76	 another cell membrane or extracellular matrix.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This interaction is known initiate neurite outgrowth through activation of a fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) and a local increase in intracellular calcium within the neuronal growth cone (at least in some in vitro systems).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	78	 L1 is likely to be part of a complex that involves cis and trans interactions at the cell surface.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Some of these may modulate L1 binding or activity.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The biological consequences of L1 interaction with its many potential heterophilic ligands are largely unknown, although interaction with neurocan may have a negative effect on adhesion or axon growth.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The cytoplasmic domain interacts with the cytoskeleton and is subject to phosphorylation by a variety of kinases.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Ankyrin is mobilized to sites of L1 to L1 binding through direct attachment to L1 and this has an  inside-out  effect of stabilizing homophilic interaction.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Thin arrows represent binding potential, thick arrows a biological effect.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	84	 F11 and F3, and axonin-1 and TAG-1, are homologous chick and mammalian proteins, respectively.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	85	  Not all of L1 s potential interactions result in a positive effect on adhesion or axon growth.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	86	 For example, L1 binds with strong affinity to neurocan, a neural, extracellular matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that has an inhibitory effect on both neuronal adhesion and neurite outgrowth (34).

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	89	 At least one mechanism through which L1 to L1 recognition can stimulate axonal growth is by activating the tyrosine kinase-linked receptors for fibroblast growth factors (FGFRs).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The downstream signalling cascade involved has been worked out in considerable detail and culminates in transient influx of calcium through L- and N-type channels at localized sites in the growth cone (35,36).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Growth cone morphology and behaviour are known to be sensitive to waves of calcium with increased concentration generally slowing neuritic growth (37,38).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	92	 How focal domains of calcium conversely promote growth cone advance is not understood, although one possibility is through the action of Ca2+-dependent modifiers of the actin cytoskeleton.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	93	Dimerization with TAG-1 offers yet another mechanism through which L1 may influence intracellular events as the chick homologue of TAG-1 (axonin-1) is associated, through an unknown linker, with non-receptor tyrosine kinase (39).

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	98	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   The 100 or so amino acid stretch of the cytoplasmic domain is the most conserved region between L1-like molecules in all species and its functional importance is highlighted by the finding that deletions or even single amino acid changes in this region can cause neurological disease in man.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Members of the L1 subfamily share an amino acid sequence that has high affinity for ankyrin, a linker protein of the spectrin-based cytoskeleton that underlies the plasma membrane (43,44).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Ankyrins are multi-domain proteins that can bind both cytoskeletal and integral membrane components and two forms (ankyrinB and ankyrinG) are abundant in the nervous system (45).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Mobilization of ankyrin to sites of cell contact is observed on homophilic binding of L1 or on formation of a TAG-1 to L1 complex (28).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Thus CAM adhesion is translated into mobilization of cytoskeletal components and potentially of other integral membrane proteins.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The ability of L1-like molecules to bind ankyrin is regulated by phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue within the L1 cytoplasmic motif FIGQY (46).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Interestingly, deletion, mutation or phosphorylation of this motif has an inside-out effect on the ability of L1-like CAMs to bind homophilically (46), suggesting that ankyrin recruitment may have a role in stabilization of intercellular contacts that involve L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A role for ankyrin in L1 function is supported by the remarkable overlap between the phenotype of ankyrinB to / to  mice, L1-deficient mice and human subjects with L1 mutations (47).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The cytoplasmic domain can also associate with actin stress fibres (48).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	107	The cytoplasmic domain also houses a tyrosine-based sorting motif, YRSL (or more generally Yxx, where is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain), that is required for the correct trafficking of L1 along axons to the growth cone as well as for L1 endocytosis (49,50, and see below).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The YRSL motif binds to the adaptor complex AP-2 in a pathway of internalization via clathrin-coated pits.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	109	L1 modification L1 is subject to glycosylation and phosphorylation, both of which may affect its function.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Modulation of L1 function by NCAM, for example, occurs through recognition of L1 carbohydrate (32).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of the ankyrin-binding domain, serine phosphorylation by specific kinases occurs at several sites (40,51 to 53).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Interestingly, these sites are next to known binding domains for either cytoskeletal components or the AP-2 complex (Fig.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	113	 3A), suggesting that serine phosphorylation may influence cytoplasmic inter actions, L1 mobility and internalization.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Indeed, phosphorylation by ERK2 is found to be dependent on L1 endocytosis in vitro (40).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	115	 ERK2 and p90rsk are components of the MAPK pathway, a signalling cascade that can also be activated by FGFRs.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The YRSL motif of L1 is required for correct targeting to the growth cone.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	122	 It interacts with the AP-2 adapter complex facilitating endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This may control the ability of L1 to respond rapidly to changes in environment.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This motif is partly encoded by an alternatively-spliced exon 27 (RSLE).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The rapid formation and disassociation of stable adhesion complexes of L1 with itself and other heterophilic ligands probably requires specific interaction with two components of the cytoskeleton: actin and ankyrin.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This may be regulated by phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Studies on NgCAM, the chicken homologue of L1, highlight Ig domains 2 to 4 as having a key role in homophilic binding (7).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Interactions of mutant L1 with F11 and axonin-1 indicate that the integrity of a number of domains are required (69) although the effects of individual mutations are distinct from their effects on L1 to L1 interaction.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Domain-deletion studies using NgCAM and axonin-1 suggest the involvement of at least Ig domains 2 to 4 and Fn domain 3 (7).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	138	 A site for integrin binding of 5ss1 or vss3 has been localized to two RGD motifs in the sixth Ig domain (71,72).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Neurocan, which inhibits neurite outgrowth, can bind Ig domain 1 but other domains may also be involved (72).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	140	  It has been known for some time that in addition to full-length 200 kDa protein, fragments of L1 polypeptide can be found in tissue extracts, but it has been a matter of debate whether L1 is specifically cleaved.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Recently, however, a matrix metalloprotease (TACE) and plasmin have been shown to release L1 from the cell surface through cleavage at specific sites (54,55) (Fig.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This raises the interesting possibility that as well as acting as a cell surface receptor, L1 may be released in a soluble form that could act as a ligand at some distance from its source.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Along with regulated endocytosis this may modulate the spatial availability of L1 in response to intra- or extracellular signals.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Such regulation may be very important, for example, at the growth cone where polarity of L1-mediated effects may influence axonal turning.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	145	L1 expression Further modification of L1 activity and localization is afforded by the use of specific splice variants.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The L1 gene comprises 29 exons of which 28 are coding (56,57).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Studies on its transcriptional regulation have revealed that its neural expression is at least partly determined by a neuron restrictive silencing element (NRSE) contained within the second intron and a homeobox- and paired domain-containing region (HPD) in the first intron (57,58).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Neural expression is also associated with inclusion of two mini exons (exons 2 and 27) that are excluded from the non-neural transcript (59,60).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Exon 27 (encoding RSLE) has a neuron-specific function as it contributes to the YRSL motif that is required for targeting to the growth cone.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	150	 As this sequence is lacking outside the nervous system AP-2-mediated endocytosis of L1 is presumably also restricted to neural tissue.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Most forms of mutation have been reported and they are distributed across all domains (38 missense, 10 nonsense, 21 frameshift, 17 splicing, 5 intragenic deletion and 1 intragenic duplication).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Most of the nonsense and frameshift mutations would eliminate cell surface expression of L1 through truncation prior to the transmembrane domain.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Although the mutations are heterogeneous, attempts to relate position and type of disruption to phenotype are confounded by intrafamilial variability in presentation.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Nevertheless, mutations of the cytoplasmic domain are less likely to cause life-threatening hydrocephalus than those disrupting the extra cellular surface, indicating some qualitative difference in the effect of these two broad classes of mutation (63).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	160	 As homophilic binding may be preserved in the absence of the cytoplasmic domain (64,65) the relative longevity of patients with cytoplasmic mutations may be due to preservation of some of L1 s  adhesive  functions.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Whereas some delete additional functional sites, all eliminate at least part of the conserved ankyrin-binding domain as well as the tyrosine residue at position 1229 that is involved in moderating ankyrin binding for the L1 subfamily (46,66).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Mutation of Y1229 to histidine in one family confirms the importance of controlled ankyrin binding for L1 function in the nervous system.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	173	 SUMMARY REFERENCES   The most interesting mutations to consider with respect to gene function are the missense mutations and for L1 these represent the largest single class.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The majority are distributed across 10 of 11 of the ECDs (Fig.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Outline structures for the ECDs based on the crystallographic resolution of related proteins allow predictions to be made concerning the structural outcome of many of these changes (67).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Over half of the mutations that can be mapped onto these structures are found to affect residues that are key to the structural integrity of individual domains (Table 1).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	177	 A smaller proportion affect residues that are not part of the core structure and are more likely to affect surface properties of L1 than domain integrity.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Additional insight comes from the structural resolution of hemolin, an insect protein composed of four Ig domains with similarity to the first four domains of L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In hemolin these domains are folded into a horseshoe structure through interaction between Ig domains 1 and 4 and between domains 2 and 3 (68).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Interestingly, 50% of the human mutations affected Ig domains 1 to 4 lie in the contact regions that are required for this four-domain conglomerate.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Missense mutations in L1 and their effect on domain structure and ligand binding   Missense mutations can theoretically have a number of consequences for L1 production and function.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Firstly, they may alter the folding or intracellular trafficking of L1.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	183	 A mutation of the signal peptide (W9S), for example, has predictably been found to affect cell surface expression (69).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Secondly, mutations that put a cysteine on the surface of the molecule, such as Y194C and Y1070C, could be affecting protein function or mobility by promoting inappropriate intermolecular disulfides either during folding or on the cell surface.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thirdly, and most intriguingly, some of these mutations may affect ligand binding and therefore offer the potential for mutation-based structure to function studies.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Through analysing 12 mutations we have shown that missense changes in the ECDs have variable effects on binding of L1 to itself or to the related CAMs TAG-1/axonin-1 and F3/F11 (69) (Table 1).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Whereas many mutations affect more than one binding activity, several have no influence or affect homo- or heterophilic binding selectively.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	188	 As the latter are usually surface changes they may highlight key binding sites for specific ligands.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	189	 For example, E309K is a surface mutation that does not affect homophilic binding but severely compromises binding to axonin-1 and F11.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Interestingly, mutations affect TAG-1/axonin-1 and F3/F11 binding in a similar way indicating that these two structurally related ligands interact with L1 in a very similar fashion.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These studies indicate, for the first time, that pathogenesis may result from different effects on L1 ligand binding.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	192	 That several domains are required for correct homo- or heterophilic binding of L1 is also apparent.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This is in contrast to results of a previous study using isolated domains, which suggested that only Ig domain 2 was required for homophilic interaction (70).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This difference may be reconciled if Ig domain 2 contains an essential binding site but interaction requires considerable antiparallel overlap of L1 monomers.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Figure 3B also shows the distribution of missense mutations alongside known binding regions for several L1 ligands (7,69 to 72).
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	196	 It is clear that domains of interaction overlap considerably and that human mutations may also be affecting binding to integrins or proteo glycans.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Further studies on the effects of L1 mutations both on ligand binding and on intracellular processing will allow a much better understanding of disease pathology and the functional requirements of L1 domains, and will influence the design of animal models that test the relevance of disrupting specific aspects of L1 interaction and mobility.

0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Secondly, it has an intimate and plastic relationship with the cytoskeleton.
0.16214354.10767310.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thirdly, L1 activity is mediated by a number of different binding partners, both in trans and in cis, as well as post-translational modification and cleavage.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	6	We examined gene and surface expression and activity of the endothelin (ET)-1 receptors (ETA and ETB) in subendothelial (L1) and inner medial (L2) cells from the main pulmonary artery of sheep with continuous air embolization (CAE)-induced chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	7	 According to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, basal gene expression of both receptors was significantly higher in L2 than L1 cells, and hypertensive L2 cells showed significantly higher gene expression of ETB than controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Expression of both genes in hypertensive L1 cells was similar to controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis confirmed the increased distribution of ETB in hypertensive L2 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Although only the ETA receptors in control L2 cells showed significant binding of [125I]-labeled ET-1 at 1 h, both receptors bound ET-1 to hypertensive cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Exposure to exogenous ET-1 for 18 h revealed that only the L2 cells internalized ET-1, and internalization by hypertensive L2 cells was significantly reduced when compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Treatment with ETA (BQ-610) and ETB (BQ-788) receptor antagonists demonstrated that both receptors contributed to internalization of ET-1 in control L2 cells, whereas in hypertensive cells only when both receptor antagonists were used in combination was significant suppression of ET-1 internalization found.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We conclude that in sheep receiving CAE, alterations in ETB receptors in cells of the L2 layer may contribute to the maintenance of CPH via alterations in their expression, distribution, and activity.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	16	SINCE ITS DISCOVERY 12 YEARS AGO, endothelin (ET) has been shown to contribute to a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in various systems (22).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The ET family of 21 amino acid peptides exists in three distinct isoforms: ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is an extremely potent vasoconstrictor resulting in slowly developing and sustained contraction.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Although the endothelial cell was originally described as the source of ET-1, it is now known that several other cell types, including pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, synthesize this peptide (33, 36).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	20	The biological effects of ET-1 are mediated by two distinct ET receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB (1, 35).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The affinity of the ETA receptor for ET-1 has been shown to be ~100 times that for ET-3 (ET-1  >  ET-2  >  ET-3), whereas the affinity of the ETB receptor is equipotent for all three isoforms of ET (34).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Early reports indicated that the ETA receptor on smooth muscle was responsible for the vasoconstrictor effect of ET-1, whereas the ETB receptor on endothelial cells modulated ET-1-induced vasodilation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, recent pharmacological studies suggest that there are two classes of ETB with cell specific effects, ETB1 on endothelial cells mediating vasodilation and ETB2 on smooth muscle cells mediating vasoconstriction (9).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The ETB receptor also functions as a "clearance receptor" and is particularly important in the lung, where 50% of ET-1 is retained (22, 29).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	25	ET-1 has been linked to the development of chronic pulmonary hypertension (CPH).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Increased expression of the peptide has been demonstrated in endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries from patients with idiopathic and secondary forms of pulmonary hypertension (15), and arterial-to-venous ratios of ET-1 protein were found to be elevated above the normal range in patients with pulmonary hypertension (40).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Several studies have linked increased expression of ET-1 to the development of hypoxia-induced CPH in rats (5, 24), and use of ET-1 receptor antagonists has been shown both to inhibit progression of the disease and to promote recovery (4, 10, 43).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	28	Although these studies support a central role for ET-1 in the pathogenesis of CPH, the picture is likely more complicated than first suspected, in that prepro-ET-1 (ppET-1) mRNA is decreased in the monocrotaline model of CPH, and in addition, we recently reported regional variability in ppET-1 gene expression in the pulmonary artery of normal sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, we found in a model of CPH, sheep receiving continuous air embolization (CAE) into the main pulmonary artery, that ppET-1 gene expression in the main pulmonary artery and peripheral lung gradually decreased with the onset of pulmonary hypertension while the midregion artery (9th-10th generation) showed a gradual increase (42).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	30	At least four cell types have been identified in the bovine main pulmonary artery: subendothelial L1 cells, inner medial L2 cells, and outer medial L3S and L3R cells (12, 13).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We recently showed that L1 cells (a cell with characteristics of both endothelial and smooth muscle cells) cultured from control sheep produce strikingly more ET-1 than L2 cells (mature smooth muscle cells) under basal conditions, but when exposed to exogenous ET-1, only the L2 cells internalize exogenous ET-1 (41).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The present study examines whether ETA and ETB gene and surface expression is altered in L1 and L2 cells from control and hypertensive sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This study also examines whether ET-1 receptor distribution and activity are altered in L1 and L2 cells cultured from hypertensive sheep induced by 12 days of CAE.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The protocol for delivery of CAE into the sheep pulmonary artery has been described previously, and the physiological and structural changes for this model of CPH have been reported in detail (16, 32).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Briefly, a left thoracotomy was performed on yearling mixed-breed sheep under general anesthesia, and pulmonary artery and left atrial catheters were inserted.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A jugular venous introducer and carotid artery catheter were placed through a neck incision.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	38	 After a recovery period of 3-5 days, a Swan-Ganz catheter was positioned in the pulmonary artery through the jugular vein introducer.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Baseline measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), cardiac output (CO), and left atrial pressure (Pla) were made, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated using the formula: PVR = (Ppa  Pla)/CO.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	40	 After baseline measurements, the sheep received CAE (n = 3) into the pulmonary artery by way of the proximal port (lying in the right heart) of the Swan-Ganz catheter over a 12-day period.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The rate of air embolization administered was sufficient to cause an increase in PVR that was ~2.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Physiological measurements were performed each day, and the rate of air flow was adjusted as necessary to maintain the elevation in PVR.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Surgically prepared animals not receiving air but maintained for the same time period served as controls (n = 3).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	44	 At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed with an overdose of sodium barbiturate (pentobarbital sodium 325 mg   ml1   5 kg1 body wt, Euthanazia-5 solution; Henry Schein, Port Washington, NY), and the lungs were removed.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The main pulmonary artery was dissected from a point 1 cm from its exit from the right ventricle to its point of entry into the right and left lungs, and a section was taken for routine light microscopy and for 1- microm sections of epoxy-embedded tissue.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Cells were isolated from the subendothelial (L1) and inner medial (L2) layers of the main pulmonary artery from control and hypertensive sheep as previously described (41, 42).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Briefly, the artery was opened, and the endothelial layer was removed by gentle scraping; the subendothelial L1 cells were isolated from pulmonary artery segments by deep scraping.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The inner media L2 cells were isolated either by a modified explant technique or by enzymatic dissociation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Using phase contrast microscopy, we identified L1 and L2 cell colonies by their morphology, trypsinized them in "cloning rings" and transferred them into culture dishes.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Both cells types were seeded and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100  microg/ml streptomycin, 40  microg/ml gentamicin, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY), and 15% heat-inactivated calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Confluent cells (passages 3-6) were used for all experiments; higher passage numbers have been associated with a substantial increase in ETB receptor density (27).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Cell lines cultured from each of three different control and three different hypertensive animals were used for each assay.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	53	 All experiments were carried out in RPMI-1640 containing 0.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Experiments were initiated after overnight incubation of the cells in that medium.

0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	243	    DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	244	In a previous study, our group identified differences in the ET-1 system in L1 and L2 cells from control sheep (41).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	245	 L1 cells, like endothelial cells, were found to synthesize and release ET-1, whereas L2 cells had less synthetic capacity for ET-1 but, rather, had the propensity to internalize exogenous ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The present study extends these findings and examines ETA and ETB gene and surface expression, Bmax sites, and activity as assessed by ET-1 internalization by L1 and L2 cells from the main pulmonary artery of control sheep and those with sustained pulmonary hypertension induced by CAE.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The present in vitro study documents that the hypertensive L2 cells, as seen in vivo, maintain their hypertrophic appearance, whereas the L1 cells from the thickened subendothelial layer revert to an appearance similar to controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In addition, we show that L2 cells from control and hypertensive animals exhibit significantly higher basal expression of both the ETA and ETB genes than L1 cells and that ETB gene and surface expression in hypertensive L2 cells was significantly increased compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The present findings also confirm that L2, but not L1, cells from control sheep internalize exogenous ET-1 in a dose-dependent manner and further demonstrate that L2 cells from hypertensive sheep internalize less ET-1 than controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In addition, we found that in control cells, the ETA receptors were mainly responsible for binding ET-1 to the L2 cells, but after 18 h of exposure to ET-1, both receptors played a role in internalization.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Using ETA and ETB receptor antagonists, our study also demonstrates that in hypertensive cells, both receptors bound radiolabeled ET-1; internalization of ET-1, however, was inhibited only when the ETA and ETB antagonists were used in combination.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	252	Function of ETA and ETB receptors.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In humans, ETA and ETB are encoded by distinct genes located on chromosomes 4 and 13, respectively (32).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, the ETA receptor is linked to vasoconstriction as well as hypertrophy and smooth muscle proliferation, whereas the ETB receptor is linked to clearance of ET-1 from the circulation as well as both vasoconstriction and vasodilation (22, 36, 39).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Studies in the pulmonary vasculature suggest that the actions of ET-1 are mediated by at least three receptors: one ETA receptor and two ETB receptor subtypes.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Pharmacological studies in several species indicate that the endothelial ETB receptor (designated ETB1) mediates vasodilatation, whereas the ETB2 receptor expressed in smooth muscle acts as vasoconstrictor (5, 7, 9).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	257	ETA and ETB receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that undergo agonist-stimulated desensitization or inactivation (26).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Desensitization is thought to prevent both overstimulation and damage to activated cells as well as saturation by weak stimuli.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Phosphorylation has been identified as the major mechanism for rapid desensitization for many G protein-coupled receptors.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In humans, ETA receptors have been shown to have a prolonged period of desensitization occurring within 5 min of exposure to ET-1; sensitization is restored between 80 and 120 min (8).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This prolonged desensitization period seems to be unique to the ETA receptor and may explain, at least in part, the prolonged contraction of smooth muscle cells in response to ET-1 (6).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	262	 The ETB receptors, on the other hand, are rapidly deactivated (via phosphorylation and dehydration) and lose  > 80% of their initial activity within 5 min of agonist stimulation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This rapid deactivation of ETB has been linked to the short-term vasodilatory effect of ET-1 (7).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The present study shows that both ETA and ETB receptors bind and are responsible for internalization of exogenous ET-1; however, our data in hypertensive cells suggest that both receptors types have become desensitized.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	265	ETA and ETB receptors in L1 and L2 cells from control sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Both ETA and ETB receptors have been identified in pulmonary and systemic vascular smooth muscle cells, e.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	267	, rat aorta (30), human internal mammary artery and vein, porcine coronary arteries (37), and rat and human pulmonary artery (28).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In humans, ETA receptors were found in both resistance and conduit arteries, and in the main pulmonary artery, ETA receptors predominated (90%) (5).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Tracheal smooth muscle from rats and mice, however, exhibited approximately equal numbers of the two receptor subtypes (18), whereas ETB receptors were 50% more numerous than ETA in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (23).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Thus the distribution and density of ET-1 receptors on various smooth muscle types may vary between species and location (5, 31).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	271	The present study demonstrates that L1 and L2 cells from control sheep express both the ETA and ETB genes.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The significantly lower expression of both genes in L1 cells compared with L2 cells substantiates our previous suggestion that the L1 cell contributes little to the maintenance of vascular tone in the main pulmonary artery.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The paucity of ET-1 receptors in L1 cells also corroborates our finding that these cells fail to internalize exogenous ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	274	Our binding studies confirm the notion that activity of the ETA receptors predominates in L2 cells from the main pulmonary artery of control sheep.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	275	 With long-term exposure, however, it seems that both receptors participate equally in the internalization process.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	276	 This difference is likely to reflect the effects of long- and short-term exposure, the ETB receptor becoming more active when exposure to ET-1 is prolonged perhaps as a result of an increase in the requirement for internalization, and degradation of ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Previous studies in isolated, perfused rat lungs (29) have also shown that both receptors play a role in clearance of ET-1 (14).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	278	ETA and ETB receptors in hypertensive L2 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Alterations in ET-1 receptors have been demonstrated in several models of CPH.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	280	 For example, increased ETA gene expression was demonstrated in rat lungs and increased ETB gene expression in the rat main pulmonary artery after exposure to hypoxia for 48 h (25).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	281	 After 14 days of hypoxia, increased expression of both ETA and ETB was found in the distal pulmonary arteries of rats, ETA expression occurring mainly in the media and ETB in the intima; no change in expression of either receptor was found in the large muscular pulmonary arteries (39).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In contrast to the hypoxic models, in monocrotaline-induced CPH, ETB receptor mRNA was shown to be decreased in the lung (46).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	283	The present study demonstrates a selective and significant increase in ETB gene and surface expression in and receptor binding by the hypertensive L2 cells compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Further confirmation of the increase in ETB receptors on hypertensive L2 cells is shown by our finding of an increase in early internalization of ET-1 by ETB.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Similar increases in ETB gene expression have been reported in the pulmonary arteries of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (44).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The ETB signaling pathway has been linked to the regulation of ppET-1 gene expression in rat mesangial cells (19).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The present study confirms this notion since, in a previous study, we showed that ppET-1 gene expression in the main pulmonary artery was decreased in hypertensive sheep compared with controls.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	288	Although our studies demonstrate that, in the short term, internalization and clearance of ET-1 by ETB in the hypertensive cells may be increased, our studies with the ETA and ETB receptor antagonists suggest that, in the longer term, this scenario does not occur.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Rather, our data demonstrate that ET-1-stimulated internalization of exogenous ET-1 is decreased in hypertensive L2 cells compared with controls and that the sensitivity of the individual ET-1 receptors is lost.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	290	 It is only when the ETA and ETB antagonists are added simultaneously that suppression of ET-1 uptake occurs.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Similar findings have been demonstrated in isolated perfused lungs from rats with hypoxic CPH (23).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	292	 One possible explanation for the failure of each antagonist alone to inhibit ET-1 uptake is that the concentration of antagonists used in the study was not sufficient to inhibit ETA and ETB receptors in hypertensive L2 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This would seem unlikely, because both antagonists failed to exert an inhibitory effect.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Another possibility is that phosphorylation of the receptor/ligand complex and/or receptor recycling are altered in the hypertensive cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This notion requires further study.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	296	Another possible explanation is that concurrent treatment with the ETA and ETB antagonists involves simultaneous activation and heterodimerization of the two receptors (26).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Recent studies suggest that ET-1 binds simultaneously to both an ETA and ETB receptor (2, 11).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	298	 This heterodimerization between two fully functional G protein-coupled receptors is suggested to result in a new receptor/ligand binding complex with functional properties different from those of either receptor alone (21).
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Thus it is possible that when the individual ETA and ETB receptors of hypertensive L2 cells are desensitized to exogenous ET-1, their simultaneous stimulation results in heterodimerization of ETA and ETB receptors and internalization of ET-1 by a different pathway.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This new pathway would seem to be extremely effective, since intracellular levels of ET-1 in the hypertensive L2 cells returned almost to basal values.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Further studies are needed to elucidate this possible explanation.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	302	In summary, we have shown that gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB, but not the ETA, receptors in L1 and L2 cells from control and hypertensive sheep are different.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Control and hypertensive L2 cells exhibit significantly higher steady-state basal expression of both the ETA and ETB genes than L1 cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In agreement with this finding, we found that only the L2 cells internalize exogenous ET-1.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In the short term, the ETA receptors are mainly responsible for binding of ET-1, but with longer exposure, both receptors contribute to internalization.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In hypertensive L2 cells, we showed that ETB gene and surface expression and Bmax by this receptor were significantly elevated above baseline.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Uptake of exogenous ET-1 by these cells, however, was less pronounced than in control cells.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Furthermore, we found that only concurrent treatment with both ETA and ETB antagonists suppressed ET-1 uptake in the hypertensive cells, suggesting an alteration in their structure.
0.16787788.12060559.html.plaintext.txt	309	 We conclude that changes in gene and surface expression and activity of the ETB receptors in L2 cells from hypertensive sheep may contribute to the development and maintenance of CPH through an altered sensitivity to locally produced ET-1.

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	12	Physalis mottle tymovirus (PhMV)1 is a small spherical plant virus consisting of a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome with a size of 6.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The RNA genome is encapsidated in a protein shell comprising 180 chemically identical coat protein (CP) subunits (20,000 Da) arranged in icosahedral symmetry.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Depending on the bonding interactions, the subunits are designated as A, B, and C (2).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The A-type subunits form pentamers at the 5-fold, and the B and C subunits form hexamers at the 3-fold icosahedral axes.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The protein subunits are held by strong protein-protein interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	17	Purified preparations of tymoviruses, including PhMV, consist of empty capsids (top component) in addition to the full capsids (bottom component) containing complete genomic RNA.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	18	 An interesting feature of tymoviruses is that empty capsids are also formed in vitro when the intact virus is subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle or when exposed to high temperatures, alkaline pH, or denaturants (3-6).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The presence of empty shells in vivo and in vitro suggests that the information required for error-free assembly is contained within the primary structure of protein subunits in these viruses.

0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	280	 This residue does not have any obvious intra-subunit interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The replacement of Arg with Gln can be done without short contact within the same subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	282	 However, its mutation to Gln led to the partially folded and assembly-incompetent protein.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	283	 These results further support the observation that the mutation of residues involved in multiple inter-subunit interactions disrupts subunit folding and particle assembly.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Even here, the uncompensated negative charge might interfere in the folding of the protein.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	285	Asp-83 and Ile-123, although not conserved among all tymoviruses, are involved in extensive interactions with residues from the other subunits (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The mutation of these two residues to alanine also led to the partially folded proteins that were assembly-incompetent.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	287	Tyr-67 is also conserved across the tymovirus group.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It is involved not only in inter-subunit interactions at C-C2 and B5-A, but also in intra-subunit hydrogen-bonding interactions.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Its mutation to alanine disrupts the hydrogen-bonding interaction at the quasi-2-fold axis.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	290	 This creates a cavity in the vicinity of residues Leu-34, Leu-63, Leu-180, and Ile-32.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This may have a destabilizing effect on the same subunit, which could hinder proper folding of the subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Hence, its mutation to Ala led to the misfolding of the subunits and the consequent arrest of assembly.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	293	Interestingly, the tertiary structure of the partially folded mutant proteins is similar to that of the rCP capsids (Figs.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The single tryptophan residue, Trp-96, is located inside the -barrel, and its mutation led to soluble aggregates defective in folding and assembly (8).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Furthermore, this Trp is not an interfacial residue.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Therefore, it is possible that the partially folded mutant rCPs and the wild type rCP have similar accessibility to this tryptophan.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	297	In contrast to the Q37E, Y67A, R68Q, D83A, and I123A mutant rCPs, the S145A mutant assembled into capsids that were indistinguishable from wild type rCP capsids.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	298	 An analysis of the intact PhMV capsid structure shows that Ser-145 has hydrogen-bonding interactions with Thr-149 and Asp-150 in the A-B interface, Ser-19 and Thr-149 at the A-C interface, and Asp-150 and Asn-139 at the B-C interface (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	299	 These interactions are presumably less important or are compensated by other interactions in the mutant rCP and thus do not affect the folding or assembly.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Earlier studies on D144N, N1881, and N188A mutant rCPs have shown that they do assemble into capsids, although these residues occur at the inter-subunit interfaces (8).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Thus, none of the mutant proteins studied thus far has resulted in a fully folded and assembly-competent monomeric subunit.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	302	 It is, however, possible that the mutant rCPs are not correctly folded when synthesized in vivo and hence are assembly incompetent.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	303	 To examine this, the wild type rCP capsids were incubated with 8 M urea for 4 h at room temperature and subjected to stepwise dialysis or immediate dilution (20-fold) to remove the denaturant.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, it was not possible to obtain assembled particles from such refolding mixtures.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Invariably, the removal of denaturant led to the complete precipitation of the protein.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Because it was not possible to refold and assemble the wild type rCP, similar experiments with mutant rCPs were not attempted.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	307	 In vivo studies on the related turnip yellow mosaic virus has shown that the coat protein synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in the cytoplasm overlying clustered vesicles in the chloroplast (17).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	308	 These become inserted into the outer chloroplast membrane with the hydrophobic sides that are normally buried in the complete virus particle within the lipid bilayer.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	309	 It is suggested that the nascent RNA strand emerges through the vesicle neck and that virus assembly takes place in the vesicular membrane (17).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Thus, the partially folded CP attached to the membrane, upon interaction with RNA, could further fold and assemble into mature capsids.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	311	 In the absence of RNA, these proteins might self-assemble to form empty capsids.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The results presented in this communication clearly demonstrate that the mutation of residues crucial for interfacial interactions disrupts subunit folding and assembly in the PhMV.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Furthermore, these mutants are partially folded and are probably locked in conformations that lack the signals/features that would allow them to assemble into T = 3 capsids.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	314	 The unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence, overlapped with the changes in the light scattering when wild type rCP capsids were denatured with urea, suggesting that disassembly and unfolding are also concerted (Fig.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Thus, there is a close connection between folding and assembly in PhMV.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	316	 In the flock house virus also, the disassembly and unfolding of the mature capsids was shown to be concerted (18).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Viral structural proteins, such as the herpes simplex virus triplex forming protein (VP23), when expressed in E.
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	318	 coli, are shown to exist predominantly in a molten globule state (19).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The P22 coat protein has also been shown to be quite flexible in solution (20).
0.20710783.12477730.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Thus, concerted coat protein folding and capsid assembly may be a general phenomenon in viruses stabilized predominantly by inter-subunit interactions.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	4	The inner lipoyl domain (L2) of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) 60-mer forms a Ca2+-dependent complex with the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) or its catalytic subunit, PDP1c, in facilitating large enhancements of the activities of PDP1 (10-fold) or PDP1c (6-fold).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	5	 L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c requires the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group and specificity residues that distinguish L2 from the other lipoyl domains (L1 in E2 and L3 in the E3-binding component).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The L2-surface structure contributing to binding was mapped by comparing the capacities of well folded mutant or lipoyl analog-substituted L2 domains to interfere with E2 activation by competitively binding to PDP1 or PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Our results reveal the critical importance of a regional set of residues near the lipoyl group and of the octanoyl but not the dithiolane ring structure of the lipoyl group.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	8	 At the other end of the lipoyl domain, substitution of Glu182 by alanine or glutamine removed L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c, and these substitutions for the neighboring Glu179 also greatly hindered complex formation (E179A  >  E179Q).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Among 11 substitutions in L2 at sites of major surface residue differences between the L1 and L2 domains, only the conversion of Val-Gln181 located between the critical Glu179 and Glu182 to the aligned Ser-Leu sequence of the L1 domain greatly reduced L2 binding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Certain modified L2 altered E2 activation of PDP1 differently than PDP1c, supporting significant impact of the regulatory PDP1r subunit on PDP1 binding to L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our results indicate hydrophobic binding via the extended aliphatic structure of the lipoyl group and required adjacent L2 structure anchor PDP1 by acting in concert with an acidic cluster at the other end of the domain.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	13	The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1 catalyzes the irreversible conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and reduction of NAD+ via the sequential action of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Mammalian PDC is organized around a central framework formed by assembly of 60 E2 subunits.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	15	 E2 consists of four independently folded domains connected to each other by mobile linker regions 20-30 amino acids in length (1-4).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Association of 20 trimer units of E2's C-terminal domain produces a central cavity in the shape of a dodecahedron.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	17	 At its surface, this assembled inner core is connected by the first linker region to a 5-kDa domain that binds the E1 component (5, 6); 20-30 E1 tetramers (22) are anchored per E2 60-mer (7).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Then, set off by two more linker regions in the E2 structure, are two ~10-kDa lipoyl domains: an interior one, L2, and an NH2-terminal one, L1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	19	 An E3-binding protein (E3BP) has a multidomain structure similar to E2 consisting of three linker region-connected globular domains (8, 9).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The C-terminal domain of E3BP binds E2's inner domain followed with intervening linker regions first by the domain that binds E3 and then by a single lipoyl domain (designated L3) at the N terminus (5, 8-10, 12-14).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	21	Mammalian PDC is tightly regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, which determines the proportion of active (nonphosphorylated) E1 (2-4, 15).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	22	 PDC inactivation of E1 is carried out by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and reactivation by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	23	 PDC is regulated by at least four PDK isoforms and by two PDP isoforms, which are variably expressed in different tissues (16-20).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In Ca2+-sensitive tissues, the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) is the dominant phosphatase isoform (20).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	25	 PDP1 catalyzes a Mg2+-requiring, Ca2+-stimulated dephosphorylation and activation of E1 (15, 21, 22).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PDP1 activity is enhanced manyfold when the phosphorylated E1 and PDP1 are bound by the E2 60-mer (23, 24).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Indeed, Ca2+ stimulation requires E2 because PDP1 binds to E2 via an interaction that requires Ca2+ (23) at micromolar levels (22).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The magnitude of this enhancement (typically 7-16-fold) primarily depends on the level of free phosphorylated E1 in the absence of E2 because kinetically it results in a near saturated activity in the presence of E2 being compared with an activity that varies greatly with the level of phosphorylated E1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Thus, there is a major decrease in the apparent Km of PDP1 for phosphorylated E1 upon concentrating PDP1 along with phosphorylated E1 at the surface of the E2 core (23).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Ca2+ also causes an ~2-fold decrease in the Km of PDP1 for Mg2+ (25).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	31	PDP1 is composed of two subunits (26, 27).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Its catalytic subunit (PDP1c, mass = 52.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	33	6 kDa) is in the phosphatase 2C class but shares only ~20% sequence identity with rat cytosolic  and  isoforms of phosphatase 2C (28).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The other subunit (PDP1r, mass = 96 kDa) serves a regulatory role by elevating the concentration of Mg2+ required for efficient PDP1c catalysis (29).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The PDP1r subunit is a flavoprotein with a bound FAD; the sequence of PDP1r is distantly related to the mitochondrial flavoprotein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (30), which functions in choline degradation.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Spermine and, to a lesser degree, other polyamines reduce the Km of PDP1 for Mg2+ (31), probably by binding to PDP1r to reverse the effect of this subunit in elevating the Mg2+ responsiveness (29).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The PDP2 isoform has an even higher Km for Mg2+, which is reduced from  > 15 mM to 3 mM by direct interaction of spermine with recombinantly produced PDP2 that consists just of a catalytic subunit.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Rat PDP2 shares 55% sequence identity with rat PDP1c, but PDP2 is not activated by Ca2+ (20).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	39	 A similar diminution in the concentration dependence of PDP activity for Mg2+ is produced by insulin and sustained in permeabilized mitochondria prepared from insulin-treated adipose tissue (32).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This probably involves a change in the activity of PDP2, which is located in adipose tissue (20).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	41	The L2 domain of E2 selectively binds PDP1 by an association that specifically engages L2's lipoyl prosthetic group (33, 34).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	42	 PDP1 does not interact productively with the L1 domain of E2 (33, 34) or with the lipoyl domain of E3BP (reported herein).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	43	 PDP1c, alone, undergoes Ca2+-dependent binding and activation (28) via an association with the L2 domain (Ref.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Using gel-anchored GST-L2, Ca2+-aided binding has been used to selectively purify PDP1 (33) and PDP1c (35).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Ca2+ does not bind to either PDP1c or the L2, alone; binding requires the combination of the catalytic subunit and the free lipoyl domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	46	2 This suggests either a bridging role of Ca2+ between L2 and PDP1c or a stepwise interaction in which Ca2+ stabilizes the complex by binding at a site induced by a precursory (weaker) interaction between PDP1c and the L2 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	47	To understand and compare the lipoyl-domain specific, Ca2+-dependent binding of the L2 domain to PDP1 and PDP1c, we have mapped the effects of changes in the L2 structure both by site-specific changes in surface amino acid residues and by substitution of analogs of the lipoyl prosthetic group.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Our results reveal the importance of residues near the lipoyl group and the hydrophobic character of the lipoyl group as well as the critical contribution of specific acidic residues at the opposite half of the folded domain that are separated by required, L2 domain-specific sequence.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Because PDP1 purified only through the DEAE-column step (27) is more stable than the highly purified PDP1 prepared by affinity chromatography using GST-L2, most assays of PDP1 employed PDP1 from this less purified fraction (40-50% PDP1 based both on PDP1 specific activity and staining patterns after SDS-PAGE).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Reed and PDP1c prepared by modification of the procedure described by Choi et al.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The primary modification was that extracts of PDP1c were allowed to interact with the GST-L2 anchored on GSH-Sepharose overnight at 4 degrees C prior to washing and then eluting by Ca2+ chelation using EGTA.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	58	 From 10 g of cells, 25-30 mg of nearly homogeneous PDP1c was routinely obtained.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	59	 L2, mutant L2, nonlipoylated L2, and L2 with lipoate analogs enzymatically attached to nonlipoylated L2 were prepared as previously described (38-40).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The sequences of mutated cDNA for expressing new L2 mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Newly developed mutant L2 domains were evaluated as substrates in the E1 and E3 reactions and by differential scanning calorimetry as previously described (38, 39).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Based on patterns in native gel and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the lipoyl domains were 99% pure with the inclusion of very low levels of bands (native gel pattern) corresponding to nonlipoylated L2 (38, 39).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Lipoyl domain concentrations were based on their calculated absorbance at 280 nm with appropriate adjustments when tyrosine residues were mutated as previously described (38).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Assays, in which either a phosphatase source or Mg2+ were not added, gave similar negligible backgrounds, which were subtracted from the above activities.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Using this standard assay procedure and 10 mM Mg2+, PDP1 (DEAE-purified) had a specific activity in the range of 500-650 nmol min1 mg1 and PDP1c had specific activities in the range of 1300-1600 nmol min1 mg1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In the limited studies in which the free Ca2+ level was controlled by EGTA-Ca buffer, the level of free Ca2+ was calculated as previously described (36) with appropriate corrections for Mg2+ binding and for Ca2+ contamination in reagents.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	76	All assays were conducted at least in duplicate with control assays (no lipoyl domain present) conducted in duplicate at the beginning and end of the series of assays.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The deviations from the average values for the control, E2-activated PDP1 or PDP1c activities, were normally within  plus or minus 4% of the average value.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Somewhat higher percentile, but usually lower absolute deviations (typical data shown in Figs.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	79	 8 and 9) were observed for the average values for the lower (well inhibited) rates.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Given these deviations, the percentage of inhibition values shown in the tables (a difference of the average control rate and an average inhibited rate) could be as high as  plus or minus 7% so that 5% inhibition is within experimental error little or no inhibition.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	81	 With a given PDCb substrate, the average percentage of inhibition values obtained for a specific L2 construct in different experiments fell within these deviations and the trends (strong to weak inhibition) were invariant with all PDCb substrates.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, the absolute percentage of inhibition by various L2 structures (including wild-type L2) varied somewhat more with different PDCb substrates.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Tables I, II, and IV combine data from several experiments.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The data are normalized as described in the legend to Table I for convenient comparison of the trends that were repeatedly observed.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	85	When a full analysis of L2 inhibition of E2 activation of PDP activity was analyzed over a range of L2 concentrations, the data were fit assuming that the fraction of PDP bound to E2 operates at the maximum rate and the fraction of PDP bound to L2 operating at the minimum rate (Vmin) so v = Vmax[PDPt  L2 PDP]/[PDPt] + Vmin[L2 PDP]/[PDPt].
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (The [PDPt] in the denominator of the first term on the right was not correctly entered previously (33).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	87	) For the series of L2 levels used, the L2 PDP concentrations were estimated from the best iterative fitting of a data set to the optimum ratio of dissociation constants for binding of PDP by L2 versus E2 (r = Kd(L2)/Kd(E2)) and the optimum Vmin (33) along with assuming that free phosphatase is negligible.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	88	 All assays were conducted with saturating levels of phosphorylated PDC (i.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	89	 higher rates were not observed at higher levels) and, therefore, maximal binding of PDP1 or PDP1c to E2 is supported.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	99	 1C) has a prominent hydrophobic face (yellow residues) and a mixture of acidic and basic residues.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	100	 A C-terminal lobe and N-terminal segment protrude from the domain at the opposite end from the lipoylation loop; these segments were not found to be stably folded in the structure determined by NMR (41).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	101	 However, these terminal regions are distinct from their adherent Ala-Pro-rich linker regions; mutation of specific residues in these terminal regions affects the thermal unfolding of the domain (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Previously, a set of single-residue substitutions in the L2 domain were made for prominent amino acids located at strategic positions on the surface of the L2 domain (38); we initially screened the effects of those characterized mutants on L2 binding to PDP1, and, based on that initial screening, additional L2 mutants were made to achieve the following goals.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	117	Our objectives were to map the surface of the L2 domain and its prosthetic group to determine surface features that are important for binding of PDP1 and PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Because the lipoyl prosthetic group is required for binding (33), a large number of residues at the lipoylated end of the domain as well as structure within the prosthetic group were investigated.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	119	 One goal was to detect acidic residues that may directly contribute to Ca2+-dependent binding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Another goal was to detect structural features of the L2 domain that contribute to the highly preferential binding of PDP1 to the L2 domain rather than the closely related L1 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The L3 domain, which is less closely related, is completely ineffective in inhibiting E2 activation or in binding PDP1 when gel-anchored GST-L3 was tested (data not shown).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Finally, we have sought to determine whether there were differences in the profiles of mutant-induced changes in L2 binding to holo-PDP1 as compared with just the catalytic subunit, PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Differences suggest that the 96-kDa PDP1r either contributes to specific binding or alters the conformation of PDP1c to affect its binding to L2.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	131	Comparison of Inhibition of PDP1 and PDP1c by Wild-type L2-- As indicated in the Introduction, PDP1 and PDP1c bind the L2 domain of E2 in a Ca2+-dependent association that greatly increases phosphatase activity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Competitive binding of the free L2 domain to PDP1 reduces phosphatase activity by preventing PDP1 binding to the L2 domain of the E2 component, which also anchors the phosphorylated E1 substrate (33).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	133	 3 compares the capacity of increasing concentrations of the wild-type L2 domain to prevent E2-activation of PDP1 and PDP1c activity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	134	 As was previously described (33), the data in Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	135	 3 were fit by a curve developed by iterative fitting with variation in the relative ratio of binding dissociation constants for E2 subunits versus free L2 along with variation in Vmin = maximally inhibited rate when PDP is all bound to L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Vmin was estimated as 9% Vmax, which indicates that the maximal inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 activity is projected to be 91%.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Half of this maximal inhibition was realized at 4.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This value is higher than the value reported previously (33), in part, because the method for measuring the protein concentration of purified L2 (A280 nm rather than the BCA assay) gives 1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, we have observed nearly a 2-fold variation in the concentration giving half-maximal inhibition (3-6  microM) primarily caused by variation in the phosphorylated PDC substrate (the phosphorylated PDC used for the experiment shown in Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Half of the estimated maximal inhibition (85%, Vmin = 15% Vmax) of E2-activated PDP1c activity was reached at a somewhat higher L2 level of 8.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Again in separate experiments with different phosphorylated PDC, this value ranged from 6 to 11  microM.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Although the concentrations giving half of the maximal inhibitions of PDP1 and PDP1c have varied with different phosphorylated PDC preparations, the trend comparing PDP1 and PDP1c of higher L2 being required to give half-maximal inhibition of PDP1c and a lesser maximal inhibition of PDP1c were repeatedly observed.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The greater inhibition of PDP1 is consistent with competitively hindering a greater activation by E2-E3BP of ~10-fold with PDP1 activity (23, 33, 34) but only ~6-fold with PDP1c (28).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	144	2 Indeed, the extrapolated PDP1 or PDP1c Vmin rates appear to be nearly equivalent to activities that have been observed in assays of PDP1 (33) or PDP1c using the same level of phosphorylated E1 in the absence of E2.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	156	Effects of Mutant and Modified L2 in the Region near the Lipoyl Group-- All the mutant L2 tested at the lipoylated end of the L2 domain were well behaved, and only L140A-L2 had a midpoint transition temperature for thermal melting (Tm value) below 63  degrees C (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Even that construct was well lipoylated, gave a single band in native gel electrophoresis with a rate of migration that was the same as wild type L2, and gave a single reversible transition (Tm = 56  degrees C) under conditions of thermal unfolding (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	158	Several of these substitutions located in L2 at or near the site of lipoylation led to substantial changes (mostly decreases) in the capacity of free L2 structures to compete with the L2 domains of the E2 60-mer to, thereby, hinder E2 activation of PDP1 or PDP1c activity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Table I presents data comparing this capacity for 6 or 12  microM wild-type or mutant L2 which have modifications introduced in the lipoylated end of L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Not only did prevention of lipoylation by the K173A mutation greatly hinder PDP1 binding to L2 but substitution of both residues flanking the lipoylation site, D172N and A174S mutations, greatly reduced competitive binding to PDP1 or PDP1c by those well lipoylated L2 mutants (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, the A174S mutation was significantly more effective in blocking activation of PDP1 than PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Alanine substitution for Leu140, which is located in the E1-specificity loop, blocked binding to PDP1 and PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This exposed hydrophobic side chain probably makes a significant direct contribution to PDP1 binding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The large effect suggests that replacement of Leu140 with alanine might also alter the capacity of neighboring residues to productively interact with PDP.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, alanine substitution for the adjacent Ser141 in the center of the E1-specificity loop did not change L2 binding to PDP1.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	169	 For the data incorporated in this table, wild type L2 reduced E2-activation of PDP1 by 45-56% at 6  microM L2 from 65-71% at 12  microM L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Similar variation occurred with the normalized data for PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Values were rounded to the nearest percentage except when the value shown was within 0.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	172	Although most consequential substitutions in L2 reduced the level of inhibition of E2 activation of PDP1, two mutant L2, T143A and R196Q, repeatedly gave enhanced potencies relative to native L2 in reducing E2 activation, suggesting that these substitutions produced domains with an increased affinity for PDP1.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This mutant L2 was similarly effective in decreasing E2 enhancement of the activity of PDP1c (Table I).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	176	 4 demonstrate that this reflects a stronger affinity of T143A-L2 than wild type L2 for PDP1 with little or no change in the maximal inhibition.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Similar results were obtained with PDP1c (data not shown).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	178	Equivalent effects with PDP1 and PDP1c were not found with the L2 construct in which glutamine was substituted for Arg196, a prominent residue extending forward on the hydrophobic side of the lipoyl domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Repeated experiments (including an assay set that evaluated PDP1 and PDP1c simultaneously) supported a slightly enhanced capacity of R196Q-L2 to lessen E2 activation of PDP1 activity while exhibiting a somewhat reduced capacity for limiting activation of PDP1c by E2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Because both the A174S and R196Q mutants affected E2 activation of PDP1 and PDP1c differently, this suggests that PDP1r subunit influences PDP1 binding to L2; further support of this trend is provided below.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	181	Substitution of alanine for Asp197, which is adjacent to Arg196, had little effect on PDP1 binding to L2, whereas this substitution had a marked effect in reducing L2 activation of PDK3.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	182	3 Conversion of Thr145, which is located between Thr143 and Arg196, to alanine modestly diminished the capacity for competitively lowering E2 activation of PDP1 and PDP1c activity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thr145 is replaced by a glutamine in the L1 domain and by a glutamate in the L3 domain, but the limited effect of the T145A mutation indicates that Thr145 makes no more than a minor contribution to the high binding specificity of the L2 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	184	Overall, this analysis of the amino acid residues located at the surface of the lipoylated end of L2 indicate that the conserved lipoyl-bearing turn and Leu140 specificity loop are particularly important contributors to the association of PDP1 and PDP1c with L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Although playing a pivotal role, none of the critical residues are likely candidates for directly liganding to Ca2+ nor can they provide an explanation for the high binding specificity for L2 over the L1 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	186	Substitutions within the Lipoyl Prosthetic Group-- To determine what features are important within the lipoyl-lysine side chain, Lys173 was additionally replaced by Gln, Met, and Leu and the lipoyl group was replaced by lipoate analogs.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Like the alanine substitution, the other amino acid substitutions for Lys173 greatly reduced or eliminated the capacity of L2 to bind PDP1 (Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These results establish that the lipoyl-lysine makes a major contribution to this interaction that cannot be met by amino acid side chains that can engage in hydrophobic interactions (Met or Leu) or form H-bonds (Gln).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Indeed, octanoyl-L2 appears to be as effective as L2 in which the lipoyl group was introduced by lipoyl protein ligase treatment.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Octanoyl-L2 was similarly effective with PDP1c (data not shown).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Apparently, the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl group is not particularly important, but the hydrocarbon character of the lipoate is crucial for maintaining binding, probably by directly interacting at a hydrophobic region of PDP1c structure.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In contrast to this outcome, none of these modifications supported significant binding to E1 (38), and, whereas 8-thiol-octanoyl-L2 directly activates PDK3 very effectively, the octanoyl-L2 gives only a very small enhancement of PDK3 activity and heptanoyl-L2 gives no activation.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Only two substitutions reduced Tm values for thermal unfolding below 61  degrees C.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These included alanine substitution for Leu190, which has a well exposed side chain centered in the middle of the cluster of hydrophobic amino acids, and for Phe217 in the C-terminal tail.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Both were well lipoylated and effectively used in the E1 reaction.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Although those results support considerable retention of native structure, the L190A and F217A constructs, besides having reduced Tm values, had a tendency to form dimer aggregates in native gel electrophoresis.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Based on these findings, it was suggested that reversible interaction of the C-terminal region and the hydrophobic face involve Phe217 interacting with Leu190 (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	210	Among the mutated surface residues at this end of the domain, competitive binding was not significantly changed from that of wild type L2 with the Q134A, V156A, K188A, L190A, D219N, R221Q, and E224Q mutants (data not shown).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Significant differences were observed for the mutations shown in Table II.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	212	 A marked reduction in inhibiting PDP1 and PDP1c activation was observed with the E179A mutation.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Reductions in PDP1 activation were also observed with the Y129A, Q181A, and D213N mutants and to a smaller extent with E162A and Y220A mutations.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The reproducible effects of the C-terminal D213N and Y220A and N-terminal Y129A mutants on PDP1 were not detected with PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This adds further support to differences in the binding of PDP1 and PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Given the tendency of F217A-L2 to aggregate, the modest reduction with this modification in the C terminus cannot be considered conclusive, even though it was observed with PDP1 and PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, the L190A mutation, which had a tendency to form dimer aggregates (38) similar to that of the F217A mutant, retained native L2 capacity to bind PDP1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Overall, these data suggest that the C- and N-terminal lobes make a greater contribution to the Ca2+-aided binding when PDP1r is associated with PDP1c.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Glu179 is located in a cluster of acidic residues that includes not only Glu162 but also glutamate residues at positions 182, 183, 209, and 211.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	224	 All these Glu residues except Glu183, which has the least exposed side chain in the NMR structure (41), were converted to alanine.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Glu209 and Glu211 were of particular interest both because they are near Asp213 for which alanine substitution caused some reduction in inhibitory binding (Table II) but also because the aligned sequence of the L1 domain does not have acidic residues at these positions (Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	226	 To further assess the importance of Glu179, it was converted to Gln and Glu182 was also converted to Gln based on results below.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Because alanine substitution of Tyr129 in the N terminus reduced E2 activation of PDP1 and a leucine residue is located at this position in the L1 domain, a Y129L mutant was made.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Finally, with a greater focus on this area around Glu179-Glu182 and to sort what distinguishes the structure of the L2 domain from the L1 domain, Val180-Gln181 was replaced by Ser-Leu, which is found at the aligned positions also located between two glutamates in the L1 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	229	 This double substitution results in a reversal from a hydrophobic residue followed by a hydrophilic one to the opposite order.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Amino acid residues 179-181 are in a -strand in L2, with the hydrophobic Val180 side chain facing into the interior of the domain and Gln181 projecting out from the surface (Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	231	 With the change in polarity with the introduction of the Ser-Leu sequence, it is unlikely that there is a reversal in the positioning of those side chains in the -strand because of the need to maintain exposure of Glu179 in L2 or the aligned Glu52 in L1; each was shown to be an important specificity residue for the E1 reaction (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	232	All these mutant L2 were used in the E3 reaction at the same rate as fully lipoylated wild-type L2, establishing full lipoylation.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	234	 As expected, the conversion of Glu179 to glutamine greatly reduced the use of L2 as a substrate in the E1 reaction (Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	235	 With the Glu182 mutants, the E1 reaction was slowed on average by 58% with E182A-L2 and by 63% with E182Q-L2 (Fig.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Surprisingly, the V180S/Q181L mutant was a somewhat improved E1 substrate, giving 22% higher rates at both concentrations.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This indicates that the key specificity residue Glu179 (38) is still interacting well with E1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Also supporting that conclusion, each of these mutant L2 gave a single tight band in native gel electrophoresis with an expected (small) decreases in mobilities (38) for those mutants in which a negative charge was removed (data not shown).

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This higher stability of the E182A and E182Q mutants can be largely explained by the resulting reduction of electrostatic repulsion with neighboring acidic residues (particularly to Glu162 and Glu183, but also with Glu179), which would be expected to stabilize folding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The decrease in the entropy difference between the folded and unfolded E179Q mutant domain versus that observed with native L2 is consistent with greater freedom of movement in the cluster of acidic side chains in the folded domain as was also observed with the E179A mutant (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	252	 However, this was not observed with the Glu182 mutations (Table III); indeed, with E182Q, a significant increase in entropy is indicated.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In contrast, the Y129L mutant has thermal melting properties very close to native L2, the hydrophobic character of the Tyr129 is apparently important for local interactions that limit movement of the N-terminal segment.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Conversion of Glu179 to glutamine still reduced competitive binding of PDP1 and PDP1c but did not appear to be as potent as the E179A modification (Table II).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	265	 That was confirmed by a direct comparison of these two substitutions in the same assay set with PDP1 and PDP1c that evaluated higher levels of lipoyl domains.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The increase in inhibition of PDP1 for a change from 6 to 18  microM lipoyl domain was from 10 to 33% for E179A but from 26 to 53% for E179Q (from 51 to 73% for wild type L2).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The corresponding increase in inhibition of activation of PDP1c was from 6 to 19% for E179A but from 18 to 41% for E179Q (from 40 to 67% for wild type L2).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Thus, the polarized amide group with glutamine substituted yields a mutant L2 that binds with ~3-fold weaker affinity than wild type L2 and the alanine substitution effects nearly another 3-fold decrease in affinity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	269	 These results are consistent with the possibility that the amide oxygen of the glutamine side chain via its negative dipole could contribute to a weaker interaction than the native glutamate with a positively charged region of PDP1c.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Although the combination of Glu211 and the conserved Asp213 might contribute to specific PDP1 binding to L2, the selective substitution of these residues had modest impacts; furthermore, the D213N mutant was not very effective in inhibiting E2 activation of PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Conversion of Tyr129 to leucine as found in L1 gave results significantly different from the Y129A mutation in retaining excellent competitive binding to PDP1 and PDP1c (Table IV).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	283	 With the Y129A mutant, increased flexibility of the N-terminal segment (see DSC consideration above) may somehow interfere with lipoyl domain binding to PDP1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	284	Although glutamate is maintained in the L1 domain at the aligned positions for residues 179 and 182 of L2, the intervening residues are quite distinct as emphasized above.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The V180S/Q181L mutation to make L2 more like L1 substantially reduced competitive binding of L2 to PDP1, and this change was extremely potent in preventing binding to PDP1c (Table IV).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	286	 We would note that the single site Q181A mutation had a significant but substantially smaller effect (Table II) in reducing competitive binding so that removal of critical H-bonding is insufficient for explaining the large effect of the double mutation.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The dual mutation had only a favorable effect on the E1 reaction for which Glu179; the aligned residue (Glu52) in L1 is also critically important for the E1 reaction (38).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Because Glu182 is clearly very important for PDP1 and PDP1c binding by L2, the combination of results suggests that the preceding Val-Gln provides structure that helps to properly position Glu182 to participate effectively in the binding of PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	289	Limiting Ca2+-- The above studies were conducted at saturating Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The effects of wild type L2 and two mutant L2 (E179A and A174S) that gave strong but only partial inhibition of PDP1c4 were compared at saturating and limiting Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	291	 E2-activated PDP1c activity was 64% of that at saturating Ca2+ with 3.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The fractional inhibition at both 3.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	293	8  microM Ca2+ and saturating Ca2+ levels was ~60% by 18  microM wild type L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	294	 18  microM E179A-L2 caused ~18% inhibition at saturating and 14% inhibition at 3.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Thus, the effectiveness relative to wild type L2 of competition by E179A-L2 in reducing E2 activation of PDP1c was not significantly reduced at the lower level of Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	296	 At the lipoylated end of the domain, the same relative decrease in PDP1c activation by 18  microM A174S-L2 mutation (30%) versus wild type (60%) was observed with saturating or limiting Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Overall these data indicate that, once formed, the complexes of PDP1c with E179A-L2 or A174S-L2 retain a high affinity for Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Thus, these mutations at consequential but secondary sites in the regions of L2 that play decisive roles in complex formation do not directly affect Ca2+ binding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Nonetheless, these data do not eliminate the possibility that Glu182 contributes directly or indirectly to the high affinity of the L2-PDP1c complex for Ca2+, an interest that could not be similarly investigated because high levels of L2 mutants substituted at Glu182 gave little, if any, inhibition.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The results below indicate that this was because of complete removal or extraordinarily weak binding to PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	301	Requirement for Two Binding Regions in L2-- As described elsewhere,2 analytical ultracentrifuge studies detected binding of L2 to PDP1c at high concentrations only in the presence of free Ca2+ and a signal for Ca2+ binding was detected only for the combination of L2 and PDP1c in ITC experiments.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	302	 These findings suggested the possibility that weaker Ca2+-dependent binding by nonlipoylated or Glu182-modified L2 might be observed by ITC.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	303	 That would allow the interactions of the two regions of L2 to be independently analyzed and the importance of Glu182 in Ca2+-dependent binding to be evaluated.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, using much higher levels of PDP1c (20  microM) with 40  microM either K173A-L2 or E182A-L2, no detectable Ca2+ binding was observed in ITC studies.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	305	 These data further support the critical contribution of the combination of the two binding regions for Ca2+-dependent L2-PDP1c complex formation; however, these findings limit approaches that can be used for independently dissecting the roles of the two regions of L2 in binding PDP1 or PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	306	 8 shows the location of the residues whose modification significantly altered binding of the L2 domain with PDP1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Our results indicate that there are two major regions of interaction within the L2 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The first region includes the lipoyl prosthetic group and neighboring residues.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Substitution of the adjacent residues, D172N and A174A, greatly hindered binding as does the L140A substitution in the E1-specificity loop.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	310	 T143A substitution in the E1-specificity loop enhanced L2 binding to PDP1 and PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Based on effective binding by octanoyl-L2 but not by several Lys173-substituted or nonlipoylated L2, the lipoyl cofactor probably interacts at an extended hydrophobic pocket in the surface structure of PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	312	 In contrast, the dithiolane ring character of the lipoyl prosthetic group is decisive for L2 binding to E1 (38) and 8-thiol is crucial for L2 activation of PDK3.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	313	3 We suggest that the interactions of PDP1 at the lipoylated end of the L2 domain make a significant contribution to binding affinity but do not contribute to lipoyl domain specificity.

0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The red label indicates a gain rather than a loss in binding affinity upon mutation.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	318	The second region involves interactions at the other end of the L2 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The large effect of mutations of Glu182 in hindering binding of PDP1 and PDP1c to the L2 domain suggests that this acidic residue performs a key role in binding.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	320	 8, a distinct pocket exists in the center of the fully protruding Glu182, Gln181, Glu179, and Glu162 side chains; binding interactions that remove the mutual repulsion by the three acidic residues should be favored.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Because mutation of all these residues hindered L2 binding to PDP1, an appealing prospect is that these form a strong electrostatic interaction with a positively charged regions of PDP1c.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	322	 An aspect of this might directly involve Ca2+ binding particularly to Glu182.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	323	 However, the finding that the E179A mutation fails to have a greater impact in restricting competitive binding in the presence of limiting Ca2+ makes this possibility less likely.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Although our results support the critical importance of Glu182, only a complete three-dimensional structure can establish how these proteins interact.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Further, isolation of binding regions by indirect approaches will be difficult to obtain because weak binding to PDP1c was not detected in biophysical studies performed on either nonlipoylated or Glu182 mutated L2 even in the presence of Ca2+.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	326	Toward understanding the high specificity of PDP1 for the L2 domain, we expressly eliminated or found minimal contributions of several residues that differ in the L2 domain from the aligned residues in the L1 domain.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	327	 However, the conversion of the residues preceding Glu182 from Val-Gln sequence to the Ser-Leu sequence found in L1 substantially reduced binding of PDP1 to L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	328	 A logical explanation is that the native Ser-Leu residues of L1 do not allow the corresponding Glu55 side chain to be properly positioned for abetting binding of L1 to PDP1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The positioning of Glu179 may also be slightly altered by the Ser-Leu substitution, but there was no unfavorable impact on the E1 reaction resulting from any change in positioning of this key residue for the E1 reaction and for PDK3 activation, which was also well maintained.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	330	For the most part, PDP1 and PDP1c binding to the L2 domain were altered in a similar manner by the same modifications of the L2 structure, but five single site mutants (A174S and R196Q at the lipoylated end of L2, D213N and Y220A in the C-terminal lobe, and Y129A in the N-terminal segment) had greater effects with PDP1 than PDP1c in removing their influence on E2-activated phosphatase activity.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Among these, the most pronounced differences between PDP1 and PDP1c binding were observed with A174S.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The A174S mutation rendered binding to PDP1 almost undetectable while only reducing inhibition of PDP1c to roughly half that of wild type L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This mutant L2 is well lipoylated and a fairly good E1 substrate (60% of wild type L2).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Upon substitution of the buried Ala174 side chain, which faces the E1-specificity loop, the hydroxyl group of serine may amend allowed conformations of that somewhat flexible outer structure (41).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Whatever the change, the interaction with PDP1 is much more sensitive than PDP1c, indicating that the presence of the PDP1r subunit of PDP1 places a demand for a more precise interaction.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	336	 In the opposite direction to the above single site mutations, the V180S/Q181L mutant had a potent effect in eliminating detectable binding with PDP1c but not as strong a reduction with PDP1.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	337	 This indicates either that, without PDP1r, PDP1c requires more structural precision at this end of the domain or that additional binding interactions resulting from the presence of PDP1r in PDP1 compensate to some extent for the loss of interactions because of the small but pivotal conformational adjustments elicited by the double mutation.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	338	A sequence firmly supporting a Ca2+-binding EF-hand is not apparent in either PDP1c or L2.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	339	 One distantly related acidic region mutated in PDP1c interfered with Ca2+-dependent binding (42).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	340	 However, the local sequence, including the mutated residue, is conserved in the PDP2 isoform, although the activity of PDP2 is not influenced by Ca2+ (20).
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Thus, PDP1c-L2 complex formation creates a tight site for binding Ca2+ that probably does not involve an EF-hand.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Because binding to PDP1 engages and requires domain-aided hydrophobic binding by the exterior lipoyl group at one end of L2 and electrostatic binding by the opposite end of the L2 domain, it seems likely that these essential regions of L2 act with a coordinated purpose.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	343	 An appealing prospect is that these two interactions foster and stabilize a conformational change in PDP1c that produces a Ca2+ binding site.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Expending binding energy by inducing such a change would explain why such an extensive interaction surface of the L2 domain is needed to effect a net affinity that is only at the micromolar level.
0.25463712.11842080.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Further insight into the constitution of the Ca2+-dependent complexes formed between L2 and PDP1 or PDP1c will require detailed structures that will probably depend on crystallizing these complexes.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The role of the intrinsic immunity in controlling HPV infection and the subsequent development of SILs is shown indirectly by the increased frequency of HPV-associated lesions in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity (Petry et al.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The study of the interactions between HPV and DC or LC has been complicated by the fact that native infectious HPV virions cannot be isolated in large enough quantities either in vitro or in vivo.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	127	  To study the cell entry kinetics, DC and LC were first incubated with labelled VLPs at 4  degrees C, washed and then incubated at 37  degrees C for 5, 10, 30, 60 min and 6 h (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	128	 After a trypsin treatment to remove uninternalized VLPs and washings, cells were incubated at 37  degrees C for 6 h.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	132	 With increased incubation times, differences between the two cell populations decreased and at 6 h of incubation 84 plus or minus 12 % of DC and 94 plus or minus 1 % of LC were fluorescent.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The faster VLPs entry in LC compared with DC was confirmed by electron microscopy (see Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	140	  HPV 16 VLPs use heparan sulfates to bind to DC Since the difference observed in entry kinetics between DC and LC could be explained by the use of different types of cell binding, we investigated if heparan sulfates are used by VLPs to enter into DC or LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We first examined the ability of heparin to block binding and cell entry.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Labelled HPV 16 VLPs were preincubated with heparin for 1 h at 37  degrees C and their capacity to enter into DC or LC was investigated by cell fluorescence (Table 1).
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In the presence of heparin, fluorescence was inhibited by 76 plus or minus 5 % in DC whereas no inhibition (12 plus or minus 2 %) was observed with LC (Table 1).
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	144	 To determine if this difference was not due to the origin of cells used to induce the differentiation of DC and LC, we also generated DC with CD34+ cells and showed that the entry of VLPs was inhibited in the presence of heparin (51 plus or minus 13 % of inhibition), suggesting that heparan sulfates are receptors for DC but not for LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	145	 We also investigated the heparan sulfates expression by immunostaining with anti-human syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 antibodies.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	153	 For this purpose, LC and DC were grown in the presence of sodium chlorate for 48 h before the addition of labelled VLPs.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	154	 As shown in Table 1, HPV 16 VLPs entry was reduced by 71 plus or minus 5 % in DC treated with 100  microM sodium chlorate compared with untreated cells.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In contrast, only a 13 plus or minus 2 % inhibition was detected in LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	156	 To confirm the role of heparan sulfate in the DC entry of VLPs, DC were incubated with heparinase II, which induced a 51 % infection inhibition in DC whereas LC were not affected (data not shown).
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	157	Langerin is colocalized with HPV 16 VLPs Since VLPs did not enter in LC by heparan sulfates and VLPs entry was faster in LC, we investigated if VLPs use the same method as langerin (CD207), an endocytic receptor in LC, to enter quickly into LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Electron microscopy analysis showed that after an incubation at 37  degrees C for 5 min, anti-langerin mAb were present in LC in coated pits (Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	185	, 2003), we examined the role of clathrin-coated-pit-mediated endocytosis in the entry of HPV 16 VLPs in LC and DC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These cells were preincubated with chlorpromazine, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	187	 A 70 % inhibition in HPV 16 VLPs endocytosis was observed in both DC and LC populations after chlorpromazine treatment (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	188	 We also tested the effect of cytochalasin D, a potent inhibitor of actin-dependent cellular processes.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In the presence of this drug, VLP fluorescence was shown to decrease (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	190	 LC and DC were also treated with nystatin and filipin, which inhibit caveolae-mediated endocytosis and no inhibition was observed with these drugs (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	191	 To visually analyse the uptake of HPV VLPs into DC and LC, transmission electron microscopy analysis was also performed.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In the presence of HPV 16 VLPs, DC and LC plasma membranes were rich in coated pits where VLPs accumulated (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These coated pits budded off to yield coated vesicles with clathrin morphology confirming that HPV enter by endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits in both DC (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	194	 VLPs were contained in cytoplasmic coated vesicles (Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The HPV 16 VLPs remained clustered in large vesicles resembling endosome (Fig.

0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	200	When using VLP at low concentration (0 2  microg ml to 1), they were also observed in coated pits and cytoplasmic vesicles of LC with a clathrin morphology (Fig.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	201	   DISCUSSION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   HPV 16 VLP-based vaccine formulations have been shown to induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity and to confer protection against HPV 16-related SILs (Koutsky et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These data suggest that vaccine antigens are efficiently presented to the immune system and may be correlated to the ability of HPV VLPs to activate DC (Rudolf et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	203	 (2002) demonstrated that SILs are deficient in presenting antigens to T cells suggesting that the function of LC is incapacitated in the HPV-transformed epithelium.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In agreement with these observations, Fausch et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	205	 (2002) demonstrated that LC in the presence of HPV 16 VLPs are unable to activate T cells.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	206	The purpose of the present report was to investigate further the interactions between HPV 16 VLPs and DC or LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We showed that these antigen-presenting cells differentially interact with HPV 16 VLPs.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Although DC and LC are able to bind and internalize HPV 16 VLPs, difference in entry kinetics was observed between both cell types with a faster entry of HPV 16 VLPs into LC compared with DC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	209	 As a correlation between entry kinetics and cell receptors has been previously shown with other viruses (Narayan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	210	, 2003), we looked for potential different types of HPV 16 VLPs binding to DC and LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The most described epithelial receptors for HPV are heparan sulfates and integrin (Evander et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Our inhibition experiments with heparin or sodium chlorate confirm that DC use heparan sulfates to bind HPV 16 VLPs in contrast to LC in agreement with the data of Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	213	 (2004) showing that HPV 6b L1 VLPs uptake by DC is inhibited in the presence of heparin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Other pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis also use heparan sulfates to enter DC (Matyszak et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	215	 (2002) suggested that heparan sulfates moiety detected on DC may also play an immunoregulatory role.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	216	 In fact, heparan sulfates and their degradation products have been reported to deliver costimulatory signals to T cells and maturation signals to DC (Wrenshall et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	217	, 1991; Kodaira  and  Platt, 2000; Johnson et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This may explain why HPV VLPs initiate DC (but not LC) maturation and activation.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	219	HPV 6b genotype has been shown to interact with epithelial cells by 6 integrin (Evander et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, this receptor is poorly expressed in DC and LC and probably not implicated in the differences of HPV 16 VLPs uptake between both cell types.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	221	 (2004) also reported that 6 integrin is not responsible for the initiation of binding of HPV 6b L1 VLPs by LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	222	LC express several receptors that facilitate antigen recognition and uptake, including Fc receptors, DEC205 multilectin and langerin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Langerin is exclusively expressed by LC (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	224	, 1999) and is localized not only on the cell surface, but also intracellularly in close association with Birbeck granules.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This molecule functions as an endocytic receptor (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Upon binding to the cell surface, anti-langerin antibodies are rapidly internalized and delivered to Birbeck granules (Valladeau et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Electron microscopy analysis showed that HPV 16 VLPs colocalize with anti-langerin antibodies.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Indeed they were detected together in coated pits and in large cytoplasmic vesicles.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These data are in agreement with recent studies showing that the processing pathway of HPV 6b L1 VLPs in LC is associated with langerin+ compartments (Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	230	, 2004) and that other viruses, such as HIV, also use langerin and lectin or mannose to enter into LC and DC, respectively (Turville et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Our electron microscopy analysis showed a colocalization of HPV 16 VLPs and langerin in large cytoplasmic vesicles resembling to endosome, which may be related to the observation that langerin is associated with the CD1a recycling compartment (McDermott et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	232	 HPV 6 VLPs were also shown to be colocalized with CD1a+ endosome (Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	233	, 2004), but the loading mechanism was not determined.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	234	 When mannan, which was shown to be able to inhibit HIV entry in LC, was used a 40 % inhibition of VLP entry was observed suggesting that other proteins are also involved in the VLP binding to LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	235	 It will be interesting to determine the direct effects of langerin in VLP binding by further experiments and if other lectins are also involved in the uptake of VLPs by LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	236	As the cell surface binding of HPV 16 VLPs differed in DC and LC, we wondered if their internalization was also different as suggested by Fausch et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	237	 (2003) showed that DC use a clathrin-mediated endocytosis whereas LC use a different pathway, which is not associated with clathrin or caveolae.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	238	 (2004) show that HPV 6 VLP enter in LC by a caveolae-dependent pathway.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Entry pathways can be inhibited at different stages by specific inhibitors, such as chlorpromazine, cytochalasin D, nystatin and filipin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	240	 When using these drugs, HPV 16 VLP entry was only inhibited in the presence of chlorpromazine and cytochalasin D whereas no inhibition was observed with the caveolae inhibitors, nystatin and filipin.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	241	 These results suggest that VLP enter in DC and LC by a clathrin-mediated pathway and are in agreement with the direct demonstration of HPV 16 VLPs in coated pits and cytoplasmic vesicles with a clathrin morphology in LC and DC preparations processed for electron microscopy.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The differences between these studies might be related to the different methods used to analyse HPV VLPs internalization although we cannot exclude different endocytosis pathways according to the origin of cells used to generate LC.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In agreement with this hypothesis, the LC used in this study poorly expressed syndecan-1 in contrast to the LC generated by Yan et al.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	244	The fact that HPV 16 VLPs use different types of cell binding to DC and LC might have important functional consequences.
0.14963757.15831940.html.plaintext.txt	245	 It has been shown that the maturation of DC and LC depends not only on receptors involved in the uptake of pathogens but also on receptors directly acting on DC activation (Niedergang et al.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received October 24, 1997; Revised and Accepted January 8, 1998.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	4	Transcriptional interference between adjacent genes has been demonstrated in a variety of biological systems.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To study this process in RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcribed genes we have analysed the effect of transcription on tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated into the genome of HeLa cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We show that transcriptional activation at the upstream promoter reduces transcription from the downstream promoter, as compared with basal transcription conditions (in the absence of an activator).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Furthermore, insertion of a strong transcriptional termination element between the two promoters alleviates this transcriptional interference, resulting in elevated levels of transcription from the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Actual protein interactions with the downstream (occluded) promoter were analysed by in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Binding of Sp1 transcription factors to the occluded promoter was reduced, when compared with the footprint pattern of the promoter protected by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This suggests that promoter occlusion is due to disruption of certain transcription factors and that it can be blocked by an intervening transcriptional terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Chromatin mapping with DNase I indicates that a factor binds to the termination element under both basal and induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	12	Termination of transcription may be defined as arrest of the elongating polymerase followed by release of the transcription complex and nascent RNA from the DNA template.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is known that in eukaryotes functional poly(A) signals are required for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II (pol II), since mutations which disrupt polyadenylation also result in the loss of termination (1-3).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Furthermore, the strength of the poly(A) signal correlates with termination efficiency, since a stronger processing signal is more effective in directing termination (4).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Actual termination sites remain ill defined and in most cases studied so far transcription continues well beyond the poly(A) site (5) until a downstream element is encountered which forces the elongating polymerase to pause or arrest (6,7).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Pause sites can take various forms, such as DNA-bound protein complexes or intrinsic DNA sequence elements, either of which are capable of causing poly(A) site-dependent termination of transcription (6,8-11).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	17	It has been reported that inefficient transcriptional termination can cause interference with DNA replication and with transcription of an adjacent, downstream gene, leading to impairment of these central cellular processes (12-16).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This emphasizes the need for an efficient termination process in some cases.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Transcriptional interference (promoter occlusion) has been observed in various eukaryotic systems, including genes transcribed by pol I and II, in prokaryotic operons and in certain viruses (12).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In vitro experiments in the pol I system have suggested a mechanism for promoter occlusion where transcription through the promoter may cause displacement of a bound transcription factor.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Interference is prevented by terminator elements which reside upstream of each pol I promoter (17,18).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In contrast to the less complex pol I promoter, transcription by pol II depends on multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the promoter and enhancer regions, which form stable initiation complexes (19).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	23	In the present work we have studied tandem pol II promoters, derived from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), stably integrated into the chromosome.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We investigated the importance of an intervening transcriptional terminator in this context and furthermore have also investigated DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Analysis of cytoplasmic RNA revealed that upon transactivation with the viral Tat protein transcription from the downstream promoter is reduced (as compared with already high basal transcriptional conditions).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A transcriptional terminator placed between the two LTR promoters allowed increased transcription from both promoters upon transactivation by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Actual DNA-protein interactions on the downstream promoter were analysed by DMS in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	28	 While we consistently observed footprints when the promoter was preceded by the terminator, these were reduced when the protective intervening terminator was absent, suggesting reduced binding of transcription factors to the occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The footprint pattern changed mainly across the binding sites for transcription factor Sp1.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, DNase I footprinting in vivo indicated binding of a protein to the 5[prime]-end of the pause site, corresponding to the position where the termination factor MAZ has been shown to bind in vitro (11).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This binding activity is stable under induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that a pol II termination element located between strong pol II promoters plays a critical role in preventing transcriptional interference in a chromosomal context.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We suggest that transcriptional interference may result in destabilization of specific transcription factors on the occluded promoter.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	36	 CII contains a termination element placed between the LTR promoters [the SpA poly(A) site followed by the C2 pause site], allowing termination of L1 transcripts upstream of the L2 promoter.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	63	 1) were transfected, one containing an intervening termination signal [SPAC, consisting of the strong poly(A) site SPA and the downstream C2 pause element] between the two LTRs (CII; 25) and the other without this intervening termination signal (CI).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Individual cell clones containing the CI and CII transgenes respectively were expanded and maintained in selective (G418-containing) medium.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Since the HIV-1 promoter is inducible by the viral transactivator Tat, we were able to detect transcriptional interference by enhancing transcription with Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This was achieved by stably transfecting these clonally derived CI and CII cells lines with a Tat-expressing vector, allowing a direct comparison of basal and Tat trans-activated transcription of one particular clone.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Tat expression was monitored at the RNA level by S1 nuclease mapping of the Tat transcript (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the experiments described below we analysed individual clones derived from these stable transfections which were checked for their integrity and copy number by Southern blotting (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Clones containing single copy integrants were employed.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Furthermore, to obtain position-independent values we also analysed complex cell pools consisiting of >100 positive clones.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Trans-activation by Tat leads to reduced transcription from the L2 promoter in CI cell lines.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The gel was quantified in a phosphorimager.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Bars represent RNA levels from the L1 and L2 promoters under basal (-Tat) and trans-activated conditions (+Tat) and were normalized to the neo control.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Also shown are values for a complex CI cell pool (note the lower scale).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The diagram at the bottom shows the origin of the protected RNA species.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The tandem promoters L1 and L2 (white boxes) driving the [alpha]2-globin reporter fragments (grey bars) and the SV40 promoter (which is driving the neo gene) are shown, as are the HIV-1 poly(A) site at +80 (relative to the start site at +1; empty triangles), the [alpha]2-globin poly(A) site (grey triangle) and the LTR-specific antisense riboprobe (L) which protects transcripts initiated at both LTR promoters simultaneously.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The intervening terminator (SPAC) allows increased transcription from L2 promoters in the presence of Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	80	 RNase protection assay of cytoplasmic RNA from HeLa cells stably transfected with CII.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Lanes 1 and 3, two different CII clones under trans-activated conditions (+Tat); lanes 2 and 4, the same clones under basal conditions (-Tat); lanes 5 and 6, undigested riboprobes L and S.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Trans-activation allows an increase in transcription from both promoters, L1 and L2, in the presence of the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Values were normalized to the internal neo standard.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Also shown are values for a complex CII cell pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Diagram as in Figure 2, except that the intervening terminator, SPAC, containing the synthetic poly(A) site is shown (filled triangle).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	86	It should be noted that the CI and CII constructs both contain an adjacent SV40 promoter-enhancer element which is used to drive expression of the neo gene.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consequently, the HIV LTR promoters are significantly active in the absence of Tat, presumably due to the proximity of the SV40 enhancer (26,27).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Even so, the presence of Tat further activated the LTR promoters and allowed detection of transcriptional interference effects between the adjacent LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	89	Transcriptional activity from the two promoters (L1 and L2) was assessed by RNase protection assays (Figs 2 and 3).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Cytoplasmic RNA, extracted from various individual clones and pools, was analysed using a mixture of two riboprobes: probe L, an LTR-specific riboprobe which recognizes both LTR transcripts simultaneously and distinguishes between L1 read-through and L2 initiating transcripts (derived as a PvuII-SmaI fragment from L2); probe S hybridizes to transcripts initiated at the SV40 promoter (which drives transcription of the neo gene contained within the transfected plasmid).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Probe S was included as an internal control in each assay which allowed direct comparison of a single clone under basal and trans-activated conditions, when normalized to the internal standard.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	92	Transcriptional interference occurs between stably integrated tandem HIV-1 LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	93	As shown in Figure 2, RNase protection analysis of transcripts derived from three CI clones yields two major products of 134 and 230 nt, corresponding to transcripts initiating on the L1 and L2 promoters respectively.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Figure 2 also shows quantitative analysis of this data as well as comparable data for a CI pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	95	 These results demonstrate a relatively small change in L1 and L2 promoter activity following trans-activation by Tat, presumably due to their already high basal levels.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Using the SV40 RNA as an internal standard (which is not responsive to Tat), a direct assessment of the change in LTR promoter activity under induced conditions was determined.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Under basal conditions (-Tat) the L2/L1 ratio was calculated as ~3 (varying from 2.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	98	5 between the three clonal and pool RNAs, taking the number of labeled residues into account).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, in the presence of Tat, while the activity of L1 increased, L2 activity actually decreased (relative to basal transcription conditions), indicating that the trans-activated upstream promoter may be reducing transcription from the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The LTR fragment comprising L2 contains an additional 20 bp from the LTR at its 3[prime]-end, which might explain the consistently higher L2 promoter activity.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	101	 As mentioned above, using these chromosomally integrated constructs transcription from the HIV-1 promoters is rather high, even in the absence of Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In contrast, transcription from the same constructs (lacking the SV40 driven neo gene) could hardly be detected without Tat in transient expression assays (20).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The most likely explanation for this difference is the presence of the SV40 regulatory region containing the enhancer (380 bp from SfiI to PvuII), which has been shown to influence expression from the HIV-1 and human globin gene promoters (28).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The proximity of this potent enhancer could affect basal transcription rates, thereby leading to the relatively muted Tat enhancement (27,28).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, since these tandem promoters are differently affected by Tat, we infer that the activated L1 promoter (+Tat) reduces transcription from the downstream L2 promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	106	Additional minor bands visible in Figure 2 derive from L1 transcripts reading into the L2 region of the construct.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In particular, the L1 transcript is polyadenylated at the downstream L2 HIV poly(A) site (HpA; Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	108	 1), giving rise to a 116 nt 3[prime] doublet.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	109	 A small fraction of transcripts read through this poly(A) site, generating bands of ~150 and 248 nt.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The 248 nt species arises from read-through of Hp(A) in L2 to the 5[prime] splice site of the [alpha]-globin reporter gene.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The origin of the 150 nt species may derive from a cryptic splice site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Both of these L1 species, as well as the major 134 nt fragment, increase upon trans-activation.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The constant band of ~200 nt does not change upon trans-activation and derives from incompletely digested riboprobe.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Overall the 3[prime]-end products of transcription initiated at the L1 promoter are clearly present at much lower levels than the 134 nt 5[prime] product using probe L.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Presumably a significant fraction of L1 transcripts is spliced out in the L2 region.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Identification of these various minor L1-derived bands was confirmed by S1 nuclease mapping (data not shown).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	117	An intervening transcriptional terminator alleviates interference and restores L2 promoter activity upon Tat transactivation.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	118	To examine the role of a strong transcriptional termination element placed between two pol II promoters in a chromosomal context, cytoplasmic RNA extracted from clones and pools stably transfected with the CII construct was analysed by RNase protection (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	119	 CII contains a strong synthetic poly(A) site (SPA) followed by the C2 transcriptional pause site (11,25,29) between the two LTR promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	120	 As mentioned above, transcriptional termination signals have previously been shown to relieve interference in transient transfection assays (30).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Since promoters may be regulated differently when part of higher order chromatin we wished to examine the role of this termination element between the LTR promoters in stable integrants.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	122	 As shown in Figure 3, no read-in transcripts were detected from the L1 promoter, suggesting 100% SPA use.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Secondly, whereas trans-activaton led to a relative decrease of L2 in CI clones, we consistently observed an increase for both promoters, L1 and L2, in CII when transcription was enhanced by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	124	 These results suggest that transcription from the downstream promoter, upon trans-activation, can only increase when preceded by the termination element.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	125	The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that interference occurs between stably integrated tandem LTR promoter constructs which was detected upon transcriptional enhancement by Tat.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Inhibition of the downstream promoter can be overcome by the presence of the intervening termination signal.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	127	In vivo footprinting indicates reduced binding of transcription factors to the occluded L2 promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	128	Promoter occlusion by the incoming polymerase complex may be caused by impeding transcription factor access to the promoter or alternatively by actual displacement of factors already bound to the promoter (17).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	129	 We therefore analysed actual DNA-protein interactions on the downstream L2 promoter by in vivo footprinting (31).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It should be noted that neither restricted access nor displacement of factors is likely to be an `all-or-nothing effect' and its resolution in vivo is therefore limited.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Footprinting was carried out using dimethylsulfate (DMS) as the modifying agent.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	132	 DMS methylates freely accessible guanosine residues of DNA in living cells, unless they are protected by DNA-bound factors.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Cells derived from both lines (CI and CII) were incubated with DMS for 5 min (qualitatively similar results were obtained with 2 and 10 min incubations), genomic DNA was purified, cleaved with piperidine and analysed by linker-mediated PCR on 6% sequencing gels.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	134	 As a control phenol-extracted chromosomal DNA was treated with DMS in vitro and analysed in parallel.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Footprinting was performed on the coding strand of various clones and pools.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The promoter region from -15 (relative to the start site at +1) to the distal NF-[kappa]B sites is shown.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The left half of the figure (CI) shows the reduced footprints across the upstream elements (indicated on the left side) of CI integrants.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Three G residues are indicated at the right side (filled arrowheads, -47, -60 and -79 relative to the start site at +1).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	141	A typical analysis is shown in Figure 4, where panel CII represents samples from a CII clone and pool.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Binding sites for transcription factor Sp1 are clearly visible as compared with the control (co, lane 7).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	143	 As expected, these sites are engaged in protein interactions on an active HIV-1 promoter (32).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In detail, the CII profiles compared with the control DNA (lane 7) indicate a partial protection of G residues in Sp1 sites 1 and 2, in particular at positions -54 and -55 with respect to the transcriptional start site, a hypersensitive site between the proximal Sp1 sites 1 and 2, at position -60, strong protections in Sp1 site 3 and a hypersensitive site at -79.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The distal Sp1 site 3 is known to have the highest affinity for Sp1 in vitro (33).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Whereas these footprints are clearly apparent in CII clones (and pools), they are significantly reduced in CI clones (and pools) lacking the intervening terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The clearest differences are seen over the distal, high affinity Sp1 site 3, where all G residues are less protected in CI integrants.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Also, the G residues at -54 and -55 are markedly less protected in the CI clones (G residues in SP1 site 1 are also slightly less protected).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	149	 A reduction in hypersensity over the NF-[kappa]B sites was also noted (mainly in CI clones), although with less consistency.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Overall these results indicate that protein interactions on the downstream promoter, especially over the Sp1 sites, in CI clones are reduced when compared with those on the corresponding promoter preceded by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	151	 We also observed minor differences in the protein interactions in CI clones when trans-activated by Tat as compared with basal conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In particular, the two NF-[kappa]B sites and position -79 evident in c1/1 and c1/2, which are less hypersensitive in the presence of Tat, indicate perturbed protein interactions under trans-activated conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	153	Taken together, the genomic footprinting data presented in Figure 4 reveal reduced binding of Sp1 (and to a lesser extent NF-[kappa]B) to the downstream promoter in the absence of an upstream terminator, indicating an effect of interference on protein interactions at the promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Since Sp1 activates transcription synergistically (34) and both proteins, Sp1 and NF-[kappa]B, are known to contact components of the basal transcription factor TFIID (35), displacement of these factors would explain reduced transcription from an occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	155	A factor binds to the C2 pause site in vivo.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	156	The C2 pause element originates from the 420 bp intergenic region of the human complement genes C2 and factor B, located in the MHC class III region.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	157	 A region of 156 bp downstream of the C2 poly(A) site, which contains a protein binding site towards its 5[prime]-end, has been implicated in pol II termination (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The zinc finger protein MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger protein), which was originally identified as a factor that binds to the c-myc P2 promoter (36), correlated with the termination efficiency of the pause sites in various assays (29).

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The diagram at the bottom shows the position of the pause site and the MAZ binding site.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	166	To see whether a protein binds to the MAZ site in our integrated construct in vivo we analysed the chromatin structure of this region by DNase I in vivo footprinting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Footprinting was carried out in isolated nuclei, which were taken up in physiological buffer (23) and partially digested with DNase I (24).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The cleavage pattern of the non-coding strand was analysed by linker-mediated PCR and compared with naked DNA, partially digested in vitro (no specific primers could be designed to analyse the coding strand).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Figure 5 shows a hypersensitive site at the 5[prime]-border of the protein binding site, slight protection in the centre (compare lane 2 and 5), a strongly protected residue towards the 3[prime]-end and a hypersensitive site at the 3[prime]-border.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The in vivo footprinting pattern is in agreement with previous in vitro footprinting data, where a 27 bp region at the same position was protected from DNase I using HeLa cell extract (29).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The data also indicated that the pattern did not change upon Tat induction (Fig.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	172	 5, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting stable binding of the protein to this site under basal and induced conditions.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The same pattern was obtained when analysing DNA from a cell pool in the presence of Tat (lane 4).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These results indicate that a protein binds to the C2 pause site in vivo and that binding is not abolished by Tat-actived transcription from upstream.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	175	 It would therefore seem likely that the binding of this factor to the terminator sequence is not disrupted by transcriptional interference.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	176	Transcriptional interference between adjacent transcription units has been observed in various systems.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Initially experiments in Escherichia coli showed that transcription from the strong prophage [lambda] promoter Pl inhibits the adjacent gal promoter (12).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Interference between promoters has also been detected on plasmids transiently transfected into mammalian cells (30).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In vitro experiments in pol I systems led to the suggestion of a possible mechanism for this phenomenon.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Template competition experiments in the mouse pol I system indicated actual displacement of transcription factor D by the incoming polymerase, which allowed transcription of competitor templates by the displaced factor (17).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A similar observation was made on the pol I promoter in the lower eukaryote Acanthamoeba, where a single initiation factor (TIF, the Acanthamoeba analogue of mouse factor D) is required for pre-initiation complex assembly and polymerase recruitment to the promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In vitro footprinting analysis revealed displacement of TIF from a dimeric pol I promoter construct by pol I passage through the promoter (18).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	183	Earlier work has emphasized a role for transcriptional termination elements to relieve interference between transcription units on plasmids transiently transfected into mammalian cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	184	 To examine the importance of terminators between transcription units in the genome we used HIV-1 LTR driven reporter constructs stably integrated into HeLa cells.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Since the HIV promoter is trans-activated by Tat we could directly compare individual clones under basal and trans-activated conditions and the effect of a trans-activated promoter on the downstream transcription unit.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	186	 As mentioned above, the high basic transcription rates of the transgenes were ascribed to the proximity of the SV40 regulatory region with its strong enhancer.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, the relative increase in transcription in the presence of Tat in this system was not drastic (27).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Nevertheless, upon trans-activation, while transcription from the upstream promoter L1 increased up to 5-fold, transcription from the downstream L2 promoter increased only when preceded by the terminator.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Mapping the 3[prime]-end of the upstream L1 transcript revealed its extension into the L2 promoter in CI (-terminator) cell lines, whereas in CII lines it was processed at the intervening terminator.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Stable cell lines transfected with an MLV expression vector containing the whole keratin 10 gene downstream of the MLV promoter followed by a hygromycin B resistance gene were selected and tested for keratin expression by western blotting.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	192	 No keratin 10 was detected in these clones unless SPAC was positioned between the MLV and keratin promoters.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Eighteen of 22 hygromycin B-resistant clones synthesized keratin 10 when SPAC was present (22).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	194	Since interference might be caused by disruption of transcription factor binding to the promoter by an upstream elongation-competent polymerase complex, we mapped DNA-protein interactions on the L2 promoter in vivo.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Comparison of occluded versus protected L2 promoter by DMS in vivo footprinting revealed reduced footprints at the occluded promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Differences in the protein binding pattern in CI and CII were mainly evident across the three Sp1 binding sites and to a lesser degree at the tandem NF-[kappa]B binding sites.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Reduction in Sp1 binding was consistent in several experiments and ~3-fold, whereas changes at the NF-[kappa]B sites varied.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Since Sp1 activates transcription synergistically (34) and partly by interacting with TAF 110, a component of the basal transcription factor TFIID (37), loss of Sp1 would be expected to result in a reduction in transcriptional activity.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Interestingly, Sp1 sites were shown to have no effect on transcriptional termination (10), whereas a bound CAAT box binding protein was effective in termination.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	200	 It seems possible that, depending on the nature of the DNA-protein interaction, binding of some factors is disrupted by transcription, whereas others remain stably bound.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The ability of DNA-bound proteins to impede polymerase elongation has previously been demonstrated (38).
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	202	DNase I in vivo footprinting across the C2 pause site of the terminator indicated binding of a factor to the 5[prime]-part of the of the pause element.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This binding pattern did not change after Tat trans-activation, suggesting a stable contact despite increased transcription from upstream.

0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In CII the polymerase is stalled at the terminator, possibly by MAZ (black oval) bound to the pause site of the terminator, allowing stable binding of Sp1 to the downstream promoter.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	212	Our data suggest that transcriptional termination elements play an important role in regulation of gene expression, to allow individual expression of adjacent transcription units.
0.15876892.9469840.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The absence of a terminator can lead to reduction or impairment of adjacent gene expression, probably resulting from a disruption of DNA-bound regulatory proteins by a processive polymerase complex.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	7	 At least three viral membrane proteins (gE, gI, and Us9) are necessary for the spread of infection from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons (anterograde spread) in infected rodents.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To understand how these proteins effect anterograde spread between neurons, we analyzed the subcellular localization of viral proteins after infection of cultured rat sympathetic neurons with wild-type or mutant viruses.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	9	 After Us9-null mutant infections but not gE-null mutant infections, only a subset of the viral structural proteins had entered axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Surprisingly, capsid and tegument proteins but not viral membrane proteins were detected in axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The spread of Us9 missense mutants in the rodent nervous system correlated with the amount of viral membrane proteins localized to axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We conclude that the Us9 membrane protein controls axonal localization of diverse viral membrane proteins but not that of capsid or tegument proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The data support a model where virion subassemblies but not complete virions are transported in the axon.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	16	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   -Herpesviruses are unique parasites of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS)*.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	17	 After primary infection at an epithelial surface, virus invades the termini of sensory and autonomic neurons innervating the infected tissue.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Subsequently, virion components are transported through axons to the cell bodies of these neurons, usually a substantial distance from the termini.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Movement of virion components from the axon terminal to the cell body is thought to occur via microtubule-based motors such as dynein moving material in a plus-to-minus direction (Enquist et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Within a week of invading the cell bodies of PNS ganglionic neurons, production of infectious virus ceases, and a quiescent or latent state is established.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Months or years later, the latent infection can be reactivated, and new virions are produced in PNS ganglionic neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The virions then travel via axons to the periphery and infect the epithelia, producing infectious virus that can spread to other hosts.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Long distance movement of newly replicated virions from the cell body to distant axon terminals is not well understood but has been suggested to occur using microtubule-based motors such as the kinesins that move cargo in the minus-to-plus direction (Enquist et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	24	, 1998; Sodeik, 2000; Smith et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The movement of virions in PNS axons toward the cell body after primary infection or away from the neuronal cell body via PNS axons after replication implies that -herpesviruses may encode gene products capable of regulating directional axonal transport.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	26	Evidence of viral proteins capable of affecting direction of virus movement in living animals came from studies of circuit-specific transneuronal infection by pseudorabies virus (PRV; a broad host range -herpesvirus).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The proteins gE, gI, and Us9 are all universally conserved in known neurotropic -herpesvirus genomes.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	28	 gE and gI are type I transmembrane proteins that typically form a heterodimer, whereas Us9 is a type II tail-anchored membrane protein.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Several groups discovered that -herpesvirus gE, gI, or Us9 mutants were able to replicate in primary neurons but were incapable of spreading to secondary postsynaptic neurons (Card et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, after infection of the rat eye wild-type PRV replicates in retinal neurons and spreads via the optic nerve to secondary neurons in all visual nuclei in the central nervous system (for review see Enquist et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	31	 By contrast, gE, gI, or Us9-null mutants replicate well in retinal neurons but do not spread to second-order neurons in the superior colliculus in the midbrain (Whealy et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This defect is significant, since >90% of the retinal ganglion cells in the rat retina are in synaptic contact with neurons in the superior colliculus (Linden and Perry, 1983).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Similar defects in the spread of gE and gI mutant viruses from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons (often called anterograde spread) have also been reported after nasal infection of swine (the natural host of PRV) (Kritas et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Although PRV gE, gI, and Us9 proteins are required for efficient spread from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons through most neural circuits tested, these three proteins are not required for spread from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons (often called retrograde spread) (Whealy et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	35	All available evidence suggests that the defect in anterograde transsynaptic spread exhibited by gE, gI, and Us9 mutants occurs within the primary presynaptic infected neuron (Husak et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	36	 One hypothesis is that in gE, gI, or Us9 mutant infections virions assembled in the cell body fail to be transported into axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	37	 An alternative suggestion is that in mutant infections assembled virions enter axons but can not be released from axon terminals.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In this report, we tested these hypotheses by examining the localization of virion structural proteins after wild-type or mutant infection of cultured neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	39	 If the first hypothesis is true, virion structural proteins should not be found in axons after mutant infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	40	 If the second hypothesis is true, structural proteins should be found in axons for both mutant and wild-type infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Our work revealed that neither hypothesis is correct and suggested a unique function for the Us9 protein.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Although the presence or absence of gE had no obvious effect on localization of virion structural proteins to axons of infected neurons, after Us9-null mutant infections only a subset of the viral structural proteins had entered axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Surprisingly, capsid and tegument proteins but not viral membrane proteins were detected in axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	44	We have previously used alanine substitution mutagenesis to define Us9 residues essential for in vivo anterograde spread of PRV in the rat visual system (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This work indicated that two adjacent tyrosines (Y49Y50) in an acidic motif (residues 46 to 56) were absolutely essential for Us9 function (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In addition, we found that two serines (S51S53) in the acidic domain were phosphorylated, and alanine substitutions of these residues affected the rate of Us9-dependent in vivo anterograde spread.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Finally, alanine substitution mutagenesis of two adjacent leucine residues (L30L31) that function as an endocytosis motif (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	48	, 2000b) are dispensable for anterograde spread in vivo.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We infected cultured PNS neurons with these mutant viruses to determine if the Us9-dependent localization of viral membrane proteins correlated with their ability to promote anterograde spread of infection in vivo.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We found that tyrosines 48 and 50 but not serines 51 and 53 were absolutely required for Us9-mediated membrane protein localization in axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Leucines 30 and 31 were completely dispensable for the axonal localization of viral membrane proteins just as they are for anterograde spread in vivo.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	58	 We suggest that a single viral protein (Us9) is responsible for the localization of most if not all viral membrane proteins to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	59	 If membrane proteins are not localized to axons and transported to axon terminals, viral infection cannot spread to synaptically connected neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	60	 An important finding was that Us9 is not required for localization of the capsid or tegument proteins to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	61	 An interpretation of our observations is that mature virions are not assembled in the cell body and subsequently transported in axons to the axon terminal.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Rather, components of mature virions are transported separately in axons to terminals where infection of postsynaptic cells occurs.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Accordingly, we determined the localization of viral structural components in neurons infected with wild-type or mutant viruses.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Initially, we examined the subcellular distribution of the viral glycoprotein gB in neurons that were infected with wild-type, gE-null, and Us9-null viruses.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	66	 gB is an abundant viral membrane protein that is required for virus entry and cell-to-cell spread in all cells (Rauh and Mettenleiter, 1991).

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	69	 At 16 h after infection, gB puncta could be found throughout the extent of axons of neurons infected with either virus (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	70	 However, in Us9-null infections very little gB could be detected in the axons of infected neurons even at the latest times after infection (Fig.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	72	 These experiments provided the first direct evidence that Us9 and gE may have different functions in infected neurons leading to transsynaptic spread.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The results were similar to those for gB described above: the amount of gC and gE and the distance the membrane proteins had traveled in the axon were dramatically reduced during Us9-null mutant infections compared with wild-type infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thus, three diverse virion membrane proteins (gB, gC, and gE) required Us9 protein to localize to and fill axons, even though no obvious defect in the expression or localization of these glycoproteins within the cell body was apparent by confocal microscopy.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	226	 During reactivation, the virus travels back to the periphery most likely in the same neuron that had been infected some time before.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Movement of virion components to and from the cell body of PNS neurons requires that viral proteins enter axons and move substantial distances (Tomishima et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Because access to the axon is restricted to a subset of neuronal proteins, typically those involved in synapse formation and function, it is likely that -herpesviruses have evolved mechanisms to interact with the axonal targeting and transport machinery to ensure the transport of viral proteins into axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	229	 We have demonstrated previously that Us9 is involved in spread of virus from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Here, we provide a simple explanation of this phenotype and demonstrate that Us9 is required for the localization of most if not all viral membrane proteins to the axon of infected neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	231	We were surprised to find that Us9 was not required to localize nonmembrane structural components of the virion (for example, capsid and tegument proteins) to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	232	 This finding has important implications for herpesvirus assembly and addresses a long-standing problem of how and where the large and complex herpes virion is assembled in infected PNS neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	233	 A widely held idea is that completely assembled virions accumulate in the cell body and these nascent enveloped virions are transported in vesicles out of the cell body into axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Then, by microtubule-based motors the vesicles carry the enveloped virions to the axon terminals where they exit to infect the postsynaptic cell (Lycke et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In another model first suggested by Penfold et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	236	 (1994) for herpes simplex virus type 1, complete virions are not assembled in the cell body but rather are assembled at or near the axon terminal.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These workers observed capsids in axons separate from envelope proteins and never observed fully assembled enveloped virions in axons of cultured human PNS neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	238	 (1994) proposed that capsids destined for axon terminals were not enveloped in the cell body but rather acquired their envelope at or near the axon terminal such that mature enveloped virions are released into the cleft between neuron and epithelial cell.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Our data are consistent with this proposal.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Moreover, we extend this model and suggest that Us9 protein is required for axonal localization of virion envelope subassemblies but not tegument or capsid proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	241	We and others have found that the -herpesvirus genes gE, gI, and Us9 are necessary for the anterograde spread of infection in vivo (Card et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	242	 One limitation of these in vivo experiments is the technical difficulty of examining the cell biology of the infection.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	243	 These previous experiments have only looked at the replication of virus within first- or second-order neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Consequently, it was not possible to determine why the second-order neurons were not infected.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Here, we report that Us9 is responsible for localizing viral membrane proteins to the axons of infected neurons, yet the gE and gI proteins are not needed for this function.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	246	 One idea is that gE and gI accumulate at nerve terminals to promote the spread of infection from pre- to postsynaptic neurons (Dingwell et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	247	, 2000a; Tirabassi and Enquist, 2000).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	248	The mechanism by which Us9 enables viral envelope proteins to enter axons is under study.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	249	 We tested three ideas initially.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	250	 First, does Us9 "open" the axon to any membrane protein, or does it discriminate among host and viral proteins? To test this idea, we determined the localization of well-known somatodendritic and axonal marker proteins during infection and found that even late in the infection (for example, 20 h) all marker proteins remained in their proper compartments (unpublished data).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Second, in the absence of Us9 are all membrane proteins, including host membrane proteins, blocked from entering axons in infected cells? We performed two sets of experiments to address this question.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The first experiments examined the steady-state localization of a synaptic vesicle protein in uninfected cultures and during wild-type or Us9-null mutant infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	253	 No difference could be found between the uninfected and the wild-type or Us9-null infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	254	 We also demonstrated that an axonal protein (NgCAM) translated during PRV infection was capable of trafficking into axons infected with either the wild-type or the Us9-null virus.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Finally, we tested the idea that viral membrane proteins were unable to progress through the secretory system in Us9-null infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We found that gE reaches the cell surface during Us9-null infections with kinetics that are similar (if not identical) to wild-type infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Together, these data argue that the secretory pathway is functional in Us9-null infections, and the trafficking of cellular proteins into the axon is normal in Us9-null infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It appears that Us9 specifically promotes the axonal delivery of viral membrane proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	259	 (2000b) identified L30L31 and an acidic domain (amino acids 46 to 56) as important residues for retrieval and TGN localization of Us9 from the plasma membrane in nonneuronal cells.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In addition, these authors found that amino acids Y49Y50 in the acidic motif were essential for Us9 to promote transneuronal spread of infection.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	261	 By contrast, the phosphorylated S51S53 residues affected rate of viral spread, whereas the dileucine motif had no role in viral spread in the rat visual system (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Experiments in this report extend our understanding of these phenotypes.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Infection by PRV172 (Y49Y50 to AA), which has a Us9-null phenotype in vivo, also had a null phenotype after infection of cultured neurons: all viral membrane proteins tested were markedly reduced in axons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	264	 PRV173, an Us9 alanine substitution mutant with a partial loss-of-function phenotype in anterograde spread in animals also had an intermediate phenotype in cultured neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Finally, PRV166, which has no phenotype in vivo, is indistinguishable from wild-type infection of cultured neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We can now surmise for the first time why Us9-null mutants are defective in directional transneuronal spread: membrane proteins such as gB that are absolutely required for transneuronal spread (Babic et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	267	, 1993) do not enter axons in the absence of Us9.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	268	How does Us9 promote localization of viral membrane proteins to axons? Us9 has no obvious homology to any protein or nucleic acid sequences in GenBank that might provide insight into how it functions.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	269	 However, the motifs identified by alanine substitution mutations discussed above suggest that Us9 may participate in recruiting cytoplasmic coat proteins, allowing the formation of vesicles destined for different subcellular locations (for review see Kirchhausen et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	270	, 1997; Schmid, 1997; Lewin and Mellman, 1998).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The deletion of a 10 amino acid highly conserved acidic motif (residues 46 to 56) region of Us9 blocks retrieval of Us9 from the plasma membrane to a compartment in or near the TGN, implicating this region in the recruitment of the adaptor protein AP-2 necessary for clathrin-dependent endocytosis.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This deletion mutation also removes two serines that are likely to be phosphorylated (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The cell adhesion molecule L1, the endoprotease furin, the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, and many other viral proteins have a YXX motif near an acidic cluster that contains serine residues capable of being phosphorylated by casein kinase I and II.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The trafficking of these proteins is regulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation and the tyrosine-based sorting signal (Trowbridge et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	275	The Y49Y50 motif and acidic domain are conserved throughout the known Us9 homologues in all -herpesviruses (Brideau et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	276	 This YY motif is different from the YXX motif that classically has been shown to mediate interactions with adaptor proteins (Bonifacino and Dell'Angelica, 1999).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Nevertheless, given the phenotypes of the YY to AA mutants we suggest that the two tyrosines critical for Us9 function interact with particular cytoplasmic adaptor proteins necessary for the movement of vesicles between compartments of the cell.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	278	 There is a precedent for herpesviruses usurping adaptor-mediated targeting during infection: the PRV membrane protein gE has been shown to direct vesicles containing virions to the basolateral domain of polarized epithelial cells, and this sorting is dependent on the adaptor complex AP-1 (Johnson et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	279	 10) where viral membrane proteins achieve a steady-state localization in the trans-Golgi network or a post-Golgi compartment in the cell body.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Once in this compartment, viral membrane proteins are selectively incorporated into vesicles destined for the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In the simplest case, the presence of Us9 in the compartment recruits a neuron-specific adaptor complex that binds to Us9 via the dityrosine motif (for example, some forms of AP-3 are possible candidates) (Pevsner et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	282	, 1994), leading to the formation of transport vesicles carrying Us9 and other viral membrane proteins "coated" with the axonal adaptors.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Therefore, in the absence of Us9 vesicles, containing viral membrane proteins would not be directed to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	284	 The cytoplasmic tails of other viral membrane proteins could still bind to other adaptor complexes, allowing vesiculation and transport to the cell surface or movement to compartments other than the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In this model, only one molecule in a transport vesicle need carry the cis-acting axonal sorting signal.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Such a "piggyback" model of axonal targeting of neuronal proteins has been proposed recently (Roos and Kelly, 2000).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Other proteins within the vesicle gain access to the axon simply by being in the same vesicle as the protein with the sorting signal.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	288	 We propose that Us9 represents such an axon-specific sorting molecule and that other viral membrane proteins are merely "cargo.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	289	" However, our observation that not all of the vesicles within the axon contain Us9 is noteworthy.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Perhaps only vesicles moving into the axon contain Us9, whereas the non-Us9 to containing vesicles enriched in the distal axon represent viral membrane proteins that have accumulated within an organelle (for example, an endosome).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Alternatively, Us9 may function in the cell body of the neuron to alter the trafficking patterns of viral membrane proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	292	 We are in the process of testing these ideas.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	297	 (A) The targeting of viral membrane proteins to the axon requires Us9.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	298	 A tyrosine-based cytoplasmic sorting signal in Us9 interacts with AP-3, allowing the formation of axonal transport vesicles coated with this adaptor complex.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Other viral membrane proteins are passive "cargo" that are targeted to the axon due to an association with Us9, not a cis-acting peptide sequence.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The cytoplasmic tails of other viral membrane proteins can still interact with other adaptor complexes in wild-type infections, allowing transport vesicles to traffic to other regions of the neuron in addition to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	301	 (B) Without Us9, no axonal-sorting signal is present on the cytoplasmic tails of viral membrane proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Vesicles still form but are no longer targeted to the axon.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The cytoplasmic tails of other viral membrane proteins still interact with other adaptor complexes, allowing transport vesicles to traffic to other regions of the neuron.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	304	  In summary, we find that virion assembly is intimately associated with directional spread of infection between neurons.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	305	 It had been assumed that complete virus particles were assembled in the cell body and then moved into axons for long distance travel to axon terminals.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Our results support an alternative model proposed by Penfold et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	307	 (1994), whereby structural components of the virus are moved separately into the axons of infected neurons for later assembly.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Our genetic data indicate that the loss of a single gene, Us9, leads to a wholesale change in the subcellular localization in PNS neurons of all viral membrane proteins examined yet does not change the localization of capsid and tegument proteins.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Since viruses must subvert host processes during their replication, understanding how Us9 changes the polarity of viral membrane proteins during infection should reveal conserved neuronal proteins involved in axonal targeting and transport and may provide insight into the general mechanism of directional axonal transport.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Cell biologists have long relied on selected viral proteins to facilitate an understanding of intracellular trafficking and polarized protein delivery.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	311	 -Herpesviruses have evolved mechanisms to parasitize and coexist with neurons of a broad range of hosts, and they may offer new tools to probe the cellular and molecular mechanisms of polarized protein traffic in neurons.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	348	Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy Neurons were cultured in 35-mm plastic dishes for 3 wk as described above.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	349	 At this time, the axonal network was extensive.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Two concentrations of virus inoculum were used: a low multiplicity of infection such that 10% of the cells were infected and a high multiplicity of infection such that almost all neurons were infected.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	351	 We found that the majority of the input virions bound directly to the tissue culture dish and never came into contact with the cultured neurons (unpublished data).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Therefore, precise calculations of the multiplicity of infection are difficult.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	353	 After 1 h, the inoculum was removed by aspiration and replaced with the original culture medium that had been incubated at 37 degrees C.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	354	 At various times after infection, neurons were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	355	2% paraformaldehyde, and then rinsed three times with PBS.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The neurons were permeabilized for 3 min in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	357	 In all subsequent manipulations, PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	358	5% saponin is included in the solutions.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Fixed cells were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 degrees C.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	360	 The dishes were rinsed three times with PBS/BSA/saponin and incubated with Alexa 488 to  or Alexa 568 to conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h in a humidified chamber at 37 degrees C.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Finally, the dishes were rinsed three times with PBS/BSA/saponin and once with distilled water.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	362	 A drop of Vectashield mounting medium (H 1000; Vector Laboratories) was placed in the floor of the dish, and then a coverslip was placed on the Vectashield and sealed with nail polish.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	363	Experiments examining the cell surface localization of proteins were performed as follows: after infection, antibodies were diluted in a small volume of neuron culture medium (600  microl per 35-mm dish), and this was placed on the infected neurons for 5 min at 37 degrees C, and then the neurons were rinsed once with PBS and fixed for 10 min in 3.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	364	 After fixation, the neurons were rinsed with PBS three times and were incubated in 3% BSA in PBS overnight.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA in PBS and were incubated with the fixed neurons for 1 h.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Finally, the neurons were processed as described above.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	367	Low multiplicity infections were useful as the large number of uninfected neurons provided internal controls for nonspecific antibody binding.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Low multiplicity infections also enabled us to locate and follow the long axons from single infected cell bodies.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	369	 High multiplicity infections confirmed that phenotypes were uniform throughout all neurons in the culture.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Unless otherwise indicated, all times after infection are based on low multiplicity infections.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	371	Single optical sections were captured using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad Laboratories MRC600 scan head.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	373	Determining polarity of cultured neurons: targeting and retention of control cytoskeletal components to cell bodies and axons Many types of neurons can not sort their proteins to axonal or dendritic compartments until at least 2 wk of growth in vitro (Caceres et al.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Rat sympathetic neurons derived from the SCG are reported to sort endogenous proteins to axonal and somatodendritic compartments after 3 wk in vitro (Bruckenstein and Higgins, 1988).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	375	 The polarity of cultured neurons used in this report was determined by analysis of three control proteins: (a) the axonal markers tau-1 (Boehringer) and SMI-31 (Sternberger-Meyer Immunochemicals), and (b) the cell body/dendrite markers MAP2 (Boehringer) and SMI-32 (Sternberger-Meyer Immunochemicals).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	376	 The antibody SMI-31 recognizes the phosphoforms of the M and H neurofilament, whereas the antibody SMI-32 reacts with the nonphosphoforms of the M and H neurofilament (Sternberger and Sternberger, 1983).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Since neuronal cell bodies are raised as much as 20  microm from the floor of the tissue culture dish where the axons grow, two different image planes are shown in Fig.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	385	 After fixing and permeabilizing, the neurons were labeled with antibodies that recognized the axonal markers tau-1 (D and H) and phospho-M and H neurofilament (E and I) or the somatodendritic markers MAP2 (F and J) and nonphospho-M and H neurofilament (G and K).
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Two confocal images of each field are shown: D to G have image planes at the level of the cell bodies, whereas H to K show the same neuron at the level of the substratum so that axons can be visualized.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	387	  The axonal marker tau-1 was found in nearly all neurites examined in the cultures.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Faint immunoreactivity was found within cell bodies of neurons (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	389	 11 D), but most of the staining was confined to the neurites (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Similar neurite localization was seen with the second axonal marker, SMI-31 (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	391	 The cell body/dendrite marker MAP2 (Fig.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	392	 11, F and J) localized mainly to the cell body.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Some immunoreactivity was also found in a proximal-to-distal gradient within the neurites with the strongest immunoreactivity in the proximal axon.

0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	395	 However, the extent of proximal axon staining with SMI-32 was not as pronounced as the MAP2 staining pattern.
0.16384977.11502759.html.plaintext.txt	396	 These data are consistent with previously published studies on the polarity of this culture system (Peng et al.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	4	    ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The binding sites for xanthophylls in the CP29 antenna protein of higher plant Photosystem II have been investigated using recombinant proteins refolded in vitro.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Despite the presence of three xanthophyll species CP29 binds two carotenoids per polypeptide.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The localization of neoxanthin was studied producing a chimeric protein constructed by swapping the C-helix domain from CP29 to LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The resulting holoprotein did not bind neoxanthin, confirming that the N1 site is not present in CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Neoxanthin in CP29 was, instead, bound to the L2 site, which is thus shown to have a wider specificity with respect to the homologous site L2 in LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Lutein was found in the L1 site of CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	10	 For each site the selectivity for individual xanthophyll species was studied as well as its role in protein stabilization, energy transfer, and photoprotection.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Putative xanthophyll binding sequences, identified by primary structure analysis as a stretch of hydrophobic residues including an acidic term, were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis or, in one case, by deleting the entire sequence.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The mutant proteins were unaffected in their xanthophyll composition, thus suggesting that the target motifs had little influence in determining xanthophyll binding, whereas hydrophobic sequences in the membrane-spanning helices are important.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The photoprotection function of xanthophylls is accomplished through multiple mechanisms including the quenching of Chl a triplet states, scavenging of singlet oxygen produced by the reaction of Chl triplets with O2, and participation to non-photochemical quenching, a mechanism in which violaxanthin is de-epoxidated to zeaxanthin and excess energy is dissipated into heat (7).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, xanthophylls are essential for Lhc protein folding (8), whereas their binding to a specific allosteric site controls the transition between dissipative and conservative protein conformations (9, 10).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	18	The reason why Lhc proteins require a number of xanthophyll species while reaction center proteins only require -carotene is not completely understood; these carotenoid species have very similar physico-chemical properties, enabling, in each case, efficient light harvesting, triplet quenching, and singlet oxygen scavenging (11).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Nonetheless, the pigment composition is one of the most conserved traits in higher plants, suggesting a specific function for each carotenoid species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The best known xanthophyll binding protein is the major light harvesting complex of Photosystem II (LHCII) for which four distinct binding sites have been reported to be bound into distinct domains of the protein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Sites L1 and L2 intersect the helix A/helix B cross-domain in the center of the Lhc structure (12).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	22	 L1 is selective for lutein, whereas L2 can also bind violaxanthin (13).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Site N1 is highly selective for neoxanthin and is located within the C helix domain of LHCII (14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Finally, a low affinity binding site has been named V1 after its major ligand (violaxanthin) in low light conditions (15, 16).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Each binding site was shown to play a distinct functional role; structure stabilization and Chl a triplet quenching are provided by lutein in site L1 only (10, 17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Site V1 is not involved in singlet nor in triplet energy transfer and was suggested to accommodate a pool of readily available substrate molecules for the violaxanthin deepoxydase enzyme (16), whose product, zeaxanthin, can then be bound to the allosteric site L2 (18).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Site N1 is active in light harvesting and singlet oxygen scavenging (13) and stabilizes the long lifetime conformation of LHCII (19).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	28	Despite the high homology in the transmembrane regions, which suggests a similar folding, the number of xanthophyll binding sites, their selectivity, and their occupancy in the structure seem to be different in each Lhc gene product.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Considering the different roles of individual sites and the complexity of the Lhc multigene protein family, it is possible that the function of individual Lhc gene products is largely determined by the presence/absence of individual xanthophyll sites and by their selectivity and strength.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	30	Primary sequence analysis of structural determinants for xanthophyll binding sites has been less successful than in the case of Chl binding sites, possibly due to the contribution of neighbor Chls rather than of amino acid side chains, to the formation of binding pocket for xanthophylls (13, 14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Nevertheless, four short sequences, located in the hydrophilic domains and consisting into four hydrophobic amino acids and a charged residue, could be involved in the binding by forming a hydrophobic pocket hosting xanthophylls end-rings, whereas the charged side chain was supposed to interact with oxygenated ring substituents (20).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Alternatively, binding might be performed by interactions between hydrophobic residues with the polyene chain located deeply in the membrane as observed in the bacterial LH2 complex (21).

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	152	 We have used LD to determine the orientation of xanthophyll transition moments, lying within a few degrees from the plane of the polyene chain (33) in CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	153	 To distinguish between the contribution of xanthophylls in sites L1 and L2 to the LD signal, we have used the CP29 mutants E166V and E174V previously shown to have either complete or partial emptiness of site L2 (17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The major contribution of xanthophylls to the CP29-WT LD spectrum (Fig.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	155	 6) appears as a positive signal at 495 nm, whose amplitude is reduced in the E174V mutant and becomes negative in the E166V mutant.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This suggests that the xanthophyll bound to the site L1 has its dipole moment transition forming an angle smaller than 54.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	157	7 degrees  with the normal to the membrane plane.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	160	The decreased intensity of the positive signal in CP29-E174V complex confirms that the positive contribution is related to carotenoid in the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In this case, the angle between the dipole moment transition axis and the normal to the membrane plane is larger than 54.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Using an internal standard it is possible to determine the exact values for these angles.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In CP29 the orientation of the Chls has been determined from the LD signal after normalization.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We therefore analyzed the spectra previously presented in Simonetto et al.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	165	 (26), and we calculated the orientation of the Cars transition moments.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The orientation of the xanthophyll located in the L1 site was calculated from the spectrum of the E166V mutant in which the only xanthophyll present is located in site L1.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The analysis of L2 was performed on the WT - E166V difference spectrum.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The spectra were fitted with the absorption spectra of the Cars to calculate the carotenoid LD signal as reported in Croce et al.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Then, using the factor of normalization value obtained from the analysis of the Chls transition moments (26), the values for L1 and L2 were calculated.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	170	 These values are, respectively, 50 and 70 degrees .
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	171	L1 and L2 Putative Binding Sequences By primary structure analysis within the Lhc family, four consensus sequences have been identified in the hydrophilic domains adjacent to trans-membrane-helix regions A and B, two on the stromal loops and two on the lumenal loops, which could be involved in xanthophyll binding (20) (Fig.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	172	 These sequences are characterized by an hydrophobic stretch of four residues with a polar residue insertion, thus allowing the formation of a hydrophobic pocket for hosting end-rings of xanthophylls, whereas the interaction of the polar residue with the oxygenated ring substituents could have a stabilizing effect (20).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	173	 To check the involvement of these consensus sequences in xanthophyll binding, mutation analysis was performed.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In three cases the charged amino acids in the center of the hydrophobic sequence were either substituted by a non-charged one or by a residue with an opposite charge; in one case the putative binding sequence was deleted together with the whole N-terminal domain.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In the case of the putative lumenal ligand for the carotenoid in L1 site, the mutation at the central AA (Gln-230, ligand for Chl A3) (17) has previously been performed with no effect on xanthophyll binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Close inspection of the LHCII structure (Kuhlbrandt et al.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	177	 (12)) indicates that the end ring of the xanthophyll in the L2 site appears to be closely spaced with respect to the carbonyl of proline 238.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	178	 This residue could then interact with -OH xanthophyll ring substituents.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This residue was mutated to arginine.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The only exception was the CP29-P238R mutant, which has a denaturation temperature of 57  degrees C (see "Discussion").

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The differences in the pigment binding in the mutants with respect to the WT are rather small; CP29-D50L and CP29-N-term showed Chl a/b and Chl/carotenoid ratios identical to the CP29-WT reconstituted in the same conditions, whereas a small decrease in neoxanthin and violaxanthin was compensated by an increase in lutein content.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	197	 CP29-D138L was identical to the WT.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	198	 CP29-D195L and CP29-P238R complexes showed a lower Chl a/b ratio than CP29-WT, especially in the case of the P238R mutant, but not variation in the carotenoid composition, suggesting that these changes were due to the loss of a Chl binding site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These data clearly indicate that protein motifs including the mutations here performed do not play a major role in xanthophyll binding.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	201	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   CP29 is the simplest chlorophyll-binding protein of the Lhc superfamily since it binds eight Chls per polypeptide (29), each coordinated by a specific amino acid residue (17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The binding of xanthophylls to CP29, however, is still a matter of discussion.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Consensus results have been obtained on the binding of three xanthophyll species, violaxanthin, lutein, and neoxanthin (34), but different hypotheses have been proposed for the location of each species to a particular binding site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Although there is consensus on the binding of lutein to site L1, violaxanthin and neoxanthin have either been proposed to bind to different sites, as in LHCII (15), or to compete for site L2 only, thus implying that site N1 is absent or empty in CP29 (17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	205	In this work we performed an extensive analysis of xanthophyll binding in CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In particular, we address four questions, (i) how many carotenoids are tightly bound to this complex, (ii) in which sites they are located, (iii) which is the role of individual sites and individual xanthophylls, and (iv) how the putative binding sequences can influence the binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We approached the problem by using recombinant pigment-protein complexes in which either the carotenoid complement was biochemically modified or the apoprotein was engineered at the putative carotenoid binding sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	208	How Many Carotenoids Are Bound to CP29? The data presented clearly indicate that both native and recombinant CP29 tightly bind two carotenoids per polypeptide.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	209	 One mole of lutein and substoichiometric amounts of neoxanthin and violaxanthin together summing up to one per polypeptide were found in all preparations, thus suggesting low selectivity of at least one of the binding sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	210	 This is also supported by the analysis of CP29 purified from different plant sources, showing variations in the ratio between the xanthophylls (5, 35, 36).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	211	Reconstitution experiments in the presence of either one xanthophyll species or a combination of two xanthophyll species indicate that lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin can enter both binding sites, although with different affinity and binding strength.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The neoxanthin, instead, can be accommodated in only one of the two sites, and its inability to drive the folding process alone testifies that the occupancy of this site is not sufficient to stabilize the pigment-protein complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	213	Which Binding Sites Are Present in CP29? Four xanthophyll binding sites have been described in LHCII; that is, three tightly bound, L1, L2, and N1, and a loose one (V1).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	214	 In CP29 only two of the three tight sites are conserved.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Previous results show that the L1 site is present in CP29, where it accommodates mainly lutein (17).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The second carotenoid binding site present in CP29 shows high affinity for neoxanthin, but it does not participate to the protein stability, and it can be either the L2 or N1 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	217	 To discriminate between these two sites, we constructed a chimeric LHCII CP29 protein in which the two central helices (A and B) derive from LHCII, whereas the C helix domain, previously shown to host the N1 binding site, derives from CP29 (Fig.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	218	 7B a schematic representation of the complex is presented.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The chimeric complex was stable and had spectral and pigment binding properties intermediate between CP29 and LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, no neoxanthin was found in the complex despite high amounts of this carotenoid used during the reconstitution.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	221	 We conclude that the N1 site is not present in CP29 and that the second carotenoid binding site in this complex is homologous to the L2 site of LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	222	The LD analysis indicates that the dipole moment transition axis of L1 and L2 forms, respectively, an angle of 50 and 70 degrees  with the normal to the membrane plane.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Although it is not possible from these data to determine the exact orientation of the polyene chain, it seems quite clear that the xanthophylls are oriented differently compared with LHCII, where a perfect symmetry was observed.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Although models of CP29 structure have been proposed based on LHCII, the only available Lhc structure (12), it appears that Lhc proteins may carry significant structural differences.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	225	 New structural data are of critical interest for the further understanding of Lhc protein structure and function.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	226	Stability The results presented indicate that neoxanthin can enter only the L2 site, whereas all other Cars can be accommodated in both sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This implies that when a complex contains one molecule of neoxanthin and one molecule of another xanthophyll, the latter has to be located on site L1.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This allows studying the role played by individual xanthophylls in the two sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	229	We applied this model to the stability measurements to determine the influence of different xanthophylls in the L1 and L2 sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	230	 We considered the denaturation temperature of CP29-L, CP29-V, CP29-NV, CP29-NL, and CP29-VL, and we resolved a system of five equations with five variables.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This calculation does not take into account the contribution of Chls to the stability since the Chl content of all the samples was identical.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	232	The calculation yields a value of 50.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	233	3  degrees C for the contribution of lutein in site L1 to the stability of the protein, whereas the same xanthophyll contributed only for 3.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	234	2  degrees C when located in site L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	235	 For violaxanthin the corresponding values were respectively 42.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	236	2  degrees C (for L2), whereas neoxanthin in site L2 contributes for 14.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	237	 As an example, we can calculate the stability of CP29-control (62.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	238	33  degrees C) and verify that it matches with the measured denaturation temperature (64  degrees C) of the CP29-control complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The good match indicates the independence of all variables (e.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	240	 lutein in L1 site stabilizes the complex in the same way independently from which xanthophyll is present in site L2).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The results confirm that site L1 is the most important in Lhc protein stabilization, as previously assessed in Lhcb1 (10), and lutein in this site seems to confer the highest stability to the complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Lutein in the L2 site has almost no effect on the stability, whereas the occupancy of this site by violaxanthin or, even better, by neoxanthin increases the temperature of denaturation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	243	Energy Transfer The excitation energy transfer efficiency from individual binding sites has been determined by analyzing the absorption and excitation spectra in terms of the spectral contribution of individual pigments.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The possibility of comparing samples, which differ only for the carotenoid composition, allowed quantitative information to be obtained from this analysis.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	245	 It is worth mentioning that all samples were fully equilibrated with the only partial exception of CP29-Za and CP29-Zb, which showed a small emission contribution from Chl b fluorescence at 660 nm when the complex was excited at 475 nm.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	246	Again, we applied the model used for the stability analysis (see "Stability").
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It has been demonstrated that binding to either one or the other of the two sites yields into a different modulation of the S2 energy level of the xanthophylls (4).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This indicates that the same xanthophyll in the two sites is spectroscopically different.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In agreement, two distinct values for the red-most peak were found for both lutein and violaxanthin, corresponding to the absorption in the L1 and L2 sites.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In contrast, a single neoxanthin spectral form was needed for the best fit of both absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra consisting with its exclusive binding to the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Considering that in the samples containing neoxanthin, violaxanthin and lutein can only be located in the L1 site, it is possible to associate the two absorptions at site L1 or L2 based on the pigment composition of the samples.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Thus, lutein in the L1 site absorbs at 494 nm, whereas in the same site violaxanthin absorbs at 496 nm.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The same description found for the absorption spectra was applied to the analysis of excitation spectra, thus allowing discrimination between the transfer from Car in L1 and L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	254	 It is therefore possible to read the data of Table II with the understanding that notations "1" and "2" actually correspond to xanthophyll binding sites L1 and L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We can conclude that lutein transfers with high efficiency (up to 91%) when in site L1, while its efficiency in exciting Chl a fluorescence is very low (down to 28%) when it is located in the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Violaxanthin transfers efficiently from the L1 site, and the efficiency is around 60% for both violaxanthin and neoxanthin from the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Both violaxanthin and lutein show high (80 to 90%) efficiency from the L1 site, while the decrease in the transfer efficiency from the L2 site is different; lutein decreases its efficiency by a factor of 3.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	258	2, whereas viola decreases its efficiency by a factor of 1.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This suggests that the arrangement of the two xanthophylls in the L2 site is different.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The case of zeaxanthin is even more extreme: its energy transfer efficiency from the L1 site is around 60%, whereas from the L2 site it is very low, if at all.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	261	 These results suggest that the energy transfer from a single site is dependent from the site occupancy.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	262	In general the L2 site seems to be less active in the energy transfer as compared with the L1 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Moreover, the efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl is modulated by the xanthophyll species bound there in the following gradient: V = N  >  L  >  Z.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The lower transfer efficiency from the L2 site, common to all xanthophyll species, indicates that in this site the distance/orientation between pigments is not optimal for excitation energy transfer.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It has been recently observed that most of the transfer from Car to Chl occurs via the S2 Car state in less than 100 fs.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Considering the short carotenoid S2 lifetime, a perfect geometry between donor and acceptor is required for highly efficient energy transfer (3, 4, 6), and small changes in this geometry can strongly influence the process.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Moreover, the finding that the xanthophylls behave differently when bound to the L2 site suggests that this protein domain may change its folding in the presence of different xanthophylls, supporting the proposal that the L2 site has allosteric nature (10).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It is thus possible to suggest that when, for example, lutein enters the site, which is usually occupied by neoxanthin and violaxanthin, a conformational change occurs, changing the relative chromophore orientation and, thus, decreasing the transfer efficiency.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The picture in CP29 is thus different as compared with the case of LHCII, where both L1 and L2 sites showed high efficiency of excitation energy transfer to Chl a (4).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	270	 This suggests the L2 site has a different function in the two proteins.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	271	 In the case of CP29, a Ca2+ and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding site in the loop between helix B and C was suggested to work as a sensor for pH changes in the lumen (37, 38).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding sites have been also found in CP26 (39).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	273	 At low lumenal pH the substitution of the Ca2+ with an H+ would "open" the structure, allowing violaxanthin to exit and zeaxanthin to enter the site (18).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The high flexibility, which is required for this process, can thus explain the low energy transfer efficiency from this site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In the case of LHCII, zeaxanthin never enters the central sites, and thus, the structure could be optimized for the function of excitation energy transfer.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	276	Photoprotection The photobleaching measurements show that samples with two or more xanthophyll species are more resistant to photooxidation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Among the samples containing only one xanthophyll species, CP29-L and CP29-Z are the most sensitive to photo-oxidation.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	278	 It has been proposed above that lutein in site L2 is organized differently compared with the other xanthophylls and in effect does not transfer energy efficiently.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	279	 CP29-Z has only one xanthophyll molecule located in the L1 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The results thus indicate that the L2 site in CP29 can play an important role in photoprotection and, again, that this role is modulated by the site occupancy.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	281	 In this respect, CP29 differs strongly from LHCII for which it has been clearly shown that L1 is the only site active in preventing photooxidation (10).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	282	Do Putative Carotenoid Binding Sequences Participate in Actual Xanthophyll Binding? In the last part of this work, the putative binding sequences for the carotenoids in the L1 and L2 sites have been studied by mutation analysis.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Comparison between the primary structures of Lhc multigenic family members has shown in the loops conserved sequences composed by one charged amino acid hydrophobic residues in between four.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Considering that Lhc proteins cannot bind -carotene, it was argued that these sequences are involved in the xanthophyll binding by establishing an H-bond between the polar residue in the polypeptide stretch and the ring -OH substituent (20).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, our mutation of the four putative binding sequences not only did not decrease pigment-protein stability but also did not change the affinity of binding sites for the different xanthophyll species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The changes in Chl composition observed for the P238R mutant are probably due to changes in the D helix domain and loss of the Chl in A3 site, as suggested by the similar effects of mutation P238R (this work) and Q230L (17) detected by pigment analysis, CD spectroscopy (data not shown), and the heat denaturation kinetics.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The two mutations, which affect the putative stromal binding sequences for xanthophylls in the L2 site (CP29-D50L and CP29-N-term), support the view that pigment-protein stabilization by xanthophyll binding is not provided by hydrophilic sequences.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	288	 A small but reproducible decrease of violaxanthin and neoxanthin balanced by an increase of lutein was, however, consistently found.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	289	 This result may indicate that the sequence encompassing the Asp-50 residue plays a minor role in determining the selectivity of the L2 site.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	290	The pigment binding properties of chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex further support the conclusion that lumenal sequences have little effect on site selectivity: despite the presence of the CP29 sequence in the lumenal region between B and C helices, it still accommodates mostly lutein in the L2 site, as is the case in LHCII (13) rather than violaxanthin and neoxanthin, as in CP29.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Nevertheless, the absence of a clear phenotype for this chimeric complex can be useful in the search of the structural determinants for the affinity of the Car binding sites for individual xanthophyll.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In fact, no effect in xanthophyll composition was observed by either deleting the N-terminal domain down to residue 96 (CP29) or by substituting half of the B helix and the lumenal loop.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	293	 We conclude that the structural determinant for the selectivity of the L2 site has to be located in between these two regions, namely within a 28-amino acid sequence (e.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	294	 from residue 50 to residue 77 in the LHCII sequence).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It has been recently demonstrated that CP26 has the same L2 occupancy as in CP29 (25); this means that the determinant has to be conserved in CP29 and CP26 and not in LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The three sequences are reported in Fig.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The only candidate is the N-61 in LHCII.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	298	 An aromatic amino acid in both CP29 and CP26 occupies this position.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In the structure of LHCII this asparagine is within 5 A from the carotenoid in L2.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The presence in this position of a Phe or Tyr may change the steric interaction between pigments, possibly favoring the binding of violaxanthin and neoxanthin with respect to lutein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This may be due to the difference in the ring orientation between lutein and violaxanthin and neoxanthin; lutein is in its low energy conformation when the -cycle is oriented parallel to the polyene chain, whereas the -cycles of violaxanthin and neoxanthin are oriented perpendicularly.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	302	 This difference can play a role in the selectivity of the binding site; an aromatic group in this site has higher steric hindrance and can select against lutein.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the stringency cannot be very high as lutein is able to enter the L2 site when the reconstitution is performed in the absence of violaxanthin and neoxanthin.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that the CP29-L sample is less stable than the control CP29, and lutein in site L2 is differently oriented in the complex, as proposed above.

0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	307	Although the putative carotenoid binding sequences on the stroma-exposed side of the protein can be somehow involved in the selectivity of the sites for the different xanthophylls, it is quite clear that the stabilization of the carotenoid binding cannot be attributed to these sequences.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Similar results have been obtained for the major light-harvesting complex, LHCII, where the deletion of the N-terminal domain, which contains the putative binding sequence for L1 site, does not influence the carotenoid composition of the complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	309	 The dragging force for the carotenoid binding is most probably to be found in hydrophobic interaction in the portion of the complex inside the membrane in a similar way to that observed in bacteria (40).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Aromatic residues present in A and B helices can be involved in this binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The position of these residues is not conserved in different members of the Lhc family but maintained in the same gene products from different species.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Mutation analysis on the Chl binding residues both in CP29 and LHCII have shown that the interactions between Chls and carotenoids can play a major role in the xanthophylls binding.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In particular, the binding of neoxanthin in the N1 site of LHCII is stabilized by interaction with Chls (14).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	314	 This is consistent with CP29 lacking the N1 site; if the number of Chls in the domain in between helices A and C is lower than in LHCII, then critical Chl-neoxanthin interactions might be lacking.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The loop in between helix A and helix C of CP29 is shorter with respect to the corresponding domain in LHCII; this may bring helix C closer to helix A and, thus, prevent Chl A6, A7, and B1 binding in both CP29 and the chimeric LHCII-CP29 complex.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	316	CP29 is a member of the Lhc family, which is conserved in higher plants and green algae and is involved in light harvesting and protection from abiotic stress.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Knowledge of the biochemical and functional properties of the isolated proteins will contribute to the understanding of the physiological roles of individual gene products in providing stress resistance.
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Recent work showed that during light stress the xanthophyll ligand of site L2 (violaxanthin) is changed into zeaxanthin (18), thus inducing a conformational change leading to fluorescence quenching, whereas the binding of neoxanthin in site N1 stabilizes the unquenched conformation (9, 19).
0.2088173.12601013.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The absence of site N1 in CP29 qualifies this antenna subunit for prompt response to light-induced photoprotective conformational change.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A core group of four open reading frames (ORFs) is present in all known papillomaviruses (PVs): the E1 and E2 replication/transcription proteins and the L1 and L2 structural proteins.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Because they are involved in processes that are essential to PV propagation, the sequences of these proteins are well-conserved.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	4	 However, sequencing of novel subtypes for human papillomaviruses (HPV) 54 (AE9) and 82 (AE2/IS39), coupled to analysis of four other closely related genital HPV pairs, indicated that E2 has a higher dN/dS ratio than E1, L1 or L2.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The elevated ratio is not homogeneous across the length of the ORF, but instead varies with respect to E2's three domains.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The E2 hinge region is of particular interest, because its hypervariability (dN/dS > 1) differs markedly from the two domains that it joins: the transcription-activation domain and the DNA-binding domain.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Deciphering whether the hinge region's high rate of non-synonymous change is the result of positive Darwinian selection or relaxed constraint depends on the evolutionary behaviour of E4, an ORF that overlaps E2.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The E2 hinge region is contained within E4 and non-synonymous changes in the hinge are associated with a disproportionate amount of synonymous change in E4, a case of simultaneous positive and purifying selection in overlapping reading frames.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Modular rates of selection among E2 domains are a likely consequence of the presence of an embedded E4.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	10	 E4 appears to be positioned in a part of the HPV genome that can tolerate non-synonymous change and purifying selection of E4 may be indicative of its functional importance.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Despite an array of types, the development of cervical carcinoma is restricted to a subset of high-risk viruses, of which HPV16 and HPV18 together account for nearly two-thirds of observed cases (Munoz et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Classification of HPV types into categories, such as  cancer-causing  and  non-cancer-causing  or cutaneous and mucosal, is based on both epidemiological and phylogenetic studies (Chan et al.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	18	The typical HPV genome contains six open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the structural proteins (L1 and L2), proteins that mediate the viral life cycle (E1 and E2) and proteins that regulate host-cell DNA replication and transformation (E6 and E7) (Knipe et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	19	 E6 and E7 bind the cell-cycle regulators p53 and pRb, respectively.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Among highly cancerous types, these oncogenes degrade p53 and pRb, resulting in host-cell immortalization and proliferation (reviewed by Fehrmann  and  Laimins, 2003).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Some papillomaviruses (PVs) also encode the E4 and E5 genes, whose roles, although largely unknown, seem to involve functions in the later phases of the viral life cycle (Longworth  and  Laimins, 2004; Peh et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The E5 ORF is situated between E2 and L2 in typical PV genomes.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	24	A great deal of effort has been spent studying the evolutionary implications of overlapping reading frames in viruses (Hein  and  Stovlbaek, 1995; Krakauer, 2000; Miyata  and  Yasunaga, 1978).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A fundamental question is how natural selection operates on two protein sequences encoded by the same stretch of DNA.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We address this question in the context of HPV E2 and E4, highlighting rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution in overlapping reading frames.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	27	 To this end, we utilized two recently cloned and sequenced viral isolates, HPV AE2/IS39 and HPV AE9.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Although initially thought to be novel types (10 % variance in L1 nucleotide sequences) based on sequence analysis of the MY09/MY11 region of the L1 ORF, upon analysis of their complete genomes, HPV AE2/IS39 and HPV AE9 were found to be subtypes (2 to 10 % variance in L1 sequences) of HPV82 and HPV54, respectively.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We focus specifically on the modular rates of selection exhibited by E2 and a possible explanation for this modularity, in the overlapping ORF, E4.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	32	   METHODS Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A cervicovaginal sample containing HPV AE2/IS39 (HPV82 subtype) originated from a white, 22-year-old female with persistent stage 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and a sample containing HPV AE9 (HPV54 subtype) was obtained from a white, 19-year-old female with normal cervical cytology.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	33	 HPV AE2/IS39- and HPV AE9-containing samples were originally detected by MY09/MY11 PCR and dot-blot analyses, as described previously (Tachezy et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	34	, 1994; Terai  and  Burk, 2002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	35	To clone the potentially novel genomes, PCR primers were designed by alignment of closely related HPV genomes using the sequences of the partial L1 region amplified by MY09/MY11 primers.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Additional primers were used to amplify the entire genome in fragments by using overlapping PCR amplification, as described previously (Terai  and  Burk, 2002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	37	 PCR products were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV illumination.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	38	 After confirmation of appropriate product sizes, each PCR product was purified (Qiagen gel-extraction kit) and ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Initially, SP6 and T7 primers flanking each HPV DNA insert were used to determine the nucleotide sequence.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Additional primers were designed by sequence walking.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Sequencing was performed in the Albert Einstein Cancer Center DNA-sequencing facility.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Overlapping fragments were assembled manually and several additional primers were used to clarify sequence ambiguities.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The primer sequences used are available from the authors on request.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	44	Pairwise sequence alignments were performed by using CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	45	, 1994) with a gap cost of 10 0 and the IUB weight matrix.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Multiple sequence alignments, providing prototype and subtype phylogenetic context, were generated in the same way.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Calculation of overall, ORF-wide non-synonymous and synonymous changes and rates of non-synonymous and synonymous change were done by using SNAP (Synonymous/Non-synonymous Analysis Program) (Korber, 2002; Nei  and  Gojobori, 1986) and K-Estimator was used to perform sliding-window analysis of dN/dS (Comeron, 1999).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	48	Phylogenetic trees were constructed in PAUP (version 4.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	49	10) (Swofford, 1998) from multiple sequence alignments of the E6, E7, E1, E2, L2 and L1 concatenated ORFs, using both distance (neighbour-joining) and parsimony methods.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Alignment gaps were coded as missing before distance and parsimony trees were reconstructed by using equal-weighted characters and 100 bootstrap replicates.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	51	 To ensure adequate searches in the tree space, 100 random-addition heuristic searches and TBR (tree bisection and reconnection) swapping were employed.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	52	HPVs used in this study and their GenBank accession numbers are as follows: HPV7 (NC_001595), HPV11 (NC_001525), HPV27 (NC_001584), HPV40 (NC_001589), HPV44 (NC_001689), HPV54 (NC_001676), HPV55 (NC_001692), HPV82 (NC_002172), HPV13 (NC_001349), HPV26 (NC_001583), HPV30 (NC_001585), HPV32 (NC_001586), HPV42 (NC_001534), HPV51 (NC_001533), HPV53 (NC_001593), HPV56 (NC_001594), HPV66 (NC_001695), HPV69 (NC_002171), HPV74 (NC_004501), HPV91 (NC_004085), HPV54A (AF436129) and HPV82A (AF293961).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	53	   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Top ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The genomes of HPV AE2/IS39 (abbreviated as HPV82A) and HPV AE9 (abbreviated as HPV54A) were each amplified and cloned as three overlapping PCR fragments.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For HPV82A, these fragments measured 3 8, 3 9 and 0 5 kb, and for HPV54A, 4 3, 3 6 and 0 5 kb.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The complete genome sequences are available from GenBank under the accession numbers AF436129 (HPV54A) and AF293961 (HPV82A).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	56	The genomes of HPV54A and HPV82A share a high level of similarity with their prototypes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	57	 A comparison of whole genomes reveals 93 5 % nucleic acid similarity between HPV54 and HPV54A, and 89 8 % similarity between HPV82 and HPV82A.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The currently accepted criterion for HPV classification relies on comparison of L1 nucleotide ORFs.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The L1 ORF in the HPV54 pair diverges by 4 6 %, whilst the HPV82 pair diverges by 7 7 %, placing both isolates within the subtype range.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	60	As expected, subtype and prototype genome lengths are also comparable.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	61	 HPV82 and HPV82A are 7871 and 7904 bp, respectively, whilst HPV54 and HPV54A are 7759 and 7717 bp in length.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Each pair contains the anticipated PV ORFs, including the E6 and E7 proteins, the replication proteins (E1 and E2) and components of the viral capsid (L1 and L2).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The only major difference in genomic architecture across the two pairs is HPV54's lack of an E5 homologue.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	64	 HPV82 contains an unambiguous E5 ORF, but lacks a proximal start codon, whereas the corresponding genomic region in HPV54 is as variable as some sections of its upstream regulatory region.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Lack of evidence for E5 in HPV54 reinforces its status as a unique outlier, rooting members of the -PV species clades 1, 8 and 10 (Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	66	 1), all of which contain an intact E5 ORF.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The identification of an HPV54 subtype implies that this ancient part of the tree still appears to be evolving.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In their greater phylogenetic context, HPV82A and HPV54A sort into species groups 5 and 13, respectively.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This evolutionary relationship held in phylogenies constructed from either the concatenated ORFs or L1 nucleotide sequences alone (data not shown) (Fig.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Phylogenetic trees constructed by using maximum-parsimony and distance methods resulted in identical topologies.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Representative cladograms of (a) HPV82 and its taxonomic context and (b) HPV54 and its taxonomic context are shown.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Both trees were based on the alignment of the nucleotide sequences of compiled ORFs (E6, E7, E1, E2, L2 and L1) of the indicated PV genomes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Bootstrap values for the parsimony calculation are provided at all nodes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Numbers to the right indicate the taxonomic species group of the -PVs (de Villiers et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	76	  The distribution of polymorphisms across each ORF within HPV54 and HPV82 is shown in Table 1, accompanied by four closely related genital HPV pairs.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The subtypes HPV44 and HPV55 and the sister taxa HPV6 and HPV11, HPV7 and HPV40, and HPV2 and HPV27 were chosen because they all exhibit whole-genome divergence of  < 15 %.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These closely related pairs allow unambiguous alignment and are less likely to be subject to saturation of genetic variation.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	79	 To examine the possibility of directional selection, we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	80	 A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 indicates neutrality, a ratio  < 1 indicates purifying selection and a ratio  > 1 indicates positive Darwinian selection (Yang, 1998).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Overall, the small ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes and dN/dS values indicate that E1, L1 and L2 are under strong purifying selection, forming a functional core essential to the viral life cycle.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Previously, we had also included E2 in this group because of its presence in all known PVs and its role in viral-genome replication (Narechania et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	83	 However, in the current analysis, a remarkably consistent pattern of elevated non-synonymous E2 variation was observed, a pattern more in line with the values seen for the E6/E7 ORFs than the stable core E1, L1 and L2 ORFs.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The median E2 dN/dS value (0 31) was significantly different from that of the E1/L1/L2 group (0 09) (Mann to Whitney P < 0 0004) (Siegel, 1956).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	85	All values were calculated with SNAP as described by Korber (2000).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	86	  Much of E2's variation is attributable to the hinge region connecting the transcription activation domain (TAD) to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Table 2; Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In all cases except for the HPV54 pair, the hinge region did not manifest the purifying selection that constrains the rest of the E2 ORF (dN/dS median, 1 11).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	88	 HPV16 variant genomes also showed elevated dN/dS ratios in the E2 hinge region (Z.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The TAD and DBD regions display intermediate median dN/dS values (0 18), lower than that for the hinge, but significantly higher than that observed for E1, L1 or L2 (Mann to Whitney P < 0 002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This pattern holds in all cases except for the HPV54 pair.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Aside from a low hinge dN/dS and a high TAD dN/dS, the HPV54 pair also exhibits relatively high E1 and L1 dN/dS ratios, again highlighting its status as a unique outlier of species clades 1, 8 and 10.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Although relatively elevated E2 dN/dS values are a trend that is consistent across all analysed pairs, there are many functional protein motifs that are conserved across all types.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	93	 For example, the -1 recognition helix in the E2 DBD is well-conserved across all types used in the current study, as are the cognate DBD sites (ACCgNNNNcGGT) in the long control region (reviewed by Hegde, 2002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	94	All values were calculated with SNAP as described by Korber (2000).

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Positions of the three functional domains of E2 (TAD, the hinge and DBD) are delimited along the horizontal axis in white, black and grey, respectively.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These positions were derived by alignment to HPV18 E2 (Hegde, 2002).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Vertical lines above the horizontal axis indicate non-synonymous changes (i.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	101	 amino acid changes), whereas those below the axis correspond to synonymous changes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The height of the vertical lines both above and below the horizontal axis represents the number of non-synonymous and synonymous changes per codon, respectively.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	103	  The most compelling observations in the current analysis were the high overall dN/dS ratio of E2 and the concentration of non-synonymous changes in the hinge region of this ORF.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	104	 E2 is unique in the PV genome in that it is the only ORF that completely contains another (in this case, E4).
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Moreover, E4 frames the hinge region completely in all pairs analysed (for two examples, see Fig.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In each sliding-window analysis, except for HPV54 where little time has apparently passed since subtype divergence, non-synonymous changes dominate the E2 reading frame, whereas E4 favours synonymous changes.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This observation is at odds with the prevailing notion concerning overlapping genes  to  that severe evolutionary constraint should operate on nucleotide sequences encoding two layers of protein in the dense genetic environment of viruses (Mizokami et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	108	, 1997; Pavesi, 2000; Pavesi et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	109	 For overlapping genes, codon changes at the third position in one reading frame are unusual, because they result in changes in the second position of the +1 reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, what we see here is a pattern of E4 purifying selection superimposed on the E2 hinge, the one domain that can physically accommodate high levels of non-synonymous change.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The relaxed constraint observed for the hinge is therefore attributable to both its role as a flexible connector between the functionally conserved TAD and DBD domains and the existence of the overlapping E4 reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In PVs with no evidence of an E4 ORF, we might expect this phenomenon to disappear.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	113	 However, to our knowledge, all PVs contain an E4-like ORF except for the two avian PVs that have been characterized to date: Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus (PePV) and Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus (FPV) (Terai et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	114	 An alignment of PePV and FPV E2 ORFs yielded only 52 % identity.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	115	 At this level of divergence, saturation becomes a problem and a satisfactory dN/dS analysis could not be performed.

0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	122	  Despite the claim that constraint should be the rule in overlapping reading frames, more recent reports indicate that some viral genomes demonstrate simultaneous positive and purifying selection.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Simian immunodeficiency virus (Hughes et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	124	, 2001), potato leafroll virus (Guyader  and  Ducray, 2002) and Sendai virus (Fujii et al.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	125	, 2001) all show increased non-synonymous change in one ORF with concurrent dominance of synonymous change in an overlapping reading frame.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We suggest that the modularity displayed in the E2 dN/dS profile is a probable consequence of the presence of the E4 overlapping reading frame, and that the E2 hinge is the ideal genomic position in which to fix an overlapping gene.
0.2511286.15831941.html.plaintext.txt	127	 As E4 is subject to purifying selection relative to the E2 hinge in all tested cases and there is evidence of an E4 ORF in all mammalian PVs, this ORF may have greater functional importance than thought previously.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	3	Efficient catalysis in the second step of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component reaction requires a lipoyl group to be attached to a lipoyl domain that displays appropriately positioned specificity residues.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	4	 As substrates, the human dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase provides an N-terminal (L1) and an inner (L2) lipoyl domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We evaluated the specificity requirements for the E1 reaction with 27 mutant L2 (including four substitutions for the lipoylated lysine, Lys173), with three analogs substituted for the lipoyl group on Lys173, and with selected L1 mutants.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Besides Lys173 mutants, only E170Q mutation prevented lipoylation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Based on analysis of the structural stability of mutants by differential scanning calorimetry, alanine substitutions of residues with aromatic side chains in terminal regions outside the folded portion of the L2 domain significantly decreased the stability of mutant L2, suggesting specific interactions of these terminal regions with the folded domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	8	 E1 reaction rates were markedly reduced by the following substitutions in the L2 domain (equivalent site-L1): L140A, S141A (S14A-L1), T143A, E162A, D172N, and E179A (E52A-L1).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These mutants gave diverse changes in kinetic parameters.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These residues are spread over  > 24 A on one side of the L2 structure, supporting extensive contact between E1 and L2 domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Alignment of over 40 lipoyl domain sequences supports Ser141, Thr143, and Glu179 serving as specificity residues for use by E1 from eukaryotic sources.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Extensive interactions of the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group within the active site are supported by the limited inhibition of E1 acetylation of native L2 by L2 domains altered either by mutation of Lys173 or enzymatic addition of lipoate analogs to Lys173.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, efficient use by mammalian E1 of cognate lipoyl domains derives from unique surface residues with critical interactions contributed by the universal lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group, key specificity residues, and some conserved residues, particularly Asp172 adjacent to Lys173.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	15	The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)1 oxidatively decarboxylates pyruvate with the production of acetyl-CoA and NADH.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The PDC reaction results from the sequential catalysis by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), and the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) components.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In the intermediate steps, the lipoyl groups on mobile lipoyl domains of the E2 are reductively acetylated by E1, de-acetylated by E2, and re-oxidized by E3.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, lipoyl domains play a vital role in connecting the sequential series of reaction catalyzed by these three components.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In mammalian PDC, two lipoyl domains, L1 and L2, and an E1-binding domain are provided in the outer structure of the E2 (1, 2).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These flexibly held domains surround a pentagonal dodecahedron shaped inner core formed by association of 60 C-terminal catalytic domains of E2.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The capacity of lipoyl domains to rapidly move between active sites is provided by highly flexible inter-domain linker segments which are located between the globular domains of E2.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In mammalian PDC-E2 these linker regions are 20 to 30 amino acids in length and are high in alanine and proline residues; prolines introduce stiffness in these interdomain segments (3).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Mammalian PDC has a third lipoyl domain on an E3-binding protein (E3BP) which has a similar segmented structure (1).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	24	In the first step of the E1 reaction, the bound thiamin diphosphate (TPP) forms an adduct with pyruvate which is rapidly decarboxylated to generate 2-(1-hydroxyethylidene)-TPP (HE-TPP) (4).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In the second step, reductive acetylation of a lipoyl group is achieved by linking the oxidation of the hydroxyethylidene group to the reduction of the disulfide in the dithiolane ring of the lipoyl group.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	26	 By either a concerted or sequential mechanism, the acetyl group is introduced onto the thiol formed at the 8-position of the lipoyl group.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The E1 reaction proceeds with high efficiency only with a lipoyl domain substrate.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Known model reactions, coupled or not coupled to artificial electron acceptors, proceed slowly and free lipoate, lipoamide, or lipoyl-lysine are particularly poor acceptors (3).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	29	2 Consistent with the standard two-step mechanism described above, Liu et al.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	30	2 have established by steady state kinetic analyses that rapid E1 catalysis, using natural lipoyl domain substrates, proceeds by a ping-pong reaction sequence.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	31	Thus, the lipoyl domain makes critical contributions to rapid E1 catalysis.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, a set of specificity residues in the lipoyl domain structure is required to allow an E1 source to use its cognate lipoyl domains and not use lipoyl domains from other complexes.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In the case of mammalian PDC, this specific molecular recognition by the E1 component must exclude using the lipoyl domains provided by other mitochondrial systems: the -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the branched chain -keto acid dehydrogenase complex, and the glycine cleavage enzyme.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In marked contrast, the lipoyl domains of all of these multienzyme systems are substrates for a common E3 component which catalyzes the reversible conversion of each of their reduced lipoyl groups to the disulfide form coupled to the reduction of NAD+ (1, 5, 6).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	35	Studies using bacterial PDC E1 and various lipoyl domain sources have delineated structural features of the lipoyl domains that contribute to specific recognition (7, 8).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The first loop in the lipoyl domain structures, which is located adjacent to the lipoyl prosthetic group, was shown to contribute to reaction specificity (8-10).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These studies have focused on residues fairly close to the lipoyl group and have provided limited insights into the relative importance of interactions of the prosthetic group and the lipoyl domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Despite the high specificity of an E1 for its cognate lipoyl domain, only weak interactions between E1 and its lipoyl domain substrate have been detected (11).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	39	2 Indeed, dissociation constants for E1-lipoyl domain interactions appear to be much higher than the Km of E1 for lipoyl domain substrates.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A weak interaction is probably a desirable feature for sustaining high efficiency since the flexibly held lipoyl domains are concentrated in mammalian PDC at  > 1.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	42	The recent crystal structure of the Pseudomonas putida branched chain -keto acid dehydrogenase, also an 22 tetramer, show that the active site is a long funnel requiring the full reach of the lipoyl lysine prosthetic group (14).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Consistent with specificity determining interactions being provided by specific interactions between E1 and the cognate lipoyl domains of a particular complex, it was predicted that the lipoyl domain would need to be positioned close to the surface of the E1 for the reaction to proceed.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Similar requirements for the lipoyl-lysine cofactor to use its length in reaching into deep active sites also formed at subunit interfaces in the E2 (15, 16) and E3 (17) oligomers indicate the extended length of this cofactor is needed to directly support the three catalytic reactions and that the connecting linker regions provide the capacity for movement of the lipoyl domains between active sites (14, 18).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	45	We have used two approaches to evaluate the structural features of the lipoyl domain of human PDC-E2 that contribute to the specificity and efficiency of the reductive acetylation reaction catalyzed by mammalian E1.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	46	 First, we have compared the capacity of mutated human E2 lipoyl domains to serve as substrates in the E1 reaction to determine key specificity residues and other residues important for catalysis.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Mutation of putative specificity residues in the L2 domain was guided by the three-dimensional structure of this domain determined by NMR spectroscopy (19).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Second, to evaluate the contribution of the lipoyl prosthetic group to interactions with E1, we have evaluated the competitive inhibition versus the native domain of lipoyl domains modified at the lysyl-lipoyl prosthetic group either by replacing the lysine with other amino acids or by substituting nonreactive lipoyl analogs onto the lysine side chain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Our studies support extensive interactions between E1 and both the lipoyl domain and the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Consistent with this, deletion of the C-terminal regions of L1 or L2 also led to aggregation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	188	 An interaction of the C-terminal lobe with the surface of L2 was not detected in NMR studies (19) suggesting that any interaction is either weak or condition-dependent.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	227	 NMR studies indicate the specificity loop is somewhat flexible and the side chains tend to extend outward from the folded structure (19).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Substitution of alanine mutation for each of the exposed side chains in this loop (Leu140, Ser141, and Thr143) lowered Tm with the Leu140 mutation causing a 11  degrees C decrease.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In each case H values were also significantly reduced and the apparent S (S = H/Tm, where S is the entropy difference between the unfolded and the folded domain and Tm is in K) values were therefore also reduced relative to native L2 with the largest S decrease (36%) occurring with S141A mutation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	230	 One possibility is that alanine substitution enhances the flexibility of the specificity loop leading to a smaller gain in entropy upon unfolding S141A-L2 while also reducing specific interactions that contribute to stability of the folded domain which also reduces the H difference.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This suggests that significant organization is contributed by the specificity loop in the native structure even though this region is somewhat flexible (19).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	232	Marked decreases in Tm were also observed with L190A and F217A L2 mutants.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This is consistent with loss of a stabilizing interaction involving the C-terminal lobe which results in the tendency of these mutant L2 to aggregate, as described above.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	234	 With L190A and F217A a second transition was observed after the main cooperative melting transition.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The area of this second (but not the first) transition was greatly reduced by increasing the scan rate from 1  degrees C/min to 1.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	236	 That is consistent with the second phase arising from aggregation of the unfolded domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Besides F217A substitution, the D213N (Fig.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	238	 5) and Y220A mutations in the C-terminal lobe caused significant reductions in Tms.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The combination of a reduced Tm with maintenance of high H indicates a S gain with the D213N-L2 mutation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This suggests that the C-terminal lobe has reduced flexibility upon converting Asp to Asn and a larger gain in entropy upon unfolding this structure.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Given the large number of C-terminal residues separating Asp219 from the folded domain, it is surprising that this mutation reduces the H value estimated from melting transitions.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Since the D219N mutation lowered the H by about 20  plus or minus  6 kcal/mol without significantly affecting Tm, this indicates S is significantly decreased, suggesting a decrease in the organization within the C-terminal lobe due to this mutation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Asp219 likely forms an electrostatic interaction that reduces the flexibility of the C-terminal lobe in the native domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Smaller decreases in H were estimated for other substitutions in C-terminal residues (Y220A and R221A) suggesting Tyr220 and Arg221 contribute to structure within this lobe.

0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	345	 All of the mutant domains, that had major effects on E1 activity, were well behaved in native gel electrophoresis and, with the exception of L140A-L2 mutant, unfolded with Tm values in excess of 64  degrees C.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	346	 We would emphasize that D170Q-L2, which was not lipoylated gave near wild type values in DSC and CD studies indicating it had a near native structure.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Thus, our studies further support the concept that lipoylation requires both proper folding and the presentation of essential residues.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Since the lipoyl domains used to test E1 function were well lipoylated, that further supports their retaining a well folded structure that properly presented the tight turn bearing Lys173 for the lipoylation reaction.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	349	The specificity loop 1 (Leu140, Ser141, and Thr143), the conserved Asp172 and, anterior to those residues, Glu179 and Glu162 are located on one side of the L2 domain (panel B, Fig.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	350	 1) in a region abundant in acidic residues (10 on the folded part of the domain).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Glu179 is located in a long -strand leading away from Lys173; its -C is 16 A from Ser141 and the -C of these amino acids are separated by 19 A and 11 A, respectively, from the -C of Lys173.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Glu162 is located an additional 6 A behind Glu179.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	353	 These acidic residues are well separated from basic residues; this is in contrast to the acidic residues that line the bottom edge of the panel B structure.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Electrostatic interactions of Glu162 and Glu179 with basic residues at the surface of E1 are predicted to contribute to the E1-L2 complex.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Thus, E1 interacts over a substantial region with the surface of the lipoyl domain.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The opposite side of the lipoyl domain has a hydrophobic face (Fig.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	357	 1, panel C) with Leu190 in the center and prominent residues, Arg196, Asp197, and Thr145, which were not important for E1 catalysis.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Apparently, there is very limited interaction of E1 with this side of the lipoyl domain structure although mutation of Val156 and Leu190 reduced activity.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	359	The mutants developed here have been used to establish specificity residues for specific kinase and phosphatase isoforms.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	360	5 Those studies have revealed an overlapping pattern in supporting of the function of the regulatory enzymes and E1 but also established the involvement of many distinct residues and large differences in the relative importance of overlapping residues.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	361	 This further indicates that these established mutations do not propagate extended changes in the structure of the lipoyl domain to thereby interfere with normal lipoyl domain roles.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Now that this initial mapping has been achieved, further substitutions at the key specificity sites should greatly add to our understanding of the roles and relative importance of these key specificity residues in the L2 domain for E1 function.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	363	Based on the capacity of lipoylated L2 to compete very effectively versus analogs lacking structural features of the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group, structural requirements for the interaction of the lipoyl prosthetic group include distinct structural features, probably including active site complementarity favoring binding of the dithiolane ring of the lipoate prosthetic group.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	364	 The stronger inhibition in substituting a Gln rather than Ala or Met for Lys173, probably results from Gln participating in H-bonding with E1 which cannot be formed by the Met and Ala side chains.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	365	 However, the alternative explanation that the Gln participates in a relatively stable internal H-bond within the lipoyl domain that enhances binding to E1 cannot be eliminated.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Since extensive interactions between E1 and L2 are supported and yet, to date, the binding of the lipoyl domains to E1 appear to be weak (Kd well above Km values (11)),2 this suggests that intrinsic interaction energy is used to facilitate catalysis.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	367	 That is consistent with the high specificity for cognate lipoyl domains of an E1 source of an -keto acid dehydrogenase complex and with the extraordinarily slow use of free lipoamide as a substrate (3).
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Thus, it seems likely that productive E1-lipoyl domain interactions facilitate structural changes within E1 that aid catalytic turnover such as facilitating a slight repositioning of the HE-TPP intermediate formed after decarboxylation to aid efficient reductive acetylation.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	369	Overall, we conclude that in the second step of the ping-pong reaction catalyzed by mammalian E1 reaction, the specificity for reductive acetylation of its cognate lipoyl domain is governed by unique surface residues spread primarily along the upper edge of the folded L2 structure shown in Fig.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Additional critical interactions of the universal lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group and preceding Asp residue (Asp172 in L2) contribute to catalysis.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Although E1 function was not affected by mutations in terminal regions, substitutions, particularly in the C-terminal lobe, were shown by DSC studies to contribute to the ordered structure of L2.
0.21141487.10788482.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Further structural studies will be required to determine the how this lobe is structured and the degree to which it interacts with the  barrel structure within the domain.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A novel method employing filter arrays of a cDNA expression library for the identification of substrates for protein kinases was developed.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	5	 With this technique, we identified a new member of the cyclin family, cyclin L2, as a substrate of the nuclear protein kinase DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Cyclin L2 contains an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich domain (RS domain), which is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The gene for cyclin L2 encodes the full-length cyclin L2, which is predominantly expressed in testis, as well as a truncated splicing variant (cyclin L2S) that lacks the RS domain and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Full-length cyclin L2, but not cyclin L2S, was associated with the cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Cyclin L2 interacted with splicing factor 2 in vitro and was co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in the nuclear speckle compartment.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Photobleaching experiments showed that a fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and cyclin L2 in nuclear speckles rapidly exchanged with unbleached molecules in the nucleus, similar to other RS domain-containing proteins.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In striking contrast, the closely related green fluorescent protein-cyclin L1 was immobile in the speckle compartment.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	12	 DYRK1A interacted with cyclin L2 in pull-down assays, and overexpression of DYRK1A stimulated phosphorylation of cyclin L2 in COS-7 cells.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These data characterize cyclin L2 as a highly mobile component of nuclear speckles and suggest that DYRK1A may regulate splicing by phosphorylation of cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) is a nuclear protein kinase that appears to play an important role in brain development (for a review, see Ref.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The first evidence for a role of DYRK1A in neurogenesis came from its similarity with the Drosophila orthologue, the minibrain kinase (2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mutant flies with a reduced expression of minibrain show a significant reduction of neurons in distinct areas of the brain, correlated with specific behavioral defects (2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, the human DYRK1A gene is located on chromosome 21 in the "Down syndrome critical region" (3 to 5).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Consistent with a potential involvement of the DYRK1A gene in the pathogenesis of mental retardation in Down syndrome, overexpression of DYRK1A in transgenic mice causes learning deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (5, 6).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Furthermore, mice heterozygous for a targeted deletion of the Dyrk1a gene (Dyrk1a+/- mice) develop abnormal brain morphology (7).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In early embryonal development, DYRK1A is expressed in neural progenitor cells during the transition from proliferating to neurogenic divisions (8).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Altogether, these findings suggest a relevant function of DYRK1A during neuronal development, related to proliferation and/or differentiation.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	22	In recent years, several transcription factors have been identified as substrates of DYRK1A (for a review, see Ref.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Particularly, overexpression of DYRK1A has been shown to modulate the transactivation potential of FKHR (forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma) (10, 11), cAMP-response element-binding protein (12), and GLI1 (13).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Cytoplasmic proteins like eukaryotic initiation factor 2B, tau (14), and dynamin (15) have also been reported to be phosphorylated by DYRK1A, but these proteins might equally well be targets of the cytoplasmic kinases DYRK2 or DYRK3.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, although DYRK1A contains a canonical nuclear localization signal and is indeed predominantly targeted to the nucleus (16, 17), a significant fraction of the kinase is also present in the cytoplasm (18).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Within the nucleus, DYRK1A is localized in "nuclear speckles," which represent the splicing factor compartment (17, 19).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The precise function of DYRK1A in the nucleus is still largely unknown, and it is an open question whether any of the known substrates of DYRK1A is a key mediator of its functions on cell differentiation and proliferation.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We have therefore performed a more extensive search for interacting proteins and substrates to address this problem.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several methods have been employed to identify novel substrates of protein kinases.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Routine interaction screens like the yeast two-hybrid system, phage display, and phage expression library screening, yield in many cases substrates of kinases (20 to 23).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Other approaches are based on the specificity of substrate recognition by kinases and aim to identify substrate proteins by searching data bases with experimentally determined or predicted consensus phosphorylation sequences (24, 25).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	32	 More direct strategies include the phosphorylation screening of phage expression libraries (26) or of cell lysates (27), and the identification of phosphoproteins by functional proteomics and mass spectrometry (28).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	33	Here we have employed a new method which allowed us to screen in parallel for interaction partners and substrates of the kinase DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In this approach, we used an arrayed protein expression library (29, 30) both for interaction screening by overlaying with the radiolabeled recombinant kinase (31), and for a substrate screen by solid phase phosphorylation (26).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The use of the filter array allowed us to directly identify positive clones without the need of further rounds of purification.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Several DYRK1A-interacting and/or phosphorylated proteins were identified by this approach, and one protein was found in both screens.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This protein turned out to be a novel member of the cyclin family and was designated cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	38	Here we characterize cyclin L2 as a novel substrate of DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Furthermore, we describe the alternative transcripts generated from the cyclin L2 gene and show that full-length cyclin L2, but not the truncated splicing variant cyclin L2S, is co-localized with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Using photobleaching techniques, we demonstrate that cyclin L2 and the closely related isoform, cyclin L1, differ strikingly with regard to their intranuclear mobility.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Human fetal brain cDNA was directionally cloned into the pQE-30NST vector (GenBankTM accession number AF074376 [GenBank] ) for isopropyl-1-thio--D-galactopyranoside-inducible expression of His6-tagged fusion proteins.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	225	 1A, right panel; only a section of the array is shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	226	 34 strongly reacting cDNA clones were further characterized, including three clones that were also identified in the interaction screen.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	227	 By solid phase phosphorylation of bacterially expressed fusion proteins, all of the selected proteins were confirmed to be in vitro substrates of DYRK1A (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	234	 A total of four proteins with RS domains were identified (SFRS4, cyclin L2, SFRS5, and SWAP2) as in vitro substrates of DYRK1A, suggesting that DYRK1A may be involved in splicing catalysis.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	235	 We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays to compare the phosphorylation of RS domain-containing proteins by DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In addition to the proteins identified in the present screen, two additional RS domain-containing proteins (hTRA21 and SF2/ASF) and a well characterized in vitro substrate of DYRK1A (myelin basic protein) (34) were included in this experiment.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Thus, DYRK1A does not indiscriminately phosphorylate serine residues in the context of RS domains.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In the present study, we concentrated on the characterization of cyclin L2 and its interaction with DYRK1A, because this protein was independently identified in both screens and because cyclin L2 was an excellent substrate of DYRK1A (see below; Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	242	 By a data base search, we identified an uncharacterized full-length mRNA sequence corresponding to these partial cDNAs (GenBankTM accession number AY037150 [GenBank] ).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The deduced protein encoded by this cDNA exhibits high sequence similarity with cyclin L1 (HUGO gene symbol CCNL1), a recently characterized protein with an N-terminal cyclin domain and a C-terminal RS domain (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Therefore, we designated the protein encoded by AY037150 [GenBank] cyclin L2 (HUGO gene symbol CCNL2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The mouse homologues of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 have previously been named Ania-6a and Ania-6b, respectively (41).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The cyclin domain of cyclin L2 (amino acids 69 to 296, as indicated in Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	247	 3A) was defined by comparison with cyclin H, which has been modeled by Andersen et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The cyclin domains of cyclin L1 and L2 are most closely related with cyclin K (HUGO gene symbol CCNK; 33% identical amino acids) and cyclin T1/T2 (HUGO gene symbols CCNT1 and CCNT2; 30 and 32% identical amino acids).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The RS domains of cyclin L1 and L2 contain 45% identical amino acids, a range that was also found for RS domains of known splicing factors.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	250	Genomic Organization of CCNL2 The human CCNL2 gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The gene spans about 13 kb and comprises 11 exons (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The comparison of the genomic sequence with public expressed sequence tag sequences allowed us to deduce the existence of three different transcripts, T1 to T3 (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The different transcripts are generated by alternative splicing of exon 6a and by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites within exon 6a.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Inclusion of exon 6a introduces a stop codon, and therefore transcripts T1 and T3 encode a truncated version of cyclin L2 that lacks the RS domain (cyclin L2S, "s" represents "short," Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Because exon 6a is skipped in transcript T2, the resulting mRNA (AY037150 [GenBank] ) encodes the long version of the protein, which is named cyclin L2 and includes the RS domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	256	Alternatively Spliced Transcripts of CCNL2 and CCNL1  We performed Northern blot analyses with exon-specific hybridization probes (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	257	 3C) and PCR analysis in order to determine the expression pattern of CCNL2 in different tissues and to verify the existence of the hypothesized transcripts of the CCNL2 gene.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	258	 On Northern blots of RNA from different human tissues, two major bands of about 4.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Transcript T1, which encodes cyclin L2S, was ubiquitously found in all tissues tested, although signal intensities varied.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In ovary, testis, prostate, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver, T1 appeared to be more abundant than in blood, colon, lung, and brain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In contrast, transcript T2 was weakly detected in a few tissues (skeletal muscle, and spleen), and only testis RNA contained comparable levels of both transcripts (T1 and T2).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	264	4-kb transcript (T2) appears as a double band on the autoradiogram, because there are two polyadenylation sites in exon 11 that are separated by 211 bp (see Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	265	 To confirm the identification of T1 and T2, we hybridized identical blots with a probe derived from the 5'-end of exon 6a (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	294	 This result suggests that alternative transcripts of CCNL1 are generated in the same way as T1 and T2 of CCNL2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Consistent with this identification of the bands in the Northern blot, a probe equivalent to E6a-5' detected only the longer transcript of CCNL1 (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	296	 No transcript of CCNL1 was detected that corresponded to T3 of CCNL2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	297	 As in CCNL2, a stop codon in the longer transcript results in a truncated version of the protein.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	298	 These data suggest that alternative splicing occurs in the same way in both isoforms of cyclin L; inclusion of exon 6a of CCNL2 or the corresponding region of CCNL1 leads to a larger transcript, which encodes a truncated protein lacking the RS-domain and part of the cyclin domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	299	To confirm the identification of the bands detected by Northern blot analysis, we characterized the ratio of the cyclin L2 transcripts in different tissues by PCR analysis.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	300	 We designed exon-specific primers to amplify transcripts T1/T3, coding for the short protein (cyclin L2S), and transcript T2, coding for the long form (cyclin L2) (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Combination of the three primers in a single reaction (multiplex PCR) allowed us to compare the expression ratios of T1/T3 with T2 in different tissues (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	302	 It should be noted that the ratio of the PCR products is not necessarily equal to the ratio of the respective cDNA sequences, because the different products may have been amplified with different efficiencies.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the data indicate whether this ratio differs between different samples (e.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	304	 4C, transcript T2 was detected in all tissues analyzed except for human brain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Nevertheless, transcript T2 was readily amplified from brain cDNA when only T2-specific primers were used for the PCR (data not shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Consistent with the Northern blot data, stronger signals were obtained in most tissues for transcripts T1/T3 than for T2, except for testis, which contained relatively higher levels of T2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	307	 In mouse tissues, the ratio of T2 and T1/T3 was also higher in testis than in brain (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Moreover, an antibody specific for the C-terminal domain of cyclin L2 detected a band of about 65 kDa in Western blots of mouse testis, matching the size of full-length cyclin L2 as deduced from transcript T2 (data not shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	309	Localization of Cyclin L1 and Cyclin L2 to the Nuclear Speckle Compartment Many splicing factors with RS domains are localized in subnuclear structures called nuclear speckles (44).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Therefore, we generated GFP fusion constructs of cyclin L2, cyclin L2S, and cyclin L1 in order to study the subcellular localization of these proteins by fluorescence microscopy.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Interestingly, cells overexpressing GFP-CycL1 consistently exhibited an altered appearance of the SC-35 containing speckles compared with untransfected cells.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Quantitative analysis showed that the recovery of fluorescence was fast (initial t of 3 to 5 s) but incomplete (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	328	 This result shows that GFP-CycL2 in nuclear speckles consists of a highly mobile and an immobile fraction.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Repetitive bleaching of a small area of the nucleus (1  microm) free of nuclear speckles significantly reduced the total nuclear GFP fluorescence of GFPCycL2 expressing cells, indicating that a substantial fraction of the protein has moved through the area subjected to bleaching within the period of 60 s (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	342	 In contrast, GFP-CycL1 fluorescence was affected exclusively in the bleaching area itself but remained unchanged in the remaining volume of the nucleus.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Notably, sequence similarity between DYRK2 and DYRK1A is limited to the catalytic domain and a short segment immediately N-terminal of the catalytic domain that we earlier designated the "DYRK homology box" (DH box) (48).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	361	 The DH box contains a large number of negative charges (35) and may thus bind the RS domain of cyclin L2 by ionic interactions.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Screening of phage libraries by overlay assay with radiolabeled proteins as well as substrate screening by solid phase phosphorylation have previously been employed to identify kinase substrates (21, 26).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The main advantage of using the filter array for screening is the possibility to directly isolate positive clones without further rounds of purification.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	408	 The second advantage is that the expression plasmids isolated from the library can be directly used for functional assays.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	409	 These advantages made it feasible to select 58 positive clones to verify the original screening results with recombinant proteins (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	410	 All tested clones were able to bind to DYRK1A and/or to be phosphorylated by DYRK1A, demonstrating the reliability of the screening results.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Disregarding the cloning artifacts, we identified a high proportion of nuclear proteins that are potential downstream targets of DYRK1A, in particular the splicing proteins and transcription factors listed in Table I.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	412	 The present work provides a more detailed characterization of a novel member of the cyclin family, cyclin L2, as an interaction partner and substrate of DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	413	Cyclin L2 and the closely related isoform, cyclin L1 (originally named cyclin L (39)) differ from all other members of the cyclin family by the presence of a C-terminal RS domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	414	 This unusual domain structure is conserved in the homologous proteins from invertebrates and plants (Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, and Arabidopsis (41)), providing evidence for a conserved function of the RS domain in these proteins.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	415	 The RS domain is a hallmark of many proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing, including the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins), which contain at least one RNA-binding motif, and the SR protein-related polypeptides (50, 51, 47, 52).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	416	 SR protein-related polypeptides constitute an inhomogeneous family of proteins that contain the RS domain in combination with additional domains (e.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	417	 the protein kinase domains in CLK1-CLK4 and CrkRS/CRK7 or the DEAD/H box in RNA helicases) (47, 52).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	418	 The modular domain architecture of cyclin L1 and L2 is thus a typical feature of SR protein-related proteins, although unusual for members of the cyclin family.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	419	RS domains mediate protein-protein interactions with other proteins that contain RS repeats, and they target proteins to the nuclear speckle compartment (50).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Here we show that cyclin L2 interacts with the alternative splicing factor SF2/ASF (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	421	 7) and is co-localized with the SR protein SC35 in nuclear speckles (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	422	 This subcellular distribution is very likely mediated by the RS domain, since a construct of cyclin L2 that lacked the major part of the cyclin domain (cyclin L21 to 222) exhibited a subnuclear distribution indistinguishable from that of the full-length construct (data not shown).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	423	 In contrast, cyclin L2S, which lacks the RS domain, was distributed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Cyclin L1 was also found to be co-localized with SC35, as previously shown by Berke et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	425	 However, cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 differed strikingly in regard to their intranuclear mobility.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	426	Photobleaching experiments showed that a significant fraction of GFP-CycL2 in nuclear speckles was rapidly exchanged by unbleached molecules within the nucleus (FRAP analysis; Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Moreover, FLIP analysis showed that a considerable portion of nuclear GFP-CycL2 transits a given small region of the nucleus within a time period of 60 s (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	428	 6B), indicating that the protein diffuses freely in the nucleoplasm when not associated with speckles.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	429	 In contrast, GFP-CycL1 was found immobile in both FRAP and FLIP analysis.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	430	 To our knowledge, the observation that GFP-CycL1 is an immobile component of nuclear speckles is unprecedented in the analysis of proteins with RS domains (for a review, see Ref.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	431	 The different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2 indicate that the proteins have different functions despite their highly similar structures.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	432	 Presently, we can only speculate on the reason for the different mobilities of cyclin L1 and cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	433	 The fact that cyclin L1 was co-immunoprecipitated with PITSLREp110 argues against the possibility that the GFP fusion protein is grossly misfolded in the cell.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Instead, the association of cyclin L1 with its cyclin dependent kinase, PITSLREp110, may constrain the mobility of cyclin L1, whereas the association of cyclin L2 and PITSLREp110 appears weaker (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	435	Altogether, the presence of the RS domain, the interaction with SF2/ASF, and the localization in the nuclear speckle compartment suggest a role of cyclin L2 in the regulation of RNA splicing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	436	 Cyclin L1 has previously been reported to stimulate an in vitro splicing reaction (39).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	437	 Notably, however, speckles have also been shown to contain proteins other than splicing factors, including 3'-end mRNA-processing factors, the cyclin T1-CDK9 complex, and the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (53 to 55).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Thus, a function of cyclin L2 in the control of transcription or another step of pre-mRNA processing cannot be excluded.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	439	Based on sequence comparisons of the cyclin box, cyclin L2 belongs to a group of cyclins involved in transcriptional regulation, comprising cyclins H, K, T1, and T2 (Fig.

0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	442	 The dendrogram was constructed from an alignment of the cyclin (Cyc) domains with the help of the Clustal program (66).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	443	 The branch of transcriptional cyclins is highlighted by boldface type.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	444	 Data base (Swiss-Prot) accession numbers are as follows: cyclin K, O75909 [GenBank] ; cyclin T1, O60563 [GenBank] ; cyclin T2, O60583 [GenBank] ; cyclin H, P51946 [GenBank] ; cyclin A1, P78396 [GenBank] ; cyclin B1, P14635 [GenBank] ; cyclin D1, P24385 [GenBank] ; cyclin E1, P24864 [GenBank] .
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	445	  These cyclins, in association with the corresponding cyclin-dependent kinases, are components of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (cyclin H-CDK7) or the transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (cyclin T-CDK9 and cyclin K-CDK9) (56).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	446	 The present data show that cyclin L2 binds in vivo to the cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLREp110, as previously also demonstrated for cyclin L1 (41, 39).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	447	 PITSLRE (also named CDK11 (57) or Cdc2-like 1 (official gene symbol CDC2L1)) exists in more than 20 splicing variants (58).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	448	 PITSLREp110 isoforms are localized in the nucleus and are co-localized in nuclear speckles with the splicing protein RNPS1 (59).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	449	 Here we show that cyclin L2 is co-localized with SC35 in the splicing factor compartment, supporting the hypothesis that cyclin L2 and PITSLREp110 are associated in vivo.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	450	 Recent reports provide evidence that PITSLRE participates in a signaling pathway that coordinates transcription and RNA processing events (57, 60).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	451	 It should be noted that in our coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	452	 8), cyclin L2 did not interact as strongly with PITSLREp110 as it did with cyclin L1, and we cannot exclude the possibility that related kinases such as CDK10/PISSLRE or CDK7 may act as the catalytically active partner of cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	453	Interestingly, we have identified a short variant of cyclin L2 (cyclin L2S) that lacks the RS domain and part of the cyclin box.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	454	 Sequence comparisons of the human gene for cyclin L2 (CCNL2) and its transcripts allowed us to deduce the alternatively spliced transcripts for the long and the short variant (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	455	 The exon/intron structure of the gene for cyclin L1 (CCNL1) is nearly identical to that of CCNL2, and CCNL1 results in the same alternative splicing variants coding for full-length cyclin L1 and a short isoform of cyclin L1 (cyclin L1S, designated Ania-6a25 by Berke et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	456	 By Northern blot analysis with exon-specific probes, we could unambiguously identify the larger transcripts of about 4.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	457	 4A) as the mRNA for the short polypeptides (cyclin L1S and L2S).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	458	 This result is in agreement with the analysis of the murine cyclin L1 transcripts by Berke et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	459	 (41) and improves the characterization of the human CCNL1 gene and its transcripts performed by Dickinson et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	460	The alternative splicing variants of cyclin L1 and L2 are differentially expressed in human tissues (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	461	 In most tissues, the mRNA levels for full-length cyclin L1 (T2) were comparable with or higher than those for cyclin L1S.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	462	 In contrast, the mRNA for full-length cyclin L2 was detected mainly in testis, whereas the short variant, cyclin L2S, was nearly ubiquitously expressed.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Furthermore, we found that the transcripts of CCNL1 and CCNL2 were differentially regulated by extracellular stimuli; phorbol ester and cycloheximide specifically induced the mRNA for full-length cyclin L1 in human RT112 keratinocytes, whereas levels of the cyclin L2 transcripts were only weakly affected by cycloheximide and not at all by phorbol ester.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	464	2 These results are in accordance with a more extensive analysis of cyclin L1 expression in rat neurons by Berke et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	465	 (41), who identified CCNL1 as an immediate early gene induced by cocaine and dopamine.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Taken together, the present characterization of the cyclin L2 gene suggests that CCNL1 and CCNL2 originated by gene duplication and have acquired different patterns of expression by divergent evolution of their promoters.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	467	The fact that both splicing variants are conserved in the paralogous genes CCNL1 and CCNL2, together with their differential patterns of expression, argues against the possibility that cyclin L1S and L2S are products of irregular splicing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	468	 However, the cyclin domain and the RS domain are truncated or completely absent, respectively, in cyclin L1S and L2S.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	469	 Cyclin L2S neither interacts with PITSLREp110, most likely because of its incomplete cyclin box (as defined by Andersen et al.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	470	 (42)), nor is localized to nuclear speckles.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Identical results have been reported for cyclin L1S (39, 41).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	472	 The existence of these short variants with no apparent function is reminiscent of the alternative splicing in the CLK kinases (61).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	473	 CLK1 is regulated through alternative splicing of the CLK1 pre-mRNA, yielding mRNAs encoding the catalytically active kinase and truncated polypeptides lacking the kinase domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	474	 CLK1 regulates splicing by phosphorylation of SR proteins and controls its own expression, since the presence of the active kinase favors the production of the truncated, inactive polypeptide (61).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	475	 There are other known cases of splicing factors that are subject to autoregulation by alternative splicing (62, 63), and we hypothesize that the existence of the short splicing variants of cyclins L1 and L2 provides a means to control the levels of the full-length proteins at the level of splicing.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	476	We have characterized cyclin L2 both as a substrate and an interaction partner of the protein kinase DYRK1A.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	477	 It appears plausible that these proteins also interact in vivo, since DYRK1A has previously been found to be localized in nuclear speckles (17, 19).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	478	 The original cyclin L2 clone isolated from the expression library lacked the cyclin domain, thus allowing the conclusion that DYRK1A interacts with the RS domain of cyclin L2.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	479	 The results of the pull-down assays indicate that the catalytic domain of DYRK1A alone is able to bind cyclin L2 but that this interaction is greatly enhanced by the presence of a small conserved region preceding the catalytic domain, called the DH box.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	480	 This region contains a large number of acidic residues (35) and is conserved in all kinases of the DYRK family and in several related kinases that are involved in the regulation of splicing (CLK family, PRP4 (48)).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	481	 It appears reasonable to assume that the negatively charged DH box is engaged in ionic interactions with the positively charged RS domain.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	482	DYRK1A phosphorylated cyclin L2 in vitro within the C-terminal domain, but the three in vitro phosphorylation sites identified in the present study were not located within RS repeat motifs (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	483	 This finding confirms our previous classification of DYRK1A as a proline-directed kinase (35).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	484	 Notably, none of the target sites in cyclin L2 contains an arginine residue in position P-2 or P-3 that we and others have previously found to be critical for substrate recognition (14, 34, 64).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	485	 We could further show that cyclin L2 is indeed a phosphoprotein when expressed in COS-7 cells.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	486	 The phosphate content of cyclin L2 was not significantly altered by co-expressed DYRK1A (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	487	 10A), probably because RS domains are generally highly phosphorylated by endogenous kinases (47).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	488	 However, overexpression in COS-7 cells of catalytically active DYRK1A, but not of a kinase-inactive mutant, induced a mobility of shift of cyclin L2, resembling the result of the in vitro phosphorylation of His6-CycL2 by DYRK1A (Fig.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	489	 This result strongly suggests that DYRK1A directly phosphorylates cyclin L2 in living cells.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	490	 The phosphorylation of SR proteins is necessary for their recruitment from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription/pre-mRNA processing (44, 65).
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	491	 (19) have recently reported that kinase-active DYRK1A, but not an inactive point mutant, induced speckle disassembly.
0.18519257.14623875.html.plaintext.txt	492	 However, it remains to be determined whether phosphorylation of cyclin L2 is involved in this action of DYRK1A.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	42	To verify that the engineered mutant was indeed incapable of expressing the UL25 gene product, we performed Western blotting analyses of protein extracts from RK13 cells infected for different periods of time with either BHV-1 or BHV-1UL25.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	43	 2(A), extracts infected with BHV-1 revealed the presence of an abundant 63 kDa protein, which was detected specifically with the UL25 antiserum, accumulating in cells from 12 to 18 h post-infection (p.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	56	  To investigate the consequence of the UL25 defect on the replicative cycle of BHV-1, virus production was examined by establishing one-step growth curves of both BHV-1UL25 and BHV-1 in non-complementing RK13 as well as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	60	 BHV-1 was capable of replicating efficiently in both RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells, reaching similar maximal virus yields at 21 h p.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In contrast, BHV-1UL25 could only replicate in RK13/UL25+ cells, as no progeny was produced in RK13 cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These results demonstrate that the UL25 gene product is necessary for virus replication in non-complementing cells, as was observed also with an HSV-1 UL25 deletion mutant (Ali et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In addition, the virus yield obtained with BHV-1UL25 on RK13/UL25+ cells was similar to that of BHV-1 virus yield recovered from either cell line, indicating that the RK13/UL25+ cell line was capable of fully complementing the UL25 defect of the mutant virus.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	64	 These results demonstrate that the amount of the UL25 protein within the complementary cell line is sufficient to allow replication of BHV-1UL25 to BHV-1 levels, indicating that no mutations in other essential genes had been introduced during the recombination event giving rise to the mutant.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	65	To identify the step at which the UL25 deletion mutant replication aborts in RK13 cells, we examined whether the mutation compromised the expression of late viral genes products.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	66	 For this purpose, the expression of the BHV-1 gene trans-inducing factor protein encoded by the UL48 gene, a late gene (Misra et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	67	, protein lysates were prepared from BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells and analysed by immunoblot for the presence of the UL48 gene product using a BHV-1-specific UL48 antiserum directed against an Escherichia coli-expressed T7 tag to UL48 fusion protein.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The antiserum detected a 50 kDa protein in lysates collected at 18 h p.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	69	 from both BHV-1UL25- and BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Moreover, the production of the UL48 gene product was abrogated by PAA treatment (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	71	 2C, +PAA), confirming further that UL48 is a 2 gene.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Thus, these results demonstrate that the UL25 defect does not impair the expression of viral genes of the 2 class or, consequently, the expression of genes of the earlier classes (, 1, 2 and 1).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	73	 These results also demonstrate indirectly that the mutation does not compromise viral DNA synthesis, since genes whose expression is dependent strictly on viral DNA synthesis (such as UL48) are expressed efficiently.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	74	To obtain direct evidence that the UL25 defect does not compromise viral DNA synthesis in RK13 cells, Southern blotting analysis of HindIII digests of total cell DNA isolated from BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 and RK13/UL25+ cells was performed.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The HindIII fragment N, representing the leftward terminal region of the BHV-1 linear viral genome, was used as probe (Fig.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The 2 4 kbp bands common to the two profiles co-migrated with the KpnI to HindIII insert of the recombinant plasmid pKS/Nhd, which harbours the complete HindIII fragment N (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	82	 3A, lane 5), demonstrating that these bands represented the leftward terminal 2 4 kbp HindIII fragment N of the BHV-1 linear genome.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The sizes of the other two bands correlated to those expected for head-to-tail HindIII genomic fragments (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	84	 1, N to F and N to H head-to-tail fragments are in the range of 14 and 15 kbp, respectively), indicating the presence within infected cell lysates of viral DNA, which was in the form of either immature DNA concatemers or of circular unit-length genomes, or both.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Interestingly, the levels of the 2 4 kbp fragment observed were similar in the two cell lines.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	86	 These findings indicate that DNA replication of BHV-1UL25 is as effective in RK13 cells as in complementing RK13/UL25+ cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Moreover, the much higher abundance of terminal versus head-to-tail HindIII fragments indicate that mutant viral DNA synthesized in infected cells is processed efficiently into linear unit-length genomes.

0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	102	, were examined by transmission electron microscopy to assess the presence of full (C), intermediate (B) and empty (A) capsids, as described previously (Desloges  and  Simard, 2003).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Significant numbers of all three capsid types were found on sections from both BHV-1-infected RK13 cells (A capsids, 35 7 %; B capsids, 16 7 %; C capsids, 47 6 %) and BHV-1UL25-infected RK13/UL25+ cells (A capsids, 29 6 %; B capsids, 51 7 %; C capsids, 18 7 %).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Each of these infected cell samples (Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	105	 3B, upper left and right panels, respectively) presented several C capsids surrounded by a bilayer envelope.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In contrast, most of the capsids in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells were of types A and B (40 0 and 57 2 %, respectively), as illustrated in Fig.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	107	 3(B, lower left panel), showing an accumulation of both capsid types in infected cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The generation of empty A capsids devoid of both DNA and internal structure is believed to result from an abortive packaging event.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Abortive packaging has been observed also in mutants of the dsDNA bacteriophage P22, which presents similarities to alphaherpesviruses concerning the DNA packaging and capsid assembly process.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In Salmonella cells infected with mutants of phage P22 defective in genes 4, 10 and 26, it was shown that the procapsids are assembled and that viral concatemeric DNA is packaged but that the newly filled capsids are unstable and lose their DNA (Strauss  and  King, 1984).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The phenotype observed in bacterial cells infected with these mutants is an accumulation of empty A capsids, similar to those observed in BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	112	However, careful examination of these infected cells revealed the presence of few electron-dense cored C capsids (2 8 %).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	113	 3(B, lower right panel), in which a complete enveloped C capsid is shown in the extracellular compartment of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	114	 It was reported previously that the HSV-1 UL25 mutant (KUL25NS) does not package matur DNA (McNab et al.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Recently, Stow (2001) detected successfully low levels of KUL25NS DNA being packaged and retained into capsids.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The latter findings are corroborated in the present study by the observation of few full C capsids in electron micrographs of thin sections of BHV-1UL25-infected RK13 cells.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, it appears that these enveloped C capsids were either non-infectious or their number was too low for cytopathogenesis, as no virus was detected in one-step growth curve analyses.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Also, it could be that UL25 mutant genomes are packaged efficiently into capsids but are released subsequently and then degraded rapidly, as suggested by Stow (2001).
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	119	In summary, we describe the engineering and characterization of a UL25 deletion mutant of BHV-1.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Our results show that the mutant is not impaired in its ability to synthesize viral proteins and to replicate and cleave viral DNA into unit-length genomes.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Moreover, the mutant is still able to encapsidate viral DNA, albeit at very low levels.
0.14988111.12917469.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Further studies will be required to elucidate more precisely the role played by UL25 in the encapsidation process and especially in the stabilization of the packaged DNA into the capsid.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hemolysin BL (HBL) is a unique membrane-lytic toxin from Bacillus cereus composed of three distinct proteins, designated B, L1, and L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	4	 HBL produces a paradoxical zone phenomenon in gel diffusion assays in sheep blood agar.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Lysis does not begin immediately adjacent to the source of diffusion; rather, it begins several millimeters away.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Cells near the source and at intersections of lysis zones remain intact longer.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we developed a spectrophotometric hemolysis assay system that measures the activities of the individual HBL components and used it to analyze the mechanisms of hemolysis and the paradoxical zone phenomenon.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The B component was rate-limiting, and erythrocytes were slowly primed by B at an optimal concentration of about 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	9	3 nM to rapid lytic action by the combination of the L components (L1+2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	10	 All of the individual components bound to cells independently, and membrane-associated HBL components were neutralized by specific antibodies, suggesting that lysis was caused by formation of a membrane attack complex on the cell surface.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Osmotic protection experiments indicate a colloid osmotic lysis mechanism.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Concentrations of the B component above 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	13	3 nM caused inhibition of L1-mediated lysis, and L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B over a similar concentration range.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	14	 From analyses of spectrophotometric and diffusion assays we constructed a basic model for the interactions between HBL components and for the paradoxical zone phenomenon in blood agar.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the latter, areas of slow lysis near diffusion sources are caused primarily by the accumulation of inhibitory levels of L1 reached before cells are primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	16	Bacillus cereus secretes hemolysin BL (HBL),1 a membrane-lytic system composed of three antigenically distinct proteins thought to contribute to diarrheal food poisoning (1) and necrotizing infections such as endophthalmitis (2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Separately, the HBL components are nontoxic, but when combined they exhibit a variety of toxic activities including hemolysis, cytotoxicity, vascular permeability, dermonecrosis, enterotoxicity, and ocular toxicity (1, 2, 3, 4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	18	 When HBL diffuses from a bacterial colony or a well in blood agar, it produces an unusual discontinuous hemolysis pattern (5), called a paradoxical zone phenomenon (6).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Lysis begins away from the well or colony, followed by slow lysis nearer the source (5).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A similar zone phenomenon is seen in spectrophotometric assays in which there is decreased hemolysis at HBL concentrations above a maximally effective dose (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	21	HBL is the first known three-component bacterial toxin.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The components are designated B, L1, and L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	23	2 kDa, and their pI values are 5.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	24	33 (4), as determined electrophoretically.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The genes for all three components have been cloned, and the sequences have been determined (7, 8).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The amino acid sequences predicted from the nucleotide sequences are in complete agreement with published N-terminal amino acid sequences determined chemically (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	27	 All of the proteins appear unique and exhibit no significant similarity with other known proteins.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The three genes are immediately adjacent to one another, apparently in an operon (8).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Methods for purification of relatively large quantities of pure HBL components were developed only recently (4); therefore, little is known about the mode of action of HBL at the molecular level.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	30	Here we present a novel hemolysis assay system that has provided significant insight into the mechanism and interactions of HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These assays are based on a fundamental difference between the activities of the B and L components and allow analysis of the activities of the individual HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	32	 When sheep erythrocytes were treated with B they did not lyse, but they slowly became primed to lysis by the combination of the two L components (L1+2).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The discrete proportion of cells primed at a given time could be used as a measure of the activity of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The priming reaction, which took less than 1 h at 42  degrees C could be nearly stopped by reducing the temperature to 22  degrees C or below, creating a quasistable population of B-primed red blood cells (RBC-B).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The addition of L1+2 to RBC-B at 22  degrees C caused rapid lysis of cells that was over 3000 times faster than the priming rate at that temperature.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Consequently, numerous samples of the L components could be analyzed against an RBC-B preparation with little change in the primed cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	37	All three HBL components bound to erythrocytes independently of the others.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Complete neutralization of membrane-bound L components by specific antibodies suggest that HBL causes hemolysis via the interaction of at least the L components in a "membrane attack complex" and not by enzymatic degradation of the membrane.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Osmotic protection experiments indicated that lysis was by a colloid osmotic mechanism through transmembrane pores.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	40	Analysis also indicated that concentrations of B above 1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	41	3 nM caused inhibition of the lysis of RBC-B by L1 in the presence of L2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Conversely, excess L1 inhibited the priming reaction of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The data suggest that B and L1 each inhibit the other above a threshold concentration relative to the concentration of a membrane component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The L2 component was required for lysis, but it exhibited little or no interference with the other components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	45	From these observations we propose a model for the paradoxical zone phenomenon seen in gel diffusion assays.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Hemolysis is slow near the HBL source because excess (and therefore inhibitory) concentrations of B and L1 accumulate before cells can be primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The initial location of lysis occurs at a point at which the diffusion rate has decreased enough so that the rate of priming by B exceeds the rate at which excess components accumulate.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The IgG fractions were purified with a fast protein liquid chromatography system, using a Protein G-Superose column as per the instructions of the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	57	 When tested in double immunodiffusion and dot blot assays, the titers of the antibodies to components B and L2 were roughly equal and were 2-4 times higher than those of the antibodies to L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The antibodies were highly specific for their respective antigens and exhibited no cross-reactivity to the other HBL components in double immunodiffusion assays or on Western blots.

0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	241	An implication of the above observations is that, in blood agar, the inhibition of lysis near the HBL diffusion source and at the intersections of lysis zones (10) is a function of the mutual inhibitory activity between B and L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	242	 To test this idea, the separated components were added to wells adjacent to wells containing all three components (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Consistent with the above observations, the L1 component inhibited lysis in the adjacent zone, and the L2 component had no apparent effect on the adjacent pattern.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Lysis was enhanced adjacent to the B component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This superficially contradicts the observation that excess B inhibits lysis by L1, but it is consistent with the overall kinetics of the system, as discussed below.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	246	Among the greater than 300 described bacterial toxins, there are several that require two different, individually soluble, proteins for toxic activity (11) but none that require three components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	247	 These binary toxins include staphylococcal -hemolysin and the related leukocidins (12, 13); anthrax toxin (14); Clostridium botulinum C2 and the related toxins of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium spiroforme, and Clostridium difficile (15); and Bacillus sphaericus binary toxin (16).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	248	 For all of these (except possibly the B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	249	 sphaericus toxin), the components exhibit a compulsory cell-binding order.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Also the protective antigen of anthrax toxin, which acts as a docking protein, must be cleaved by a cellular protease before the complementary proteins will bind.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The observations presented here allowed us to address related questions about the mechanism of HBL and helped answer three basic questions.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Does HBL cause lysis enzymatically or by formation of a membrane attack complex? Do the HBL components act randomly or in a compulsory order? What is the basis for the paradoxical zone phenomenon exhibited by HBL?.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	253	Hemolysins are thought to lyse cells by two general mechanisms (17).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	254	 First, the cell surface may be enzymatically altered to an extent that causes membrane degeneration.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This usually involves phospholipases, and there are numerous examples of hemolysis that require two enzymes acting in a compulsory order (18).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In some systems a phospholipase acts on the cell, which is subsequently lysed by a nonphospholipase enzyme or nonenzymatic protein.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In the second hemolysis mechanism, lysin molecules insert into the membrane and form functional transmembrane pores (19), or "leaky patches" (20).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Such lesions are generally composed of oligomers of one protein or multiple proteins.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Complement is an example of a lytic system that produces lesions composed of more than one different protein.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Complement lesions are called membrane attack complexes (MACs) to account for their multicomponent composition (21).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Hemolysins may also exhibit detergent-like activity and "solubilize" membranes, but this mechanism may not occur for hemolytic proteins (17).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	262	 3 demonstrates that both L components bound to erythrocyte membranes independently of any other HBL component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	263	 After priming of L1- or L2-treated and washed cells by B, the addition of antibodies specific to either membrane-bound L component completely neutralized hemolysis by the complementary L component.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	264	 This indicates that the L components remained associated with the membranes after washing and that each needed to be present for a competent lytic lesion to be formed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It also strongly suggests that a competent lesion is only formed when L1 and L2 physically interact on the cell surface, which, by definition, describes a MAC.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	266	 If the L components were simple enzymes that caused lysis by independently damaging membranes, then antibodies to an L component would not reverse the membrane damage and protect cells from lysis by the other HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	267	 It appears, therefore, that HBL ultimately causes lysis by forming a lesion analogous to a complement MAC that has a minimum structure consisting of an L1-L2 heterodimer.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Osmotic protection of erythrocytes treated with HBL (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	269	 2) suggests that the putative MAC results in formation of transmembrane pores but does not indicate whether the pores are protein-lined or simply perturbations of the phospholipid bilayer surrounding the HBL components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	270	Antibodies specific for the B component also interfered with the ability of the L components to lyse B-primed cells (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	271	 4), suggesting that L components interact with B to form an integral three-component heteromeric membrane lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, although the anti-B antibodies completely neutralized the autonomous priming reaction of B, they could only partially inhibit lysis once cells were primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	273	 If HBL lysis does involve a three-component MAC, there are several possibilities as to what might occur during the priming reaction that decreases the ability of the anti-B antibodies to neutralize lysis.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	274	 During priming, the B component may insert into the membrane, possibly forming oligomers.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	275	 This would allow antibodies to bind only to exposed portions of B and not to portions sequestered within the membrane.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Any conformational changes experienced by B might also decrease the avidity of antibodies prepared to its native conformation.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	277	 It is also possible that B is altered by a membrane component, such as occurs in the proteolytic processing of the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (14).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Antibodies prepared to native B may bind poorly to the processed version.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	279	The inability of anti-B antibodies to completely neutralize lysis of RBC-B by L1+2 might also be diagnostic of an enzymatic mechanism for B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	280	 A situation can be envisioned in which B binds to a membrane and converts a substrate to a product that is subsequently recognized by the L components, leading to lysis.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	281	 If the product was to accumulate in a pool in the immediate vicinity of the membrane-bound B, partial inhibition might occur if B-associated antibody sterically prevented access of L components to the product.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Such a mechanism seems rather unlikely, but it cannot be ruled out with present observations.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	283	The next question addressed by our data is whether the HBL components act in an ordered or random manner.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	284	 1 and 3 that all three HBL components bind to erythrocytes independently (i.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, as pointed out by Ponder in 1948 (6), hemolysis is a relatively complex multistep process.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Pore assembly models for staphylococcal -toxin and for streptolysin O provide examples of such a multistep process (22).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	287	 -Toxin monomers bind to membranes, diffuse laterally into a prepore complex on the membrane surface, and subsequently insert and form pores.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	288	 SLO also binds as monomers and then undergoes a rate-limiting nucleation process involving formation of dimers on the membrane surface, followed by dimer insertion, and then rapid accumulation of monomers around the dimer nucleus to form the functional lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The complexity of these processes demonstrates that simple association of toxin components with erythrocytes does not provide a picture of the overall hemolysis mechanism.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	290	Our evidence suggests that HBL components form pores after they form a complex.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The L1 and L2 components rapidly contribute to the complex in a manner that does not appear to depend on the sequence of their addition.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, the B component clearly must undergo an autonomous, rate-limiting reaction before a functional lesion can be formed with the L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Therefore, although all of the components bind independently to the cell, final lesion formation appears to follow a specific order with respect to the B and L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	294	 It is possible that the appearance of an ordered reaction is an artifact of the kinetics of the individual components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	295	 All of the components might undergo analogous independent priming reactions, with the reaction of B being extremely slow relative to the reactions of the L components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	296	 However, our data suggest that the priming process followed by B is fundamentally different from those followed by the L components, because antibodies could completely protect cells when reacted with either membrane-associated L component, but not when reacted with B-primed cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	297	The cause of the paradoxical zone phenomenon of HBL is the third major mechanistic question addressed by these data.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	298	 5 and 6 indicate that B and L1 are mutually inhibitory above a threshold concentration and that this antagonism is responsible for the paradoxical hemolysis behavior seen in gel diffusion and suspension assays.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	299	In a dose-response curve for the priming reaction of B (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	300	 5A), the lysis velocity (reaction 2 in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	301	 1A) of L1+2 decreased with increasing concentrations of B even when most cells were primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	302	 5B shows that lysis velocity could be inhibited even if Bi was added after cells were completely primed (100% RBC-B).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	303	 The inhibition of lysis did not increase if RBC-B were pretreated with Bi (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	304	 5B, inset), indicating that inhibition was not due to an enzymatic action of Bi on the cells.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Inhibition decreased, however, if Bi was added after L1 (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	306	 5, B and C), indicating that Bi interferes with the incorporation of L1 into the lesion and not with the function of a preformed lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	307	The kinetics of the inhibition of L1 by B in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Inhibition decreased linearly with time (r = 0.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This suggests a first order process for the incorporation of L1 into lesions, which is in distinct contrast to the complex shape of hemolysis curves.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	310	 This type of measurement was possible only because of the special situation in which B does not appear to interfere with lysis once L1 has been incorporated into a lesion.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	311	 6 shows that, above a threshold concentration, L1 also inhibited the priming reaction of B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The dose-response of L1-mediated inhibition of the priming reaction was nearly identical to that for inhibition of L1 by excess B (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In addition, excess L1 inhibited hemolysis caused by HBL placed in adjacent wells in blood agar (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	314	The hemolysis data presented here provide an explanation for the paradoxical zone phenomenon of HBL and the lysis patterns seen in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	315	 HBL hemolysis in blood agar is discontinuous and begins away from a well containing the components.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	316	 However, diffusing molecules create a continuous concentration gradient, and the components must therefore reach a concentration that promotes hemolysis at every point between the well edge and the zone in which lysis begins; this is the paradox, and we propose the following model to explain it.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	317	 A cell will not lyse unless it has been primed by B, and maximal priming occurs only at permissive concentrations of B and L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	318	 When membrane-bound B or L1 exceeds a critical ratio versus a membrane constituent, the other component is inhibited from forming a functional lesion (or perhaps produces an inefficient lesion).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Priming by B is slow and, since L1 can inhibit B at any time during the reaction (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	320	 6A, insert), priming is inhibited near a well when L1 diffuses rapidly enough to accumulate to inhibitory levels before cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Hemolysis only begins in a zone in which the B concentration is high enough to prime cells, but the diffusion rate of L1 is too low for it to reach an inhibitory concentration before the cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Inhibition at the intersections of zones is due to accumulation of excess L1 before cells are primed.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	323	 It is unlikely that inhibition is caused by an excess ratio of B to L1 or vice versa, because a paradoxical zone phenomenon occurs in suspension assays simply by increasing the concentration of all three components at a constant ratio of each to the others (4).
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	324	The influence on hemolysis patterns of the inhibitory effect of L1 is seen in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Just as lysis is inhibited at the intersections of HBL hemolysis zones, lysis was also inhibited at the intersection of an HBL hemolysis zone and an L1 diffusion zone.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	326	 6A, L2 had no appreciable effect on an adjacent hemolysis pattern.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The enhanced lysis between wells containing either HBL or B only seems contradictory in light of the observation that excess B inhibits lysis by L1, but it is consistent with the mechanism of HBL.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The B component primes cells independently of the other components (Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	329	 1, B and C), and once primed, cells are rapidly lysed by any concentration of L1+2.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The lysis within the B diffusion zone occurred simply because cells were primed by B in the absence of inhibitory concentrations of L1.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The priming reaction of B is over 1000 times slower than the lytic action of L1 at room temperature.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Therefore, even in the presence of excess B, the lysis rate of RBC-B will not be noticeably slower than the rate at which cells are primed by B.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	333	 On the other hand, any inhibition by L1 of the priming reaction of B should be profoundly evident.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	334	 This seems to be born out in the lysis patterns in Fig.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	335	Our hemolysis data provide some insights into the mechanism of HBL, which appears to involve novel modes of interactions between proteins and membranes.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	336	 The three proteins that comprise HBL are collectively called a toxin because of an early simplifying assumption that they represent a single functional unit to the bacterium that produces them.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	337	 This work supports that assumption.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	338	 New findings show that the genes for all three components are arranged immediately adjacent to one another, probably in an operon (8), lending additional weight to the idea that the three proteins comprise a functional unit.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	339	 HBL is unlike any previously described cytolytic toxin, from its complex composition to the unique hemolytic phenomena that it causes.
0.18831623.8995253.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Further study of this toxin promises to add a new perspective to perceptions about the mechanisms and utility of cytolytic toxins.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	1	* Laboratory of Structural Biology, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases;  Computational Bioscience and Engineering Laboratory, Division of Computer Research and Technology;   Laboratory of Biochemistry and Genetics, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892; and   Department of Biology, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York 11973 Abstract Materials and Methods Results Discussion Footnotes Acknowledgements Abbreviations used in this paper References.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	2	The genomes of double-stranded (ds)RNA viruses are never exposed to the cytoplasm but are confined to and replicated from a specialized protein-bound compartmentthe viral capsid.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	3	 We have used cryoelectron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to study this compartment in the case of L-A, a yeast virus whose capsid consists of 60 asymmetric dimers of Gag protein (76 kD).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	4	 At 16-A resolution, we distinguish multiple domains in the elongated Gag subunits, whose nonequivalent packing is reflected in subtly different morphologies of the two protomers.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Small holes, 10-15 A across, perforate the capsid wall, which functions as a molecular sieve, allowing the exit of transcripts and the influx of metabolites, while retaining dsRNA and excluding degradative enzymes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Scanning transmission electron microscope measurements of mass-per-unit length suggest that L-A RNA is an A-form duplex, and that RNA filaments emanating from disrupted virions often consist of two or more closely associated duplexes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Nuclease protection experiments confirm that the genome is entirely sequestered inside full capsids, but it is packed relatively loosely; in L-A, the center-to-center spacing between duplexes is 40-45 A, compared with 25-30 A in other double-stranded viruses.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The looser packing of L-A RNA allows for maneuverability in the crowded capsid interior, in which the genome (in both replication and transcription) must be translocated sequentially past the polymerase immobilized on the inner capsid wall.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	9	IN eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells alike, the medium in which genetic information is stored is double-stranded (ds)1 DNA.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	10	 From this repository, genes are copied in the same medium (replication) or into different media (transcription and translation).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Viruses, more limited but less constrained genetic entities than cells, exhibit greater diversity in their replication cycles.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	12	 All four alternative media, single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, dsDNA, and dsRNA, are used by different virus families to encode their genomes (for review see Roizman and Palese, 1996).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Whereas dsDNA and ssRNA molecules are abundant cellular components, dsRNA and ssDNA molecules are not.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In these circumstances, one might expect viruses of the latter kinds to have developed special strategies for interfacing with the metabolic resources of their host cells.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	15	One such strategy that is widespread if not universal among dsRNA viruses is their use of capsids as specialized cytoplasmic compartments that genomes are confined to, and are replicated and expressed from (Dryden et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Such capsids are selectively porous protein shells that the genome and replicase reside within, nucleotides infuse into, and nascent strands (positive sense) are extruded from.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	17	The present study addresses the capsid structure and the organization of encapsidated RNA in the L-A virus of yeast, an excellent model system because of its relative simplicity and well-known molecular biology.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	18	6-kbp, single-segment molecule that encodes a major capsid protein (Gag; 680 residues, 76 kD) and a minor capsid protein.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The latter molecule is a fusion of Gag with Pol, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol; 868 residues, 100 kD) (Fujimura and Wickner, 1988a; Icho and Wickner, 1989) that is generated by ribosomal frameshifting (Dinman et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The L-A capsid is a spherical particle, ~430 A in diam, composed of 120 copies of Gag (Esteban and Wickner, 1986; Cheng et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	21	, 1994), of which approximately two carry the Pol moiety (Dinman and Wickner, 1992; Ribas, J.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Its surface lattice has the unusual property of being composed of 60 asymmetric dimers (Cheng et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 1994), configured as an otherwise conventional icosahedron of triangulation class T = 1 (Caspar and Klug, 1962).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Interestingly, 120-subunit capsids have been detected in several other dsRNA viruses, including bacteriophage 6 (Mindich and Bamford, 1988), reovirus (Dryden et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	25	, 1993), orbivirus (Burroughs et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	26	, 1995), aquareovirus (Shaw et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	27	, 1996), and rotavirus (Estes, 1996), but thus far, in no other kind of virus.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	28	Motivated by the expanding generality of this unusual capsid stoichiometry and architecture and the prospect of gaining insight into the features that commend it as a compartment for the sequestration and replication of dsRNA, we have pursued further cryoelectron microscopic studies of the L-A capsid, extending the resolution to 16 A.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Using these data, we have also examined the structural organization of the viral genome, both in the encapsidated state and as released from virions.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Complementary information was obtained by using dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Wall and Hainfeld, 1986; Thomas et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	31	, 1994) to measure the mass per unit length of L-A chromosomes extruding directly from capsids, and after isolation.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The virus-containing fractions were dialyzed against buffer A (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	37	8) for 6 h, and stored at ~20 mg/ml at 4 degrees C.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	38	 All samples were used within 7 d of purification, as L-A virions tend to lose their dsRNA upon protracted storage.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	39	Virions to be examined by cryoelectron microscopy were dialyzed against buffer A for 8-12 h to remove CsCl.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	40	 They were then diluted in buffer A until (when examined by negative staining) a uniform, dense but not continuous, distribution of particles was observed.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	41	 5- microl drops of virus at this concentration (typically, 2-5 mg/ml) were applied to holey carbon films on 400 mesh copper grids, and observed by cryoelectron microscopy, essentially as described (Booy et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Micrographs were recorded under minimal exposure conditions at nominal magnifications of  x 36,000 or  x 46,000 (~8 e/A2) on Kodak SO-163 films, using an electron microscope (EM400RT; Philips Technologies, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with modified Gatan anticontaminator blades and a Gatan 626 cryoholder (Gatan, Warrendale, PA).

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	44	5-A axial spacing of its tail-sheath (Moody and Makowski, 1981) was used as an internal magnification standard.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Micrographs were assessed for resolution and stigmation by optical diffraction of large areas, and their defocus values estimated from the positions of the first zero of the contrast transfer function (CTF).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	46	 For the micrographs chosen for analysis, the first zero was in the range of (15 A)1-(27 A)1 (Table I).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Underfocus values () were calculated according to  = 1/k2 , where  is the wavelength of the 100 keV electrons (0.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The positions and spread of the peaks in these spectra give statistically representative estimates of the predominant spacings between RNA filaments packed in L-A virus capsids.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Because the shape of a spectrum depends on the defocus of the micrographs from which it was calculated, this analysis was repeated for micrographs covering a range of defocus values.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	58	 It shows a much weaker peak in the same frequency range indicative of the defocus value at which this micrograph was recorded, and confirms that the strong peak in the full particle spectrum reflects scattering from the viral RNA.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Particles were extracted and preprocessed using the automated procedure of Conway et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Particle orientations were determined by means of the Polar Fourier Transform algorithm, an iterative, model-based procedure (Baker and Cheng, 1996).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	79	 As a starting model, we used our earlier 26A resolution three-dimensional (3-D) map of empty L-A particles (Cheng et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In all micrographs analyzed, reconstructions of empty and full particles were calculated separately, using Fourier-Bessel techniques (Crowther, 1971; Fuller, 1987; Baker et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Complete icosahedral (532) symmetry was imposed on the final density map.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The contour level imposed for surface rendering was based on 100% of expected volume, assuming a protein density of 1.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Resolution of the three-dimensional maps was estimated in terms of a Fourier shell correlation procedure (Saxton and Baumeister, 1982; Conway et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	84	, 1993), and was, in each case, very close to the first zero of the CTF.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Data quality was also assessed by eigenvalue spectra (Fuller et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	86	To obtain a distribution of particle orientations that uniformly cover the asymmetric unit (Baker et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	87	, 1989), data from three micrographs were combined.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	88	 All three micrographs were well stigmated and had first zeros at ~(15 A)1.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Three independent reconstructions were first calculated and mutually scaled to the same magnification and density by matching their spherically averaged radial density profiles (Booy et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	90	 A composite reconstruction including  > 80 particles (Table I) was then calculated, the orientation and alignment parameters of each particle refined, and a final map calculated.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The resolution was 16 A by the above criterion.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	92	To visualize the internal contents of full particles, we first calculated reconstructions from micrographs recorded at several different defocus values.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The contribution of the capsid shell to each such image was obtained by reprojecting the three-dimensional map in the corresponding orientation, after setting the internal densities to background (solvent) level.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Finally, the projected capsid shell was subtracted from the raw image (Baker et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	95	, 1991), thus providing an unobstructed view of the encapsidated dsRNA.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	96	 As a control, the same procedure was applied to images of empty particles.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Diffraction patterns were calculated for all difference images in each data set.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	98	 These were then added together with equal weighting (combining empty and full particles separately), and azimuthally averaged to obtain the respective one-dimensional powder patterns.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Here, fewer data are available, but we note a definite morphological similarity between L-A capsid and the core of Bluetongue virus (Hewat et al.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This reaction should be controlled by some switching event that specifies the A and B conformations (Johnson, 1996).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	294	 This switch may operate at the level of dimer formation, yielding protomers of which 60 equivalent copies would then self-assemble into a conventional T = 1 icosahedron.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	311	 While their sizes may be revised somewhat when higher resolution data become available, current estimates suggest a strategically useful property.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	312	 None of these holes is large enough to pass an A-form duplex (~23-A diam), but the largest holes (triangular, average distance from apex to base ~15 A; Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	313	 3 e) should readily allow passage of an ssRNA molecule.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Thus the capsid appears to be configured to function as a molecular sieve: duplex RNA is retained inside, but transcripts may exit.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	315	 It would be expedient for freshly synthesized transcript to be fed directly into an exit port (Fig.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	316	 8), as this would forestall formation of secondary structure that might impede export.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Since there are only one to two copies of Pol per capsid, presumably no more than two transcripts per capsid are being exported at any one time.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	318	 However, the other holes should facilitate the infusion of nucleotides, of which a steady supply is required to sustain synthesis during transcription or replication.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	319	 A further filtering property is that the holes are presumably small enough to exclude potentially degradative enzymes.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	335	, 1993); these are relatively highly ordered and tightly packed, with center-to-center spacings of 25-30 A.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	336	 In part, the larger spacing in L-A reflects the fact that A-form duplexes are wider than B-form duplexes.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	337	 However, the average interduplex spacing may be calculated independently from the volume available (average internal capsid diam = 348 A) and genome length (1.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Assuming quasi-hexagonal close packing to a uniform density, a spacing of ~40 A is obtained.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	339	 There is some flexibility in this figure, arising from the center being less populated with RNA, the packing not being perfectly crystalline, and possibly also from some local compaction into multistranded filaments (see below).

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Its consistency supports our inferences that (a) the dsRNA genome is fully internalized, and (b) its packing is much looser than in other double-stranded viruses.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	352	 This occurs by "headful replication," whereby one viral (+) strand is packaged, and replicates inside the particle until it is full.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	355	 We can think of two explanations.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	356	 In one, the Gag gene has evolved recently to provide a more capacious capsid, but the genome as a whole has not yet evolved to fully exploit this opportunity for expansion.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	357	 The fact that the multisegmented satellites do not package RNA more densely than L-A appears to argue against this hypothesis.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	358	In the second explanation, we speculate that the maximum viable packing density may be dictated by a requirement for long range mobility of the dsRNA in this transcriptionally active particle.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The polymerase is thought to reside on the inner surface, anchored by integration of its Gag moiety into the surface lattice (Wickner, 1996a,b).
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	360	 8), large tracts of dsRNA must be propelled sequentially past this fixed point.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	361	 In so doing, the organization of the entire packaged genome must undergo constant revision, or "churning" motion.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	364	 The ability of L-A Pol to function in replication and transcription depends on its being capable of overcoming the frictional drag imposed by the packaged genome.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	365	 We infer that this resistance increases with higher packing density, whence the observed packing density may represent the highest level of frictional resistance against which the enzyme can function effectively.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	366	 This idea is testable by generating insertions in the L-A genome.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	367	Is a similar mechanism operative in other dsRNA viruses? The consideration that dsRNA appears to be packed more densely in the cores of both reovirus (Dryden et al.

0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	369	, 1996) than in L-A might suggest otherwise.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	370	 However, these systems, in which transcriptionally active particles have been visualized (Yeager, M.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	371	, 1997), are considerably more complex; more proteins and many more RNA segments are involved, and precisely calibrated spacings for their packaged genomes have yet to be reported.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Transcription of reovirions is thought to require "activation" by proteases, and concomitant conformational changes (Powell et al.
0.17798969.9281577.html.plaintext.txt	373	, 1993), which, we conjecture, may rearrange the core structure, so as to facilitate motion of the dsRNA during transcription.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E2 proteins are the major viral regulators of transcription and replication during the viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In addition to these conserved functions, we show that E2 proteins from high risk HPV types 16 and 18, which are associated with cervical cancer, can induce apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In contrast, E2 proteins from low risk HPV types 6 and 11, which are associated with benign lesions, do not cause cell death.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We show that the ability to induce apoptosis is linked to the intracellular localization of the respective E2 proteins rather than to inherent properties of the proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although low risk HPV E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear, high risk HPV E2 proteins are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of expressing cells due to exportin-1 receptor (CRM1)-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Induction of apoptosis is caused by accumulation of E2 in the cytoplasm and involves caspase 8 activation.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We speculate that disruption of the E2 gene during viral genome integration in cervical carcinoma provides a means to avoid E2-induced apoptosis and allow initiation of carcinogenesis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human papillomaviruses are the etiologic agents of cervical cancer, and they are found associated with more than 90% of this type of cancer.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Viruses infecting the anogenital tract can be divided into two distinct classes that are associated either with benign lesions (such as HPV4 types 6 and 11) or with cancer (such as HPV types 16 and 18).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The class of high risk HPVs associated with cervical carcinoma expresses two oncogenes, E6 and E7, which transform the cells by negatively interfering with the p53 and pRB pathways (1, 2).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In contrast, the E6 and E7 proteins of low risk HPVs have been shown to be unable to induce cellular transformation in vitro (for review, see Ref.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	15	The HPV E2 protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	16	 E2 proteins are transcription factors that can repress transcription of the E6 and E7 genes of the genital papillomaviruses independently of their oncogenic potential (4 to 8).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Transcriptional repression was shown to result from binding of E2 to sequences within the E6 and E7 early promoters of high risk as well as low risk HPVs (5, 9 to 12).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Other properties of the E2 proteins are also conserved, such as their ability to activate transcription of heterologous promoters containing at least two E2 binding sites in a specific configuration and to activate viral DNA replication in concert with the E1 helicase (13).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Comparative analyses of E2 proteins of high risk and low risk HPV viruses suggested a high degree of conservation in their three-dimensional structure, compatible with their conserved functions in viral DNA replication and transcription (14 to 17).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	20	E2 proteins have also been shown to directly influence host cell biology.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In particular, proapoptotic activity has been demonstrated for the HPV18 E2 protein (18, 19) as well as the HPV16 E2 protein (20) and was shown to be an intrinsic property independent of transcription (18, 19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	22	 More recently, an interaction between E2 and mitotic chromosomes was described through direct interaction with Brd4, a bromodomain protein associated with acetylated chromatin (21).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	23	 E2 is also associated with the mitotic spindles via tubulin interactions, which was proposed to take part in the segregation of viral genomes during cell division (22).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Finally, we also recently described a novel interaction of high risk HPV E2 proteins with activators of the mitotic ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) which, by inhibiting the degradation of various APC/C substrates, results in a strong genomic instability (23).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These additional functions of the E2 proteins are mediated by direct interactions with cellular proteins rather than through transcriptional control and were shown to be independent of other viral functions.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	26	The E2 proteins are composed of three distinct domains that can be expressed separately and retain their function (24).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The carboxyl-terminal domain forms a small -barrel dimer which binds to specific recognition sequences on the DNA (25).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A hinge domain, with no specific structure, mainly serves as a flexible linker between the two functional domains.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The amino-terminal domain is composed of two sub-domains separated by a fulcrum; one contains three -helices (at its amino-terminal end), and the other is composed of a succession of -sheets (at its carboxyl-terminal end) (15, 16).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The amino-terminal domain retains functions of E2 involved in regulating transcription and replication.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Above all, it has been shown to interact with cellular proteins involved in transactivation as well as with the E1 helicase that activates viral DNA replication (15, 26) and with Brd4 involved in episomal segregation during mitosis (21).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Other characteristics, such as ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (24) as well as induction of apoptosis (19) involve this domain.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The proapoptotic property of HPV18 E2 has been shown to depend on induction of the extrinsic pathway through activation of caspase 8 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The exact mechanism of this activation is not yet understood, but it appears that E2 activates caspase 8 through direct protein-protein interaction.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	35	5 Induction of apoptosis has also been shown to occur with the HPV16 E2 protein, although the mechanism is not fully understood (20).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	36	In the present work we sought to examine whether some of the autonomous properties of the HPV E2 proteins could differ among virus types, as was shown before for the E6 and E7 proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We examined whether the proapoptotic property of the HPV18 E2 protein is conserved among E2 proteins of other genital HPV subtypes.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	38	 We fused GFP at the amino terminus of the HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 E2 proteins and used recombinant adenoviruses to express them as previously described for HPV18 E2 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Subcellular localization of the E2 proteins appeared strikingly different; the E2 proteins from low risk viruses HPV6 and HPV11 were exclusively nuclear, whereas proteins from high risk viruses were located in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We show that HPV18 E2 protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the infected cells and that partial cytoplasmic localization of high risk E2 proteins correlates with induction of apoptosis through caspase 8 activation.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In contrast E2 proteins of low risk HPVs do not induce apoptosis due to their exclusive nuclear localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These experiments point to important differences in the biological functions of the E2 proteins from high and low risk papillomaviruses infecting the anogenital tract.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	103	 We infected HeLa cells at comparable m.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	104	 to get GFP fluorescence in virtually all the cells present on the plates.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	105	 As expected, GFP was observed in the nuclei of cells infected by the four recombinant adenoviruses expressing E2; however, cytoplasmic fluorescence was also clearly visible for the high risk HPV16 and HPV18 E2 (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Western blots analysis indicated that differences in the subcellular localization did not depend on differences in the levels of expression.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Notably, cytoplasmic localization of high risk HPV E2 proteins was not necessarily associated with higher levels of protein expression as shown with the HPV16 E2 protein (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In contrast, even when expressed to high levels, low risk HPV11 and HPV6 E2 proteins remain strictly nuclear (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Because HPV18 E2 has been shown to be particularly unstable (24), we compared the stability of the four E2 proteins in pulse-chase experiments (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	110	 These experiments showed that the HPV16 and HPV18 E2 proteins exhibit a similar half-life of 50 min, which exactly matches the half-life reported previously for HPV18 E2 (24).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In contrast the HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins appeared more stable, although their half-life times were only increased by 1.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	112	5-fold for HPV11 E2 (75 min) and by 2.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We concluded from these experiments that the exclusive nuclear localization of E2 proteins of the low risk viruses did not correlate with strong stabilization of the proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	114	We also checked whether all the E2 proteins were able to repress transcription of the viral oncogenes in HeLa cells, as previously reported (28 to 30).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	115	 It has been shown that this transcriptional repression induces p53 stabilization in HeLa cells due to E6 repression, consequently inducing a strong G1 growth arrest (28, 31).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The presence of p53 in cells expressing E2, but not in control cells, clearly indicated that the four proteins were equally able to stabilize nuclear p53 in infected cells (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	117	 1A) and to induce G1 growth arrest (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	118	 We also checked the transactivation and DNA binding properties of the four proteins and detected no significant differences (data not shown).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These experiments show that the GFP fusion proteins retain biological activity of the native proteins, as reported for the HPV18 E2 (24).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	120	High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis Because the four GFP-E2 fusion proteins appear to maintain their biological activity, we decided to compare their proapoptotic activities by infecting HeLa cells at increasing m.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	122	 We previously showed that induction of apoptosis requires a threshold expression level of the HPV18 E2 protein (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Indeed, apoptosis was clearly detectable in cells infected at higher m.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	128	 of HPV18 and HPV16 E2-expressing cells, in contrast to HPV6 and HPV11 E2-expressing cells, where this population remained under 10% (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Accumulation of the E2 proteins in infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	130	 These experiments indicated that the full-length HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins did not accumulate to high levels, partly due to the emergence of specific cleavage products and degradation with increasing m.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The cleavage products were inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD in vivo (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	132	 2D) and result from caspase 3 cleavages of the HPV18 and HPV16 GFP fusion proteins at cryptic sites, as shown by in vitro cleavage experiments (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	133	 These cleaved products are, thus, indicators of caspase activation and apoptosis in infected cells.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In contrast, full-length HPV6 and HPV11 E2 proteins accumulated to levels that were higher than the two other E2 proteins due to the absence of caspase cleavage (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	135	We checked whether stabilization of the GFP-E2 proteins of HPV18 or HPV11 would change the levels of apoptosis (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin induces an accumulation of the GFP-E2 proteins as shown in the lower panel of Fig.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Thus, we can conclude from this experiment that the stabilization of E2 does not seem to change the apoptotic phenotype whether the E2 protein is proapoptotic, like high risk HPV18 E2, or not, like low risk HPV11 E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	139	High Risk HPV E2 Proteins Induce Apoptosis via a Common Mechanism Involving Caspase 8 Activation in Different Cell Lines Clear differences in the behavior of the E2 proteins from high risk HPVs compared with low risk HPVs in inducing apoptosis was also demonstrated in other cell lines such as breast cancer MCF7 cells, containing a wild-type p53, and osteosarcoma Saos cells, which lack p53 (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We deduced from these experiments that the E2 proteins from low risk viruses are unable to induce high levels of apoptosis in conditions where E2 proteins from high risk viruses were efficient apoptotic inducers.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	141	We tested whether the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD could inhibit HPV16 as well as HPV18 E2-induced apoptosis as demonstrated before (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The addition of Z-VAD totally abolished the appearance of a sub-2N population (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These results suggested that the two viral proteins induced apoptosis through caspase 8 activation, as previously shown for HPV18 E2 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In living cells, caspase 8 exists as a full-length "proform" protein of 50/55 kDa (doublet).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	145	 This form of caspase is inactive and is activated by autocleavage to give rise to the active heterodimers, able to induce apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We examined cleaved products of caspase 8 in dead cells infected by recombinant adenoviruses expressing HPV18, HPV16, HPV11, and HPV6 GFP E2 proteins (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	147	 As expected from our previous data, HPV18 E2-expressing dead cells lost almost all caspase 8 proform and exhibited an intermediate cleaved product (40/36 kDa doublet).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Interestingly, exactly the same pattern was seen in HPV16 E2-expressing cells, indicating unambiguously that the two high risk HPV proteins induce apoptosis through the same pathway (Fig.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	205	 For this purpose, first we added a NLS in the hinge domain of the HPV18 E2 protein (18E2-insNLS2) by substituting two amino acids and inserting an arginine at position 250 to mimic the HPV11 E2 hinge NLS (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Second, we mutated the putative NLS of the amino-terminal domain of the GFP HPV11 E2 protein (11E2-mutNLS1) by changing two basic amino acids with the corresponding amino acids present in the HPV18 E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	207	 A third mutant was generated by changing two amino acids in the NLS of the hinge of HPV11 E2 (11E2-mutNLS2) (Fig.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	221	  The HPV18 E2 Protein Contains a NES in Its Amino-terminal Domain Previous unpublished data indicated that deletion of the amino-terminal domain of HPV 18 E2 resulted in a protein with increased nuclear accumulation.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	222	 These observations suggested that the HPV18 E2 protein could possess a NES in its amino-terminal domain (34, 35).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	223	 To address this, we generated deletions of the amino-terminal domain of the HPV18 E2 protein and fused the resultant polypeptides to GFP to study subcellular localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The E2-del53, lacking the first 53 aminoacids corresponding to the two first -helices, according to the published crystal structure (15, 16), clearly localizes differently from the full-length E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	225	 E2-del53 accumulates to high levels in the nucleus, displaying localization similar to the low risk HPV E2 proteins or HPV18 E2 protein lacking the entire amino-terminal domain.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Interestingly, deletion of only one -helix of the amino-terminal domain (E2-del26) had an extensive cytoplasmic localization similar to or even greater than the full-length protein (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We, thus, speculated that a NES could lie within the second -helix between residues 26 and 53 of the HPV18 E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Examining the sequences in this region, we found a cluster of about 20 amino acids that contains a putative consensus NES sequence (35 to 37) (Fig.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	239	 HeLa cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus expressing HPV18 GFP-E2 were treated with leptomycin B (LMB) 24 h post-infection and were subjected to video microscopy.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	240	  We fused the potential E2-NES to GFP containing the NLS of the HPV18 E2 DNA binding domain (24).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The addition of the putative NES sequence caused a strong delocalization of the nuclear GFP to the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	242	 5C), clearly indicating that this sequence is sufficient to promote nuclear export of a fused protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	243	 To further investigate the process of E2 nuclear export, we used leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1, which is one of the main exportins responsible for protein export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	244	 By time lapse microscopy, we found that the GFP-E2 18 protein accumulated in the nuclei of infected cells and almost completely disappeared from the cytoplasm after 4 h of treatment with leptomycin B (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These experiments strongly suggest that the HPV18 E2 is able to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via CRM1-dependent mechanism.

0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The two amino-terminal deleted HPV18 E2 proteins strikingly differ in their proapoptotic abilities; E2-del53, which is exclusively nuclear, did not induce apoptosis above background, whereas E2-del26, which is partly cytoplasmic, was a strong inducer of apoptosis (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These results led us to examine the behavior of the NLS point mutants described above.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We examined the level of apoptosis induced by the HPV18 E2 mutant that has been rendered more nuclear by the addition of the hinge NLS of HPV11 E2.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Our experiments indicated an intermediate phenotype between wild-type E2 and the amino-terminal deleted E2 protein that was difficult to quantify precisely in transfection experiments.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In contrast, the cytoplasmic NLS mutant HPV11 E2 protein could induce apoptosis, as measured by direct observation and annexin labeling, to higher levels compared with the HPV11 E2 wild-type protein (Fig.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We deduced from these experiments that differences in the induction of apoptosis between the two types of E2 proteins were not due to inherent differences in effector functions but, rather, to their different subcellular localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	261	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The roles of Papillomavirus E2 proteins in the viral life cycle have been studied extensively.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Human Papillomavirus E2 proteins exhibit a transactivation function whose role is not yet understood in the course of the viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In contrast, E2 function as a transcriptional repressor of the viral oncogenes and the specific disruption of the E2 gene during the establishment of HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis have been well documented.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	264	 E2 also activates viral DNA replication by interacting cooperatively with the viral helicase E1 at the origin of replication in the viral genome.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Apart from its functions in regulating transcription and viral DNA replication, E2 proteins also appear to be able to interact physically with cellular proteins to directly influence host cell biology.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	266	 One of these functions, not linked to transactivation, is the induction of apoptosis, which has been shown to occur through induction of the extrinsic death pathway and activation of caspase 8 (19).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	267	 We have also shown that this apoptosis is independent of p53 and can occur in many different cell types provided that the viral protein is expressed above a certain threshold.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	268	 This activity has also been described for the HPV16 E2 protein, although it was reported that induction of apoptosis required p53 activation (20).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Nothing was known about the propapoptotic functions of other E2 proteins, particularly for the E2 proteins from other human papillomaviruses involved in benign infections of the anogenital tract such as the low risk HPV types 6 and 11.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	270	One of the most notable differences between the E2 proteins of the two types of HPV viruses was their subcellular localization.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Although the HPV11 and HPV6 E2 proteins were exclusively nuclear in many cell types tested, the HPV16 and HPV18 proteins were also found in the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	272	 We could show that these differences in behavior were due to the fact that a dominant functional NLS was present in the hinge domain of the HPV11 E2 protein (33) and absent from the HPV18 and HPV16 E2 proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In addition, we showed that HPV18 E2 contains an NES in its amino-terminal domain that is responsible for active export of the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (that was repressed by leptomycin B).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Furthermore, inactivating point mutations of the strong NLS of HPV11 E2 protein lead to a clear delocalization of the protein to the cytoplasm of transfected cells, indicating that this NLS is sufficient to explain the strict nuclear localization of the full-length proteins.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In contrast, more complex phenomena probably dictate the localization of the HPV18 E2 as none of the NLSs appeared sufficient to induce nuclear retention.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In contrast, a NES is able to delocalize the protein to the cytoplasm, so the subcellular localization of the protein seems to be tightly regulated by a complex interplay of signals and active nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	277	As transcription and replication factors, E2 proteins should be primarily expressed in the nuclei of infected cells during the normal viral life cycle.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Other functions of the high risk virus E2 proteins could account for their cytoplasmic localization, and we have shown that their proapoptotic activity could be one of them.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	279	 There are clear differences between the E2 proteins of the high risk or low risk viruses in inducing apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Although E2 proteins from both high risk viruses were able to induce apoptosis at equivalent rates in different cell types, the E2 proteins from low risk viruses were unable to do so.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Caspase 8 activation could be detected in both HPV16- and HPV18 E2-expressing cells, indicating that the mechanism of apoptotic cell death was probably conserved between these two viruses.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In addition, using mutants of the E2 proteins, we could show that apoptosis is linked to the cytoplasmic expression of E2, linking apoptosis to the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling rather than to inherent properties of the E2 protein.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	283	There are several other viral proteins that have been shown to activate apoptosis of infected cells through various mechanisms (for review, see Refs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	284	 38 to 40), although the exact role of this specific function in the viral life cycle is generally not fully understood.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Among these viral proteins, there are some that have been shown to induce apoptosis through caspase 8 activation, such as the lyssavirus matrix protein (41), the NS3 protein of hepatitis C (42), or HBx of hepatitis B.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	286	 HBx, among various pleiotropic functions, is a transcription factor that is expressed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of infected cells.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The cytoplasmic HBx protein can activate caspase 8 by repressing c-FLIP through direct protein interaction, rendering the cells hypersensitive to tumor necrosis- apoptotic activation (43).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of proteins is a frequent event accompanying induction of apoptosis.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Many apoptotic proteins have to be expressed in a specific cellular compartment to be efficient and probably to allow direct protein-protein interactions.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Examples of viral proapototic proteins, which are expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of infected cells, are apoptin, the viral protein associated with chicken anemia and E4orf4 of adenovirus.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Contrary to E2, apoptin has to be expressed in the nucleus to exert its proapoptotic function (44).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In contrast, E4orf4 exerted its proapoptotic activity by two distinct pathways, one in the nucleus and the other in the cytoplasm (45).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Caspase 8 activation occurs via the extrinsic death pathway as a consequence of the activation of the death-inducing signal complex through death receptors at the cytoplasmic membrane (46).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Because E2 is an intracellular protein, caspase activation might occur within the cytoplasm by direct action on the proteins of the death-inducing signal complex or directly on caspase 8 itself.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	295	 We do not yet know the exact mechanism by which E2 activates apoptosis, but it is clearly due to direct interactions of E2 with cytoplasmic substructures containing activated caspase 8 (results not shown).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	296	Why might viruses induce apoptosis of the infected cells? A plethora of viral proteins inducing apoptosis has been described indicating that the proapoptotic functions play a universal role during the viral life cycle (for review, see Refs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	297	 One possibility is that apoptosis might help the newly created particles at the end of the viral life cycle to escape from the host cell and spread out.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	298	 This hypothesis, however, raises the question of why this function is not conserved in low risk HPVs.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	299	 There are at least two possibilities.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	300	 First, the low risk E2 proteins could be more efficient in inducing apoptosis in a more physiological situation, in co-expression with other viral proteins, for instance, that could help E2 to shuttle to the cytoplasm.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This is a particularly attractive hypothesis, since we have shown that the low risk HPV E2 proteins can induce apoptosis if they are artificially directed to the cytoplasm of infected cells.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Another possibility is that this function is expressed by another viral protein, such as E4 for instance, which is a viral protein expressed at later time points in the viral cycle and which has been shown to induce apoptosis (48).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	303	 An alternative hypothesis is that E6 and E7 proteins of high risk HPVs modify the cell cycle and block cellular differentiation.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	304	 These modifications of the host cell biology might induce a greater resistance to apoptosis, specifically with the reduction of p53 expression (49).
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The proapoptotic activity of the high risk E2 proteins would be required to overcome these effects, contrary to the low risk infected cells, where many of the E6 and E7 functions are not conserved.
0.2730276.16135518.html.plaintext.txt	306	 The proapoptotic activity of high risk E2 proteins, however, could explain why the high risk viral genomes integrated into the cellular DNA preferentially with disruption of the E2 ORF, with this disruption leading to higher transcription of the E6 and E7 oncogenes and carcinogenic progression.

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	5	 This paper describes the isolation of two distinct homologous sets of all three HBL components from a single B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The proteins of one set (designated HBL, consisting of B, L1 and L2), were about 87 to 100% identical in N-terminal amino acid sequences to their respective prototype components from strain F837/76, and the proteins of the homologous set (HBLa, consisting of Ba, L1a and L2a) were all about 62 to 65% identical.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Only the latter homologues differed immunochemically and physicochemically from the prototypes.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HBL and HBLa exhibited similar haemolytic and vascular permeability potencies, and the homologues could be interchanged freely.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	9	 There were no notable differences in activity between the L component homologues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, components B and Ba were significantly different.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both were secreted as monomers, but unlike B, Ba was isolated as a relatively inactive complex that could be reactivated with urea.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	12	 When Ba was substituted for B in gel-diffusion assays the distinct discontinuous haemolysis pattern typical of the presence of B did not occur.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In suspension assays, excess B inhibited the haemolysis of B-primed cells by L1 (as previously described), but not that of Ba-primed cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Excess Ba had the opposite effect and enhanced lysis of Ba-primed cells, but not that of B-primed cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These differences reveal details about how the toxin components interact on target cell membranes.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The authors  observations indicate that HBL represents a new family of multicomponent toxins that was generated by a process of gene and operon duplication that occurred either intracellularly or by horizontal transfer, and raise the possibility of the existence of other related toxins in the genetically diverse B.

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Among the many potential virulence factors of B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	21	 cereus is haemolysin BL (HBL), a unique and potent three-component pore-forming toxin (Beecher  and  Macmillan, 1991 ; Beecher  and  Wong, 1994c ; Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The toxic activities so far identified for HBL include haemolysis, vascular permeability and necrosis in rabbit skin (Beecher  and  Macmillan, 1991 ; Beecher  and  Wong, 1994c ), fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops (Beecher et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	23	, 1995b ), toxicity to a number of transformed cell lines (Beecher, 1990 ), in vitro degradation of explanted rabbit retinal tissue, and in vivo ocular necrosis and inflammation in rabbits (Beecher et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	24	 HBL is secreted by 45% of over 200 B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	25	 mycoides isolates tested in our laboratory (Beecher  and  Wong, 1994b ; Schoeni  and  Wong, 1999 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A distinctive feature of HBL is an unusual discontinuous haemolysis pattern produced in blood agar (Beecher  and  Macmillan, 1991 ; Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	27	 When HBL diffuses from a bacterial colony or a well in blood agar, lysis begins away from the well or colony, followed by slow lysis nearer the source.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	28	 cereus strain F837/76, the three HBL components are encoded in an operon by tandemly arranged genes in the order hblC, hblD and hblA, which respectively encode components designated L2, L1 and B (Heinrichs et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Immediately downstream from hblA is an open reading frame, hblB, which is about 85% identical to hblA in the first 158 predicted amino acids.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The hblB gene product has not yet been isolated.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	31	Many isolates in our Bacillus collection produce more than one antigen reactive to antibodies against individual HBL components (Schoeni  and  Wong, 1999 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For example, on Western blots of denaturing electrophoresis gels B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	33	 cereus MGBC 145 produces two bands reactive with antibodies to HBL components B and L1, and one band reactive with antibodies to component L2.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This strain is used in studies of experimental endophthalmitis in our laboratory and in others (Beecher et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Because the production of multiple toxin homologues might confound efforts to characterize the molecular basis of B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	36	 cereus virulence in intraocular infections, we decided to characterize the antigens responsible for producing multiple bands on Western blots.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We isolated and characterized two distinct homologous variants of each HBL component from a single B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	38	 cereus strain, demonstrating that the variant antigens are distinct gene products.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The activities of the variants were essentially the same as the prototype components, the homologues were interchangeable, and the requirement for three components to produce activity was maintained.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A homologue of one component possessed several important differences in the details of its activity that elucidate some of its interactions with other components on erythrocyte membranes.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	41	   METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Bacterial isolates.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	42	 cereus strain MGBC 145 was used as the source of HBL homologues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This strain was isolated from the infected eye of a patient with post-traumatic endophthalmitis (Beecher et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	44	 cereus strain F837/76, an isolate from an infected prostate, was used as the source of prototype HBL components in the present study.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This isolate was originally chosen as the source of HBL because it is exceptionally toxigenic (Beecher  and  Macmillan, 1990 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	46	Production of crude haemolysin BL.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	47	 cereus isolates were grown at 32  degrees C for 5 h in 3 litres of casein/glucose/yeast extract broth with shaking at 200 r.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The culture supernatants were each concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation to 50 ml.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The concentrates were used as sources of crude HBL.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The culture medium, growth conditions and concentration procedure are described in detail elsewhere (Beecher  and  Wong, 1994c ).

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	52	) of purification steps involving anion-exchange (Whatman DE-52 and Pharmacia Mono-Q) and hydroxyapatite (HA) chromatography were as previously described (Beecher  and  Wong, 1994c ) with the following exceptions.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The pH 5 9 Bistris anion-exchange equilibration buffer was 20 mM instead of 25 mM, and the HA was Macro-Prep ceramic HA (20  microm beads, Bio-Rad) instead of BioGel HTP.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Salt concentrations of fractions were estimated assuming that the gradients were linear and began eluting one column volume after they were started.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Column volumes were estimated empirically by changes in the apparent absorbance of eluate after abrupt changes in salt concentration.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	56	Three additional chromatographic steps were used.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	57	 First, rather than dialysis, buffer exchange of the concentrated culture supernatant was by gel-filtration chromatography on a 2 6x78 cm column of medium-grade Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM Bistris/HCl, pH 5 9, and eluted at a flow rate of 7 5 ml min-1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Second, for final isolation of the L1a component (see below for nomenclature), fractions from the pH 5 9 Mono-Q column were dialysed against 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7 4, and applied to the Mono-Q column equilibrated with the same buffer.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0 5 M over 50 ml at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Third, for isolation of the L2a the nonbound DE-52 fraction containing L2a was applied to a 1 ml (0 5x5 cm) HA column (as compared to the 1 6x8 cm column usually used) equilibrated with 10 mM NaCl and eluted at 1 ml min-1 with a linear gradient of sodium phosphate from 0 to 0 3 M over 30 ml and collected into 1 ml fractions.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Concentrations of purified proteins were routinely determined by measuring A280 using previously estimated absorption coefficients (1 mg ml-1) of 1 3, 1 8 and 0 8 for B, L1 and L2 (from strain F837/76) respectively.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Initial experiments suggested that the absorption coefficients of B and Ba may differ significantly.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Thus, when homologue doses were to be compared, concentrations were measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Chemical Co.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	64	) in which components from strain F837/76 were used as concentration standards for their respective homologues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The BCA assay measures primarily peptide bonds rather than aromatic amino acid residues, thus decreasing protein-to-protein variation.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	66	Assay for HBL components and sphingomyelinase.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	67	 HBL components and sphingomyelinase were identified in chromatography fractions immunochemically with dot blots.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The different B and L1 homologues were distinguished from one another by their different apparent molecular masses on Western blots.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The L2 homologues were identical in size, but could be distinguished by their widely different chromatographic behaviour.

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The Pharmacia LMW Marker Kit was used for size standards (phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase and lactalbumin).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	77	Proteins resolved in SDS and native PAGE gels were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) in a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 V, constant voltage, for 1 h or 1 25 h, respectively.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Isoelectric points were determined on a PhastSystem (Pharmacia) using Pharmacia IEF standards and Phastgel IEF gels with pH ranges of 3 to 9 and 4 to 6 5.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	79	 All gels were run at 2000 V, 2 mA, 3 5 W for 75 V h prior to loading samples and at 200 V, 2 mA, 3 5 W for 15 V h during sample loading.

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	227	) lysis by 0 5 to 10 nM of the L components was rapid and complete (data not shown).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	228	 L1a appeared to be about half as potent as L1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, minor concentration inaccuracies cannot yet be ruled out.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	230	 There were no apparent differences in activities between L2 and L2a.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	231	Haemolysis by HBL and HBLa components: differences Haemolysis in blood agar.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	232	 When B was present the discontinuous haemolysis pattern typical of HBL occurred for all L component combinations (i.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	233	 L1+2, L1+2a, L1a+2 and L1a+2a).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This suggests that the L1 and L1a components interact in similar ways with the B component to produce the pattern (L2 neither inhibits B or L1, nor is it inhibited by them and thus does not contribute to the discontinuous pattern: Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	235	 However, when Ba replaced B, the discontinuous pattern did not occur for any L combination, i.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	236	 lysis was continuous from the well edge to the edge of the lysis zone.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	237	 4 shows the effect of varying the concentration of L1 on the haemolysis pattern in the presence of B or Ba (L1a produced the same effects in blood agar; not shown).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The discontinuous pattern occurred at all L1 concentrations in the presence of B, but lysis occurred more quickly near the well at lower L1 concentrations, which appear nearly continuous in the figure.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	239	 A discontinuous pattern was not evident at any time around the wells containing Ba.

0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Wells in columns received L1 at the concentrations indicated at the bottom.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	244	 All four horizontal strips were on the same blood agar gel.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The image was recorded after 6 h at 25  degrees C.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	246	 4 also indicates that 8 M urea significantly enhanced the activity of Ba, but quantitation of the enhancement was not possible because of the inhibitory effects of excess L1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The relative potencies of B and Ba in blood agar were estimated by placing serial dilutions of each in wells surrounding a central well containing 100 ng L1+2.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In this method B primes cells surrounding the well without the inhibitory effect of excess L1 (Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The lowest amounts of B, Ba and Ba+8 M urea exhibiting lytic activity were 0 3, 4 and 1 25 ng per well respectively.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	250	Inhibition of L1 components by B and Ba.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Just as excess L1 inhibits the priming reaction of B to produce discontinuous haemolysis on blood agar, it also inhibits priming in erythrocyte suspensions (Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Likewise, the addition of excess B to previously primed erythrocytes inhibits the lysis rate of L1 (Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	253	 We examined the abilities of excess B and Ba components to inhibit the lysis of B- and Ba-primed cells by L1 (preliminary experiments indicated that there were no discernible differences between L1 and L1a components; therefore only results using L1 are shown).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The results are shown in Table 2.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Effect of excess B, Ba or 2Ba on erythrocyte lysis by components L1+2.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	256	  Sheep erythrocytes were primed at 42  degrees C with 5 nM B or 10 nM Ba.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The primed erythrocytes were lysed with 5 nM L1+2 in the presence or absence of 25 nM B or Ba.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The Ba was added either in 8 M urea to test the monomer, or only in buffer to test the complex (2Ba).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Final urea concentrations in samples and controls are described in Methods.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	260	There were striking differences between the effects of excess B and excess Ba on the lysis rate produced by L1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	261	 As expected, excess B inhibited the lysis of B-primed cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	262	 However, excess Ba actually enhanced haemolysis of Ba-primed cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Neither excess B nor excess Ba significantly affected the lysis rate of cells primed by the other protein.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Complexed Ba (2Ba in Table 2) did not significantly affect lysis of cells primed by either B or Ba.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	265	Most proteins unfold in 8 M urea, and it was possible that the enhanced activity of urea-treated Ba was due to the unfolding and refolding of Ba rather than dissolution of the complex per se.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	266	 When B, which was already in monomer form, was first dissolved in 8 M urea, its inhibition of lysis differed by less than 10 % compared to untreated B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This suggests that urea had little effect on the monomer.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	268	Vascular permeability activity of HBL and HBLa The ability of the HBL and HBLa components to cause vascular permeability and necrosis in rabbit skin was tested using combinations that appeared likely to be active based on their haemolytic characteristics.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Samples containing 0 5 to 1 5  microg of single components and binary combinations produced no reaction.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	270	 There were no clear differences between samples containing 0 5  microg of each component of HBL from F837/76, or HBL and HBLa from MGBC 145, which produced respectively 20 plus or minus 1 6, 21 plus or minus 1 2 and 20 plus or minus 2 0 mm of bluing and 3 7 plus or minus 2 5, 4 4 plus or minus 3 7 and 4 0 plus or minus 1 2 mm of necrosis (means plus or minus SD, n=3).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Similar reactions were obtained when Ba was mixed with L1+2 and when B(F) was mixed with L1a+2a.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	272	 When B and Ba concentrations were varied with constant L1+2, necrosis occurred with 0 5  microg of B and Ba, but not with 0 25 and 0 125  microg.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The only difference appeared in the bluing response between 0 125  microg of B and 0 125  microg of Ba, which produced 23 plus or minus 0 5 and 9 plus or minus 2 6 mm zones respectively.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	274	Ba was not treated with urea prior to vascular permeability testing to avoid any complications that high concentrations of urea might produce.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	275	 This component will be further characterized when conditions are developed to produce significant concentrations of Ba monomer in physiological salt concentrations.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	276	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We have noted that numerous B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	277	 cereus strains produce multiple bands on Western blots probed with antibodies specific for components of HBL.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The presence of multiple toxin homlogues might complicate attempts to understand virulence mechanisms.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Therefore, we tried to determine whether the different bands seen on Western blots represent distinct gene products.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Using antibodies to track the chromatographic behaviour of the different forms of the HBL components, we isolated two distinct homologues of each component from the medically important B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Both sets of homologues, HBL and HBLa, were haemolytic, dermonecrotic, and caused vascular permeability in rabbit skin with similar potencies.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Overall, there were no discernible differences in activity between the L homologues, but there were significant differences in activity between B and Ba.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	283	The homologous components differed from one another in size, net charge and chromatographic behaviour.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	284	 L1 and L1a behaved most similarly, and L1a coeluted with sphingomyelinase from HA and from anion-exchangers at pH 5 9.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, it could be separated from sphingomyelinase at pH 7 4.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	286	 L2 and L2a were essentially identical in size, but because they differed in pI by a full pH unit, they were readily separated by ion-exchange chromatography, and the exceptionally late elution of L2a from HA made it easy to isolate in as few as two chromatographic steps.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	287	 It was isolated as a complex, which may explain its incongruous chromatographic elution.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Its apparent pI was 6 0 (Table 1), and one would expect that it would elute earlier from anion-exchange columns than B (pI 5 3).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Instead, it eluted later, at 1 3 times the elution volume of B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The heat-generated complexes of B (upper bands, Fig.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	291	 3a, lane B65) behave in the same way (data to be published elsewhere).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	292	 It appears, however, that Ba is naturally produced as a monomer, which is how it appeared in fresh B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	293	 cereus culture supernatant (Fig.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	294	 We are investigating the factors that result in complex formation during purification.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	295	All of the  a  components were 62 to 65% identical to their respective homologues over 30 to 43 residues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Similar identity (60%) in strain F837/76 between the N-termini of B and the predicted hblB sequence rises to approximately 85% over the first 158 residues (Heinrichs et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	297	, 1993 ), suggesting that the HBLa components may prove to be more closely related to HBL components than indicated by the N-termini.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The high sequence similarity among the  a  homologues suggests that the three genes may have been either simultaneously duplicated or simultaneously transferred horizontally, and this would have been facilitated by their tandem arrangement in an operon (Ryan et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We have also determined that the four hbl genes in strain F837/76 all arose via duplication of a single gene (Beecher, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Note that HBL has been mapped to a portion of the B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	301	 cereus chromosome that exhibits exceptional variability compared with other regions, and that this variable region is sometimes located on large extrachromosomal DNA fragments that appear to be stable, but might also prove to be large mobile plasmids (Carlson et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	302	, 1996a , b ; Carlson  and  Kolsto, 1994 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	303	 This raises fundamental questions about the extent and role of gene duplication and horizontal transfer in the evolution of B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	304	In addition to HBL and HBLa, we have found (data not shown) that strain MGBC 145 expresses another homologous three-component toxin designated nonhaemolytic enterotoxin (NHE) by Lund  and  Granum (1996) .
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Data from several studies suggest that, among strains that express either HBL or NHE, 80% of them express both (Buchanan  and  Schultz, 1994 ; Day et al.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	306	, 1994 ; Rusul  and  Yaacob, 1995 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	307	 These data are based on detection of the L2 protein of HBL, or the NHEA protein, by two commercial kits (Beecher  and  Wong, 1994a ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	308	Our observations highlight practical problems both for the diagnosis of toxigenic strains and for the identification of B.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	309	 cereus virulence factors, particularly since there may be additional unidentified HBL homologues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Since the discontinuous haemolysis pattern typical of HBL appears to be produced only in the presence of the prototype B component, discontinuous lysis around colonies or culture supernatants (Beecher  and  Wong, 1994b ) now appears to be of limited diagnostic value.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	311	 For maximum value, other methods should detect all relevant toxin components or component combinations.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	312	 However, not all of these components and combinations are completely defined.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In attempts to identify virulence factors, possible contributions from multiple, potentially interacting, multicomponent toxins must be kept in mind.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	314	Although numerous physical phenomena have been documented for HBL, little is known about how the components interact at the molecular level beyond the fact that the they bind to cells independently and must physically interact to form pores.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	315	 It is also clear that there is a change in the physical state of B between its initial association with the membrane (Bm) and its primed state (B').
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	316	 This change may involve conformational changes, oligomerization, membrane insertion, or all three.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The experiment represented in Table 2 provides some insight into such additional interactions as discussed below.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	318	We previously found that the lysis of B-primed erythrocytes by L1+2 was inhibited by excess B added simultaneously with the L components, and that it is L1 that is inhibited, not L2 (Beecher  and  Wong, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Table 2 shows that excess B and Ba have different effects, and that the specific effect depends on which was used to prime the cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	320	 A significant effect occurred only when the protein added in excess was the same as that used to prime cells.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	321	 This indicates that the excess Bm must physically interact with B' (likewise for excess and Ba'), and that B and Ba are sufficiently unrelated that they do not interact with one another.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	322	The excess B may inhibit lysis simply by obstructing L1 from contact with B', or by producing inefficient lytic complexes composed of Bm, B' and L1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Enhancement of lysis by Ba was unexpected, and the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	324	 It might occur either if enhances the incorporation of L1 into the lesion, or if  to Ba' to L1 complexes are more efficient than Ba' to L1 complexes.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	325	There is a structural basis for suggesting that L1 binds more efficiently to  to Ba' complexes.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	326	 B and L1 from strain F837/76 appear to be distant homologues, and the most significant structural difference between them is that B is missing 40 residues of a 60-residue apparent transmembrane segment present in L1 (Beecher, 1997 ).
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The observed size difference of approximately 4 4 kDa between B and Ba (Table 1) equates with a difference of approximately 40 residues.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	328	 In essence, Ba may act as a hybrid between B and L1 by virtue of retaining the full transmembrane segment that is characteristic of L1.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	329	While our observations emphasize practical difficulties for diagnosis and identification of virulence factors, they also provide promising opportunities for structure to function analysis of the HBL family of toxins.
0.1914435.10846215.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The structural and functional differences between B and Ba are significant and may provide insight into the mechanism of HBL toxicity as well as an explanation for the unique haemolytic phenomena of this toxin.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Development of strategies to prevent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection requires knowledge of cellular pathways harnessed by the virus for invasion.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This study demonstrates that HSV induces rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in several human target cells and that phosphorylation is important for entry post-binding.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore, and downstream events (including expression of immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation) were substantially reduced in cells transfected with dominant-negative mutants of FAK or small interfering RNA designed to inhibit FAK expression.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These observations were substantiated using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from embryonic FAK-deficient mice.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Infection was reduced by  > 90% in knockout cells relative to control cells and was further reduced if the knockout cells were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2, which was also phosphorylated in response to HSV.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The knockout cells were permissive for viral binding, and virus triggered an intracellular calcium response, but nuclear transport was inhibited.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Together, these results support a novel model for invasion that implicates FAK phosphorylation as important for delivery of viral capsids to the nuclear pore.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 type 2 is a major global health problem, the leading cause of genital herpes and neonatal herpes encephalitis, and a major cofactor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Novel strategies to prevent HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted infections are urgently needed.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Development of new approaches requires an understanding of the molecular and cellular events critical for the establishment of infection.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Previous work demonstrates that HSV entry is a complex process requiring the following steps: (i) binding to heparan sulfate receptors; (ii) engagement of glycoprotein D coreceptors; (iii) penetration, which, for human epithelial cells, is mediated primarily by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane; (iv) transport of the viral tegument protein VP16 (trans-inducing factor (TIF)) to the nucleus; and (v) transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore with release of viral DNA into the nucleoplasm (1, 2).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Glycoprotein B plays the major role in mediating binding of HSV-2 to heparan sulfate receptors, whereas glycoprotein C plays a more dominant role in mediating binding of HSV-1 (3, 4).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	15	 For both serotypes, glycoproteins B, D, and H-L are required for penetration, but their precise role and the cellular pathways important for viral invasion have not been fully elucidated.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The observations that heparan sulfate is the major attachment receptor for HSV and that heparan sulfate moieties also interact with gp120 of HIV fostered the development of sulfated or sulfonated polymers as candidate topical microbicides to prevent viral transmission.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These compounds prevent genital herpes in the mouse and simian immunodeficiency virus in the macaque and are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials (5, 6).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, competitive antagonists of viral binding are not likely to be sufficient to fully protect against sexual transmission.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Experience with systemic therapy indicates that combination therapies that target more than one step in the viral life cycle are optimal.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, elucidating the cellular pathways required for viral entry may provide novel targets for microbicide development.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	21	We reported previously that both serotypes of HSV trigger inositol triphosphate-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and that Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in viral entry (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Pharmacological inhibition of ER Ca2+ release or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduces nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, a surrogate marker for capsid transport, and the downstream events in the viral life cycle, including expression of viral immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Activation of Ca2+ signaling is associated with triggering of phosphorylation signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Specifically, we observed previously that HSV-1 and HSV-2 trigger the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within 5-10 min following exposure of Vero (monkey kidney) or CaSki (human cervical epithelial) cells to virus.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	25	 FAK phosphorylation appears to occur downstream of release of ER Ca2+ stores, as treatment of cells with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol triphosphate receptor antagonist that prevents release of ER Ca2+, or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ blocks the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Activation of both pathways (Ca2+ and FAK phosphorylation) requires exposure to entry-competent virus, as HSV-1 deleted in the glycoproteins essential for penetration (glycoproteins B, D, and H-L) fails to induce Ca2+ release or to trigger FAK phosphorylation, whereas Ca2+ release and phosphorylation are preserved following exposure to the repaired viruses and to inactivated virus, which retain the ability to penetrate cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These findings led to the proposal of a new paradigm for HSV entry in which HSV triggers inositol triphosphate-mediated release of ER Ca2+ stores, which may facilitate fusion of the viral envelope and cell membrane, allowing delivery of capsids to the cytoplasm (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In response to activation of the Ca2+ pathways, we hypothesize that FAK and related signaling pathways are activated, which may promote transport of the viral capsids to the nuclear pores.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This study was designed to test this hypothesis and to evaluate whether HSV exploits FAK signaling pathways to promote its nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We used complementary molecular techniques, including dominant-negative variants, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and knockout cells, to explore the role played by FAK in HSV invasion.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We tested the hypothesis with both serotypes using human and murine cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Our findings indicate that FAK phosphorylation plays a central role in promoting transport of viral capsids.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	242	 To further address the independence of Pyk2 and FAK phosphorylation, we again took advantage of siRNA strategy.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	243	 CaSki cells were transfected with control nonspecific siRNA or with Pyk2- or FAK-specific siRNA and then mock-infected or infected with HSV-2(G).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Transfection with Pyk2-specific siRNA led to an 70% reduction in Pyk2 expression and virus-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In contrast, virus-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation was preserved in cells transfected with FAK-specific siRNA (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	246	 9B, middle panels), and virus-induced FAK phosphorylation was preserved in cells transfected with Pyk2-specific siRNA (lower panels, which show results with FAK+/+ cells; similar results were obtained with CaSki cells).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	247	To evaluate whether Pyk2 phosphorylation contributes to HSV infection, plaque assays were conducted in cells transfected with siRNA specific for FAK or Pyk2 alone and in combination.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Compared with cells transfected with control nonspecific siRNA, HSV-2 infection was inhibited by 74  plus or minus  6, 60  plus or minus  5, and 94  plus or minus  7% in CaSki cells transfected with siRNA for FAK, Pyk2, or both, respectively (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Consistent with the low level of Pyk2 phosphorylation observed in FAK+/+ cells (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	250	 9A), transfection of these cells with Pyk2-specific siRNA had little inhibitory effect (22%), whereas transfection with FAK-specific siRNA reduced viral infection by 71%.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In contrast, transfection of FAK-/- cells with Pyk2-specific siRNA further reduced viral infection by  > 99%.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	252	 To directly evaluate whether Pyk2 phosphorylation also contributes to nuclear transport, CaSki cells were transfected with nonspecific or Pyk2-specific siRNA, and the effects on viral binding and VP16 transport to the nucleus were evaluated.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Transfection with Pyk2-specific siRNA had no effect on viral binding (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	254	 10B), but had a modest inhibitory effect on nuclear transport of VP16 (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Optical densitometry scanning of the gels demonstrated an 40% reduction in nuclear VP16 following Pyk2-specific siRNA transfection, consistent with the modest inhibition of viral plaque formation (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Similarly, transfection with Pyk2-specific siRNA also had a moderate effect on delivery of GFP to the nuclear pore as detected by confocal microscopy (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Together, these results suggest that HSV induces phosphorylation of Pyk2 independent of phosphorylation of FAK and that, although FAK plays the predominant role, activation of both kinases contributes to viral infection.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	265	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The dependence of viruses on host cell machinery for transcription, translation, and genome replication is well established.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	266	 However, viruses presumably also must harness host cell pathways for entry and egress (16).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The results obtained in this study demonstrate for the first time that HSV triggers phosphorylation of the cellular kinases FAK and Pyk2 to promote successful invasion.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	268	 HSV independently induces phosphorylation of FAK and Pyk2, and disruption of these pathways impedes delivery of the tegument protein VP16 to the nucleus and delivery of capsids to the nuclear pore, leading to a reduction in downstream events (viral gene expression and plaque formation).

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The results are representative of three independent experiments.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	276	  Several studies suggest that HSV uses microtubule-based transport to delivery viral capsids to the nuclear pore, where viral DNA is released into the nucleus (1, 17-19).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV-1 capsids co-localize with dynein and dynactin.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Microtubule-depolymerizing agents, such as nocodazole, block HSV infection in culture and in animal models (1).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Moreover, nuclear transport of capsids is reduced by dynein inhibitors (19).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Precisely how HSV (or other viruses) engages and regulates the microtubule complexes is not known.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	281	 It has been suggested that cellular kinases triggered by viral infection or perhaps encoded by viruses themselves may play this regulatory role.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The results obtained in this study support this notion and suggest that cellular FAK and the related tyrosine kinase Pyk2 are activated by HSV to promote transport along microtubules.

0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	295	  FAK was originally identified as a tyrosine kinase localized to focal adhesions, which are multiprotein structures that link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton through integrin receptors.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	296	 More recent studies indicate that FAK also participates in the regulation of microtubule function.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	297	 For example, integrin-mediated activation of FAK is required for microtubule stabilization in mouse fibroblasts (20).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Additionally, FAK phosphorylation at Ser732 is important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and neuronal migration (21).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The latter study suggests that FAK phosphorylation regulates microtubule-based nuclear translocation and neuronal migration.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Pyk2 (also called FAK2) belongs to the same family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases as does FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In contrast to FAK, which is expressed ubiquitously, Pyk2 expression is more restricted, but is found in hematopoietic, neuronal, and epithelial cells.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Pyk2 shares substantial homology with FAK and interacts with intracellular signaling molecules to activate a variety of cellular pathways, including regulation of microtubules (15).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Notably, increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels are associated with Pyk2 phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	304	 We found that HSV also induces Pyk2 phosphorylation independent of FAK.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Pyk2 phosphorylation was most evident in FAK-/- fibroblasts, which are known to overexpress Pyk2 (15), and also contributed to viral infection post-binding.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Thus, the observation that HSV capsid nuclear transport occurs via microtubules and the association of FAK and Pyk2 with microtubule regulation suggest that HSV triggers these cellular kinases to harness the microtubule machinery for its nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	307	Several viruses activate FAK or related signaling pathways, but the precise role played by these pathways in viral invasion or pathogenicity has not been delineated previously.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	308	 FAK is activated by integrin binding and aggregation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Thus, viruses that bind integrin receptors, such as adenovirus and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), trigger FAK phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Adenovirus induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK within 15 min following infection of human corneal fibroblasts, but its role in viral pathogenicity is not known (22).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	311	 HHV-8 glycoprotein B, which possesses an RGD motif, binds to integrin receptors on target cells and triggers rapid phosphorylation of FAK and related signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The finding that HHV-8 infection of FAK-null cells is substantially reduced suggests that FAK may also be required for HHV-8 entry, but this has not yet been experimentally demonstrated (23-25).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Additionally, binding of HIV gp120 to T cells also triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (26), which may promote apoptosis (27), but has not yet been demonstrated to play any role in HIV entry or nuclear transport.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	314	It is not clear yet how HSV activates the FAK cell signaling pathway.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Although glycoprotein B is highly conserved among herpesviruses, only HHV-8 glycoprotein B possesses the RGD motif and interacts with integrin molecules as a receptor (28).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Recent studies demonstrate that HSV-1 glycoprotein H binds to v3 integrins; however; the functional significance of this interaction is unclear (29).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	317	 A recombinant virus with the RGD motif in glycoprotein H mutated to RGE shows no impairment in entry or infectivity in vitro (30) and also induces FAK phosphorylation.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	318	The results from our study suggest that FAK phosphorylation occurs downstream of Ca2+ signaling and is triggered either directly by the increase in [Ca2+]i or in response to Ca2+-dependent viral penetration.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	319	 This notion is supported by the findings that HSV induces an increase in [Ca2+]i in FAK-/- cells (Fig.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	320	 9) and that treatment of cells with pharmacological agents that block release of ER Ca2+ stores or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ prevents the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	321	 In contrast to what has been observed for HHV-8 glycoprotein B or HIV gp120, no single HSV glycoprotein-cell interaction appears to be sufficient to activate the requisite cell signaling pathways.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Our studies with deletion viruses indicate that penetration-competent virus is required to induce signaling.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	323	 This follows from the observations that HSV-1 deleted in glycoprotein L or glycoprotein D, both of which bind but do not penetrate, fails to induce the signaling responses, whereas heat-inactivated virus induces phosphorylated FAK (7).
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Possibly, one of the HSV envelope glycoproteins interacts with a cell-surface receptor to trigger the signaling cascade, but the interaction is dependent on the other glycoproteins being present in the viral envelope.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This could occur if, for example, the other glycoproteins induce a conformational change in and/or recruit the requisite glycoprotein(s) to a specific site at the membrane.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	326	Defining precisely how HSV triggers the signaling pathways is critical, as the viral proteins involved are excellent candidate targets for antiviral therapies.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Although targeting critical cellular pathways such as FAK phosphorylation will undoubtedly have pleiotropic and potentially deleterious effects as suggested by the reduction in magnitude of virus-induced Ca2+ transients in FAK-/- cells and the observed changes in morphology of FAK knockout cells (15), targeting the viral proteins that activate the requisite signaling pathways should lead to the development of novel specific antiviral therapies.
0.15668444.15994312.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The results from this study provide an important piece to the puzzle and suggest that blockade of HSV-triggered phosphorylation of FAK and, to a lesser extent, Pyk2 will prevent nuclear transport, a critical step in the establishment of HSV infection.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Oligonucleotides encoding the epitope were cloned into several hypervariable regions of the L1 ORF of the HPV-16 baculovirus transfer vector 114K-L1-pSynwtVI- (Kirnbauer et al.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For HPV-16 L1, recombinant baculovirus expression vectors were generated with the peptide inserted between amino acid residues 286/287, 281/287 (replacing aa 282 to 286) or fused to the C terminus as a control (Fig.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We also designed BPV-1 L1 chimeras that incorporate the peptide in three different hypervariable regions, between amino acid residues 133/134, 282/286 (replacing aa 283 to 285) or 351/355 (replacing aa 352 to 354) (Fig.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Micrographs demonstrated pentamers and full-size or smaller VLP, indicating that peptide insertion did not prevent L1 self-assembly into higher-ordered structures (data not shown).
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Further evidence for assembly of chimeric BPV-1 L1 proteins was obtained by analytical centrifugation on 20 to 40% sucrose density gradients demonstrating a migration pattern which corresponded to both wild-type (wt) L1 VLP (bottom of gradient) as well as disassembled wt L1 pentamers (top of gradient) that were run in parallel (data not shown).

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Two classes of MAb that neutralize HPV-16 virions have been described, MAbs E70 and V5, which inhibit virus to cell binding (referred to here as class A), and U4, which does not inhibit binding (class B) (Roden et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	40	 By ELISA, both classes of MAb bound the HPV-16 C-terminal fusion protein similar to wt VLP (Fig.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	41	 There was a complete loss of binding for class A antibodies E70 and V5 to chimeras A 286/287 and B 281/287.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These results confirm and extend our previous observation that amino acids around 282 are part of the E70 epitope and also contribute to the V5 epitope (Roden et al.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	49	  It has been shown that HPV-11 capsomers contain conformational epitopes found on intact VLP (Rose et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	50	 To examine whether VLP are required for MAb binding or whether HPV-16 L1 pentamers are sufficient to display the epitopes, wt HPV-16 L1 capsids were disassembled into pentamers and the absence of VLP was verified by TEM and sucrose gradient (data not shown).
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	51	 By ELISA, MAbs V5 and U4 bound wt L1 pentamers with kinetics similar to wt VLP, whereas absorbance values for MAb E70 were significantly reduced.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	52	 These results indicated that the E70 epitope is partially sensitive to VLP disassembly (Fig.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	53	 2a), and HPV-16 L1 pentamers appear sufficient for the display of the MAb V5 (class A) and U4 (class B) epitopes.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	54	 As shown previously for low-risk HPV-11, we demonstrate for the first time that high-risk HPV-16 L1 capsomers display at least a subset of the neutralization epitopes found on full-size VLP.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	55	As with HPV, two classes of MAb that neutralize BPV virions have been described, those represented by MAbs #6 and #9 (both of class A), and MAb 5B6 (class B) (Roden et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	56	 When BPV-1 chimeric L1 proteins or pentamers disassembled from wt L1 VLP under reducing conditions (3% 2-mercaptoethanol/150 mM NaCl) (McCarthy et al.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	58	 2b), binding of MAb #6 (class A) to wt L1 VLP, the chimeric BPV-1 L1 proteins D 133/134, E 282/286 and wt L1 pentamers was observed.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Data for MAb #6 binding to chimera F 351/355 were inconclusive as absorbance values did not decline across 3 logs of antibody dilution.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These results indicate that wt pentamers appear sufficient for the display of the #6 epitope and that the determinants were not contained within the targeted L1 regions of chimeras D 133/134 and E 282/286.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Antibody #9 (class A) recognized VLP of wt L1 and chimera D 133/134, but no binding was seen with chimeras E 282/286 and F 351/355.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This finding raises the possibility that peptide insertion at aa 282/286 and 351/355 had either directly targeted the respective BPV neutralization epitope or indirectly affected the quaternary structure of the particles.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In addition, wt pentamers did not react, indicating that MAb #9 requires assembly into VLP for binding.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The above findings add to published results indicating that residues 282 to 286 and 351 to 355 form part of the neutralization epitopes (Ludmerer et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Reactivity of MAb 5B6 (class B) was specifically absent for construct F 351/355, indicating that peptide targeting to aa 351/355 interrupted the 5B6 epitope.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This interpretation is consistent with the observation that aa 346 of the analogous region of HPV-11 L1 is critical for binding of a neutralizing MAb (Ludmerer et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	67	, 1996 ), although an indirect effect on quaternary structure remains possible.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Interestingly, in high resolution reconstructions, MAb 5B6 binds monovalently or divalently to (neighbouring) hexavalent capsomers just above intercapsomer cross-bridges (Trus et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Taken together these data suggest that aa 351 to 355 contribute to the 5B6 epitope at a virion surface location close to the interpentamer connections.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In addition, pentamers appear sufficient for the display of this neutralization epitope.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Our results also identify the existence of two sub-classes of neutralizing antibodies within those antibodies that interfere with binding of particles to cell surface (class A).
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	72	 One sub-class (MAb #6) can bind both to intact VLPs and to pentamers/capsomers, while the other sub-class (MAb #9) requires the higher-ordered structure of VLP for binding.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The BPV pentamer results are similar to those for the HPV-16 pentamers, which were deficient for E70 binding but bound V5 similarly to intact VLPs.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	74	To examine the effect of peptide insertion on the immunogenicity of BPV-1 L1 proteins, three mice each were injected with native or denatured protein preparations and boosted twice in 2-week intervals.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Two weeks after the last immunization, pooled sera were analysed for antibodies against the LELDKWAS peptide and for BPV-neutralizing activity using an in vitro focus-forming assay (Dvoretzky et al.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Sera raised against native preparations of chimeras D 133/134, E 282/286 and wt VLP neutralized BPV virions with a titre of 1000, 100 and 10000 respectively.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This indicated that these chimeric proteins retain PV-neutralization epitopes, although the potency to induce neutralization activity was lower than that of wt VLP.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These results suggest the feasibility of inserting epitopes of choice into immunogenic regions of L1, e.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	79	 to generate HPV vaccines with a broad-spectrum protection.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In contrast, sera raised against chimera F 351/355 were non-neutralizing, suggesting that peptide insertion at residues 351/355 had disrupted a major immunogenic determinant(s).
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	81	To evaluate the potential of assembled chimeric BPV-1 L1 proteins to induce antibodies against the inserted epitope, sera were analysed by ELISA using alkaline phosphatase (AP) to LELDKWAS as the antigen (Fig.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Antisera raised against chimera E 282/286 showed insignificant binding to the LELDKWAS peptide, whereas sera raised against chimera F 351/355 showed reactivity comparable to that obtained with MAb 2F5.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Thus insertion of a foreign peptide at 351/355 (chimera F) generated a protein that efficiently induced anti-peptide antibodies, while binding of MAb 5B6 and the capacity to induce BPV-neutralizing antisera were completely abrogated.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This change of function provides additional evidence that amino acids around 351/355 contribute to an immunodominant neutralization surface structure.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Sera raised against chimera D 133/134 also demonstrated significant binding, implicating residues 133/134 as part of another immunogenic region.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Remarkably, denatured proteins did not induce immunoreactivity against the peptide, although sera contained antibodies to linear L1 epitopes.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This indicated that placing a foreign peptide in the context of an assembled structure markedly enhanced its immunogenicity, whereas the peptide appeared subdominant when presented as denatured (linear) chimeric L1 to LELDKWAS protein.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	95	 It is likely that in the context of chimeric VLP the epitope did not present in its native conformation as detected on infectious HIV virions.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Alternatively, it is possible that the antibody concentration in the sera was too low to score in the assay.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	97	This observation represents an important extension to previous results generating autoantibodies against a self-antigen (Chackerian et al.

0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	104	The identification of neutralization, immunogenic and mutation-permissive capsid regions may be relevant for HPV vaccine design and allows a rational approach for the insertion of epitopes of choice.
0.33479095.11602792.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The display of foreign peptides in the context of an immunogenic self-assembled L1 oligomer can induce a vigorous humoral immune response and may thus become a more general procedure to overcome the low immunogenicity of free peptide antigens.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Human cyclin L2 shares significant homology to cyclin L1, K, T1, T2, and C, which are involved in transcriptional regulation via phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The cyclin L2 protein contains an N-terminal "cyclin box" and C-terminal dipeptide repeats of alternating arginines and serines, a hallmark of the SR family of splicing factors.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A new isoform and the mouse homologue of human cyclin L2 have also been cloned in this study.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Human cyclin L2 is expressed ubiquitously in normal human tissues and tumor cells.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We show here that cyclin L2 co-localizes with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8 within nuclear speckles and that it associates with hyperphosphorylated, but not hypophosphorylated, RNA polymerase II and CDK p110 PITSLRE kinase via its N-terminal cyclin domains.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It can also associate with the SC-35 and 9G8 through its RS repeat region.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cyclins are key regulatory proteins that complex with and activate cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 subunits (1 to 4), playing pivotal roles in the regulation of cell cycle progression (5).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Cyclins may be currently classified into two major groups, seemingly reflecting their functions.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The cell cycle regulator cyclins, composed primarily of cyclin A, B, D1, D2, D3, E, and F, function with their CDK partners including CDK1, -2, -3, and -4 to regulate promotion of the cell cycle.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The transcription regulator cyclins, which include cyclin C, H, K, L1, T1, and T2, work together with CDK7, -8, and -9 and tend to play roles in transcriptional regulation (6).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The proposed functions of cyclin G1 and G2 are seemingly distinct from either cell cycle or transcriptional regulation (7).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other cyclins have also been identified, but their roles in cell cycle control and RNA transcription, if any, are unclear and remain to be studied.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	20	Transcription regulator cyclin/CDK pairs are associated with the initiation, elongation, and processing of RNA transcripts.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	21	 During this process cyclins interact with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, phosphorylating the C-terminal domain (CTD) via their partner CDKs.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It is widely accepted that transcription and RNA processing are closely related.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Capping enzymes, polyadenylation factors, and splicing factors assemble at the CTD of RNA polymerase II.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) stimulates RNA splicing, and the CTD has been observed to target some splicing factors to RNA transcription sites in vivo (8).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Although there is no direct evidence to support a critical role for transcription regulator cyclins in regulation of cell cycle progression or cellular apoptosis, some results have implied that one transcription regulator cyclin, cyclin C, may be important for the regulation of cell proliferation in cooperation with c-Myc.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Cyclin C has been reported to regulate both cell cycling and cell adhesion, suggesting that this cyclin may play some part in regulating both the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (9).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It thus appears that some transcription regulator cyclins may also be involved in cell cycle progression or apoptosis, RNA transcription, and DNA repair, although the precise role of the phenomena remains to be elucidated.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	28	In addition to small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles and spliceosome-associated proteins, SR proteins compose another group of splicing factors.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	29	 SR proteins have a characteristic C-terminal Arg/Ser-rich repeat of variable length (RS domain) and RNA-binding domains in the N terminus and constitute a family of highly conserved nuclear phosphoproteins that can function as both essential and alternative pre-mRNA splicing factors (10, 11).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	30	 SR-related proteins, proteins that are structurally and functionally distinct from the SR family, have also been identified.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These proteins generally contain RS domains but not RNA-binding domains, are associated with the transcriptional machinery or mRNA 3'-end formation, and have been implicated in export.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Cyclin L1 (originally named cyclin L) is the first known example of a cyclin containing an RS domain in addition to a typical "cyclin box" (12).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	33	We report here a novel candidate cyclin, human cyclin L2 (CCNL2), first identified by large scale random sequencing of a cDNA library of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Human cyclin L2 is also a cyclin box and RS repeat region-containing protein and localizes within the nuclear speckles, co-localizing with splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We demonstrate that human cyclin L2 associates with RNAPIIo, CDK p110 PITSLRE kinase (CDK11), SC-35, and 9G8.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition, recombinant cyclin L2 protein can stimulate in vitro mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, overexpression of exogenous cyclin L2 can suppress the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC 7721 cells both in vitro and in vivo, inducing cellular apoptosis, possibly by up-regulating expression of p53 and Bax and down-regulating Bcl-2.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These results suggest that cyclin L2 may be a functional cyclin that associates with transcriptional regulation and participates in regulating the pre-mRNA splicing process.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The mechanism by which cyclin L2 suppresses the growth and induces apoptosis of tumor cells requires further investigation.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The first cyclins were identified and named due to their critical function in the regulation of the cell cycle, but some cyclins and their partner molecules, CDKs, are now recognized to have important functions beyond regulation of the cell cycle (23).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	298	 These cyclins include cyclin C, H, T1, T2, K, and L1, which have proposed roles in transcriptional regulation, and cyclin G1, G2, and I, which appear to have distinct roles from either cell cycle or transcriptional regulation (24).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel cyclin family member, cyclin L2.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Among the known human cyclin proteins, cyclin L2 is most closely related to the C-type cyclins, such as cyclins L1, K, T1, T2, and C, particularly in the cyclin box region.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	302	 C-type cyclins and their CDK partners are defined by their capacity to phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II, a step required for transcriptional elongation and RNA processing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It has been reported that cyclin H/CDK7 (25, 26), cyclin C/CDK8 (27), and cyclin K/CDK9 (28 to 30) promote transcriptional elongation and affect RNA processing indirectly through phosphorylation of the CTD.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Phosphorylation of the CTD by cyclin T/CDK9 is shown to be essential for the transition from initiation of transcription to effective elongation of nascent mRNA transcripts (31).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Based on sequence homology and the experimental observation that human cyclin L2 immunoprecipitates are associated with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, it is very likely that CTD is also a target of cyclin L2/CDK in vivo.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	308	 RS domains have been discovered in several factors associated with transcription components, including the SR-like CTD-associated factors (33) and in a 3'-end cleavage factor, cleavage factor-I 68-kDa subunit (34), suggesting that communication between splicing and both transcription and 3'-end processing might in some cases be mediated by interactions involving RS domain proteins (35, 36).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	309	 We have confirmed the stimulatory effect of cyclin L2 in pre-mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	310	 This activity may be mediated by interaction through its cyclin domains with RNA polymerase II and CDK p110 PITSLRE, or direct or indirect interaction via cyclin domain/RS repeat region with SC-35 and 9G8, as an RNA elongation/processing unit, in the nuclear speckles.

0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	331	 In our study, following transient expression of cyclin L2 in SMMC 7721 cells, p53 and Bax expression was observed to increase significantly, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression could also be observed.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of p53 can transactivate Bax expression and inhibit Bcl-2 expression, resulting in apoptotic cell death (45).
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Combined with other observations, including its association with RNAPII, CDK p110 PITSLRE, and splicing factors, and its stimulatory effect in pre-mRNA splicing, our results suggest that overexpression of cyclin L2 might regulate the RNA transcription and processing of certain apoptosis-related factors, possibly through a p53-dependent increase in Bax and reduction in Bcl-2 pathway signaling, leading to tumor cell growth inhibition.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	334	In conclusion, we report here the cloning of human and mouse cyclin L2, the association of human cyclin L2 with p110 PITSLRE and the splicing factors SC-35 and 9G8, and the potential involvement of human cyclin L2 in the stimulation of pre-mRNA splicing.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing effects of human cyclin L2 on tumor cells was also observed both in vitro and in vivo.
0.22396544.14684736.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Further experiments are required to elucidate the roles of the novel molecule, human cyclin L2, in transcriptional regulation and cell growth suppression and the related mechanisms.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The crystal structure of a ssThr26Ala mutant of human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH) has been determined to 3.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The hFSH mutant was expressed in baculovirus-infected Hi5 insect cells and purified by affinity chromatography, using a sshFSH-specific monoclonal antibody.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The ssThr26Ala mutation results in elimination of the ssAsn24 glycosylation site, yielding protein more suitable for crystallization without affecting the receptor binding and signal transduction activity of the glycohormone.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The crystal structure has two independent hFSH molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of about 80%.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The - and sssubunits of hFSH have similar folds, consisting of central cystine-knot motifs from which three ss-hairpins extend.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The two subunits associate very tightly in a head-to-tail arrangement, forming an elongated, slightly curved structure, similar to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The hFSH heterodimers differ only in the conformations of the amino and carboxy termini and the second loop of the ss-subunit (L2ss).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Detailed comparison of the structures of hFSH and hCG reveals several differences in the ss-subunits that may be important with respect to receptor binding specificity or signal transduction.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These differences include conformational changes and/or differential distributions of polar or charged residues in loops L3ss (hFSH residues 62 to 73), the cystine noose, or determinant loop (residues 87 to 94), and the carboxy-terminal loop (residues 94 to 104).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	12	 An additional interesting feature of the hFSH structure is an extensive hydrophobic patch in the area formed by loops L1, L3, and ssL2.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Glycosylation at Asn52 is well known to be required for full signal transduction activity and heterodimer stability.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The structure reveals an intersubunit hydrogen bonding interaction between this carbohydrate and ssTyr58, an indication of a mechanism by which the carbohydrate may stabilize the heterodimer.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   FSH is a member of the family of pituitary glycoprotein hormones (GPH) that play key roles in human fertility.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The GPH, which also include CG, LH, and TSH, are heterodimers, each consisting of a common -subunit (92 amino acids) and a unique ss-subunit (111 amino acids in FSH) (1, 2, 3, 4).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	17	 FSH acts by binding to G protein-coupled receptors that signal, in part, through the protein kinase A pathway (5, 6).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	18	 FSH enables ovarian folliculogenesis to the antral follicle stage and is essential for Sertoli cell proliferation and maintenance of sperm quality in the testis.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The amino acids in GPH that have been identified as critical for receptor binding are striking in similarity, yet they are not the residues essential for signal transduction (7).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Identification of GPH residues that are key to signal transduction could provide for the development of molecular mimetics or antagonists of GPH action, with clinical applications in fertility management (8) and treatment of thyroid disorders (9).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	21	Glycosylation of the GPH has been shown to be important in circulatory persistence and clearance, and in bioactivity (10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Each subunit contains two glycosylation sites: at Asn52 and Asn78 in the - subunit and at conserved sites in the ss-subunit, Asn7 and Asn24 in human FSH (hFSH).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	23	 ss-Subunit glycosylation has been reported to affect disulfide bond formation and rate of secretion, with site 2 having a greater effect than site 1, especially on secretion (15).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Glycosylation at Asn78 appears to be important for thermal stability (16).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Deglycosylation of hFSH and hCG at Asn52 has long been accepted to impair signal transduction while allowing full binding activity, suggesting that receptor binding and signal transduction are two separate functions involving different residues and that the carbohydrate is key to signal transduction.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recent evidence suggests that deglycosylation at Asn52 causes hCG to be metastable, and dissociation of the subunits occurs at 37 C (17).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In that study, disulfide bonds engineered between the subunits could overcome the effect of deglycosylation on signal transduction.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Although such studies have not been performed for hFSH, they obscure previous results with deglycosylated GPH and demonstrate that the carbohydrate at Asn52 is not essential for full signal transduction if the subunit association is otherwise stabilized.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	29	 It remains unclear whether the carbohydrate, or the lack of it, affects the structure of all GPH, or whether the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds stabilizes hCG in a conformation that is signal transduction competent.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	30	Previous structural studies of GPH heteroolimers are limited to two independent reports of the crystal structure of human CG (hCG), partially deglycosylated by hydrogen fluoride treatment (3, 4), and a recent report of a low resolution structure of the ternary complex of fully glycosylated hCG with two Fv fragments (18).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	31	 With the goal of determining the structure of fully active, glycosylated hFSH, we achieved high-level expression of hFSH in Hi5 insect cells and established a method for purification that produces biologically active hFSH.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	32	 As part of studies of the glycosylation of hFSH, it was observed that glycosylation at Asn24 of the ss-subunit is detectable in only about half of the molecules (7).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To reduce glycoform heterogeneity, in anticipation that this would facilitate crystallization, glycosylation at ssAsn24 was eliminated by site- directed mutagenesis, converting Thr26 to Ala.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This isoform of hFSH was fully active and yielded crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Here, we report the structure of ssT26A-hFSH and compare it to that of hCG.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	36	   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Characterization of Recombinant hFSH-ssT26A Amino acid sequencing of purified, Hi5 insect cell-expressed, hFSH-ssT26A revealed N termini of -APDVQDCPEC and ss-CELTNITIAI, indicating that the -subunit signal peptide was cleaved as in mammalian cells but that the ss-subunit lacked the two amino-terminal residues (Asn, Ser).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Purified hFSH-ssT26A was similar in activity to hFSH expressed in insect cells, was stable during a 16-h incubation period at room temperature, and bound receptor, effectively competing with labeled pituitary hFSH for binding to hFSH receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Fig.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	38	 As expected, the biological activity of hFSH-ssT26A was indistinguishable from wild-type hFSH, showing dose-response-related stimulation of progesterone production (Fig.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The crystals of the ssT26A mutant were grown by macroseeding methods under similar conditions, and initial crystals were obtained by cross-seeding with the recombinant wild-type hFSH.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The final crystallization conditions were similar to those of the initial pituitary protein conditions, except that the crystals grew most consistently at pH 9.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Both hFSH molecules have identical conformations in this area, despite the fact that this loop in hFSH1 is involved in more intermolecular contacts than in hFSH2.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Therefore, differences between hFSH and hCG are caused by divergent sequences in this area (Fig.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Biochemical data indicate that the ss-subunit carboxy terminus plays a role in hFSH receptor binding, because alanine substitution of the three residues Arg97-Gly98-Leu99 (27), as well as replacement of the hFSH residues 95 to 100 with the corresponding residues of human LH (hLH) (26), diminishes hFSH receptor binding.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, swapping hLH residues for hFSH residues at this locus does not allow for LH receptor binding by the hFSH-LH chimera (26).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The biochemical data are consistent with the structure, in that these residues clearly adopt a different conformation, allowing for differential recognition by the appropriate receptor.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, the changes in this region alone are not sufficient to change the receptor specificity of the hormone.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Comparison of the structures of hFSH and hCG indicate that glycosylation has no global effect on the glycohormone conformations.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Although the conformation of the insect cell-expressed, and fully active, hFSH differs significantly from that of more extensively deglycosylated, HF-treated hCG in several loops, none of these differences can be directly correlated with differences in the glycosylation.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The structure of hFSH reveals one likely mechanism by which the oligosaccharide contributes to heterodimer stability (17).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The nitrogen atom of the acetamido group of the Asn-proximal GlcNAc at Asn52 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of ssTyr58, thereby adding an additional intersubunit contact.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In hCG, the equivalent residue is Phe64, incapable of forming a similar hydrogen bond, but able to make a hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic side of the sugar ring.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	200	 While the single additional hydrogen bond observed in the hFSH structure may not be adequate to explain the higher stability of the glycosylated heterodimer, it is quite possible that sugar groups not fully defined in the electron density map make additional contacts.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	201	 A propeller-shaped triad of aromatic residues, Phe17, Phe74, and ssTyr39, together with Pro16, Phe18, and Met71, forms a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch at the end of the hFSH heterodimer composed of loops L1, L3, and ssL2 (Fig.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This region includes only three charged residues (Lys75, ssLys40, and ssAsp41), all of which are directed away from the hydrophobic patch.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In hCG, ssLeu45 replaces hFSH ssTyr 39 and the patch is smaller because of a difference in the conformation of the ssL2 loop.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This area may play a major role in receptor binding.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Although the relevance of the L1 loop in hFSH (residues 14 to 27) has not been evaluated by mutagenesis studies, epitope mapping with monoclonal antibodies revealed a discontinuous immunoneutralizing epitope comprised of residues 11 to 27 and 61 to 92 (29, 30).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Mutational analysis of Phe74 revealed only a modest decrease in hFSH binding to receptor.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In contrast to the importance of L1 and L3, alanine scanning mutagenesis has shown that ssL2 (residues 33 to 53) is not essential for hFSH binding to receptor (31).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Rather, ssL2 appears to be important in stabilizing the heterodimer association (32).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The -subunit carboxy terminus has been implicated in receptor binding in hCG (33, 34, 35), hFSH (36), and TSH (37).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Clearly, this region is very flexible in hFSH because it adopts different conformations in hFSH1 and hFSH2 and electron density is lacking for the last two residues, 91 to 92.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about how this region is involved in receptor binding.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The only clear difference between hFSH and hCG is the formation of a hydrogen bond between the side chain NH of Arg95 from the cystine noose of hCG with the carbonyl oxygen of 89, constraining the conformational flexibility of hCG.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This bond is not possible in the hFSH structure, because the hFSH -carboxy terminus is not as close to the cystine noose.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This difference in conformation is interesting in the context of receptor interaction, as the residues in the carboxy terminus of the -subunit are essential for hFSH and hCG binding (34, 35, 36).
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	215	Conclusion The overall structures of hFSH and hCG are similar, but several intriguing differences are observed in specific loops, especially in the ss-subunit.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The largest difference is at one end of the molecule where ssL1 and ssL3 move together toward the concave side of the molecule in hFSH compared with hCG.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	217	 In addition, the ssL3 loop has a very different conformation as a result of major differences in the amino acid sequence.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Currently, no biological data are available regarding the importance of these loops in receptor binding or signal transduction.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The three other areas with different conformations, the ss carboxy-terminal loop, the cystine noose, and the hydrophobic patch area between loops L1, L3, and ssL2 also have different surface characteristics.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In addition, several residues in these areas have been shown, by scanning alanine mutagenesis or epitope mapping, to play a role in receptor binding (Fig.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Interestingly, the ss-carboxy-terminal loop, the cystine noose, and the ssL1 and ssL3 loops are located on the concave side of the heterodimer (Fig.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	222	 8), resulting in a face that is very different in the two gonadotropins.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These differences are therefore very likely to be important for discrimination between hFSH and hCG by their respective receptors.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The correct space group and enantiomer were determining by examining the figure-of-merit (FOM) for both space groups with each hand.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	277	 This clearly indicated that P41212 was the correct space group, FOM 0.

0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	279	 All four derivatives had relatively weak phasing power due to low occupancy, and the sites of the platinum and osmium derivatives were similar.
0.15123306.11222739.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, solvent flattening [CCP4 program DM (40)] greatly improved the quality of the phases because of the very high solvent content of the crystals (80%).

0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, removal of EDTA and the addition of Ca2+ resulted in a loss of 90% of the protein due to significant aggregation of VP1-WW150; this indicated a strong decrease of the solubility of the reduced capsid species which resulted in precipitation until the protein concentration fell below a critical limit.
0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This was not due to aggregation via the WW domain in the presence of Ca2+ since the solubility of similar concentrations of the GST-WW protein did not decrease upon addition of CaCl2 (data not shown).

0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	168	Although theoretical considerations and calculations suggested that the WW domain could fold independently in both ss-turns, which we chose for insertion into the VP1 sequence, only one variant, VP1-WW150, could specifically interact with proline-rich ligands.
0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This was expected from CD and thermal denaturation experiments that demonstrated that the WW domain is only folded in VP1-WW150.
0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Probably, the conformation of the DE loop of VP1 is more compatible with the WW domain structure than the alternative HI loop.
0.15323845.11739895.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This might not be a general conclusion since previous experiments demonstrated that insertion of an enzyme, namely dihydrofolate reductase, into the polyomavirus HI loop, yielded pentamers with enzymatic activity; however, these pentamers formed smaller virus-like particles than the VP1-wild-type protein (Gleiter et al.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This process is thought to involve formation of a transient  kissing  complex over the self-complementary loop bases, which then refolds into a more stable extended interaction.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We have developed a novel experimental system that allows us to clearly detect the extended duplex in vitro.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Ribozyme sequences were incorporated into or adjacent to the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus DIS stem, leading to the formation of a functional ribozyme only in the extended duplex conformer.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Here we show that extended duplex formation results in ribozyme cleavage, thus demonstrating the double-stranded nature of the extended complex and confirming that refolding occurs via melting of the DIS stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Loop complementarity is essential for extended duplex formation but no sequence requirements for the loops were observed.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Efficiency of extended duplex formation is dependent on the strength of the loop to loop interaction, temperature, the magnesium concentration and is strongly accelerated by the viral nucleocapsid protein NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Our ribozyme-coupled approach should be applicable to the analyses of other refolding processes involving RNA loop to loop interactions.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Mature retroviral particles contain two positive-strand genomic RNAs, which are non-covalently linked within a region close to their 5' ends termed the dimer linkage structure (DLS).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Retroviral RNA dimerisation is considered to play an important role in such essential processes like encapsidation, maturation or reverse transcription (1,2).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Within the DLS of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), a highly conserved stem to loop structure was shown to be specifically required for the initiation of genomic RNA dimerisation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Deletion of this sequence element called the dimerisation initiation site (DIS) prevents dimerisation and leads to reduced infectivity as well as drastically reduced replication rates (3 to 7).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The DIS element is a 35 nt stem to loop structure with an internal bulge and a hexameric palindromic sequence within the loop, which is flanked by highly conserved purine nucleotides (Fig.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The most common self-complementary sequences in the DIS loop are GCGCGC (subtype B or LAI variant as well as subtype D) and GUGCAC (subtype A or MAL variant as well as subtype G and C of group O).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Two purine nucleotides are usually located 5' adjacent to the palindromic sequence and one purine nucleotide at the 3' side.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The DIS stem to loops were shown to interact with each other through Watson to Crick base pairing of their palindromic loop sequences forming a structure called a kissing complex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In the current model of DIS-mediated dimerisation, this kissing complex is converted into a more stable extended structure.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	24	 While the loop to loop base pairing is maintained, the intramolecular base pairs of the DIS stems are opened and become involved in intermolecular interactions, forming a double-stranded RNA (8,9).

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Heterodimers are formed by kissing interaction between the loop bases of two RNA stem to loops, each containing one part of a ribozyme (red and blue boxes).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Only structural rearrangement into a double-stranded extended dimer, but not the kissing complex, leads to the formation of a functional ribozyme.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	30	  Short synthetic RNAs containing the DIS hairpin are able to dimerise spontaneously in vitro, whereas RNAs resembling the retroviral 5' region but lacking this hairpin fail to do so.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In vitro experiments revealed that RNAs corresponding to the whole DIS stem to loop structure are able to form complexes of different stabilities depending on the incubation conditions.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	32	 At 37 degrees C, a less stable complex, formed via base pairing of the complementary loop sequences, is found and corresponds to the kissing complex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Incubation of these RNAs at 55 degrees C generates a more stable complex (10).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	34	X-ray and NMR structural data is available for subtypes A and B HIV-1 DIS both in the kissing complex as well as in the extended conformation (11 to 13).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The crystal structures obtained from 23mer RNAs that contain the loop as well as the apical stem of the kissing complex of both viral subtypes (MAL and LAI) are virtually identical.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In both cases, the two hairpins are in perfect coaxial alignment, thereby strongly resembling the structure of the extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In contrast, the solution structure obtained by NMR reveals a different picture, with the loop closing bases unpaired and the kissing loop helix not in A-form geometry, but distorted and kinked.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Compared with the X-ray structure, the NMR structure shows an entirely different orientation of the 5' unpaired loop purines, suggesting that these bases are involved in non-canonical base pairing with partial stacking (11).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	39	Recently, fluorescence techniques were used to demonstrate the refolding of small DIS-like RNAs in the presence of the HIV nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (14).

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Two different ribozyme systems were used in our study, the hammerhead ribozyme (15) and the synthetic leadzyme, which had been isolated via in vitro selection (16).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Using these two systems, we investigated structural requirements, the influence of temperature and magnesium concentration as well as the impact of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (17,18) on extended duplex formation in vitro.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These non-self-complementary sequences are unable to form homodimers, which might interfere with the dimerisation reaction.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Additionally, these RNAs do not have a central GC pair within the complementary hexanucleotide sequence of the loop, which had previously been suggested to be essential for dimerisation (8,9,21).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	156	 As shown in Figure 5a, extended duplex formation of the nsc constructs is slightly more efficient than that of the MAL constructs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Therefore, dimerisation can be promoted by kissing complexes formed by sequences other than the wild-type palindromes.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Neither self-complementarity nor the central GC nucleotides are required for the refolding reaction.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This is not unexpected as extended duplex formation requires opening of all DIS stem base pairs (12 in the case of L1 RNA) so they can then undergo intermolecular base pairing.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This refolding process represents a kinetic barrier that has to be overcome to establish the thermodynamically more stable extended duplex conformation.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	169	 5b) were designed in which 2 bp from the upper DIS stem were deleted.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	170	 These shorter constructs, termed L1s and L2s, were tested at 37 and 55 degrees C for their ability to form the extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	171	 At 37 degrees C, both L1/L2 and L1s/L2s show similar behaviour.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	172	 At 55 degrees C we observed a slight but reproducible increase in cleavage efficiency that lies within the error range of the experiments.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, weakening of the upper stem by only 2 bp is not sufficient to significantly increase the efficiency of extended duplex formation (Fig.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	193	 NCp7 also catalyses conversion of small DIS-like RNAs ( < 25 nt) into the extended duplex form (14).

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It has been shown to posses nucleic acid annealing and strand exchange activity in vitro (28,29), RNA chaperone activity in vivo (30) and it also accelerates cleavage of the hammerhead ribozyme (19).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	196	We set out to test whether the NCp7 protein would also enhance extended duplex formation in our system.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	198	 As shown in Figure 6c, NCp7 strongly increases extended duplex formation between L1 and L2 RNAs.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Sixty percent of the RNAs are refolded after only 5 min at 37 degrees C compared with 10% in the absence of NCp7 (Fig.

0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	204	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Here we present a novel experimental approach to monitor refolding of two RNA hairpins into an extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The system consists of two HIV-1-derived DIS hairpins, each fused to one half of a ribozyme.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Refolding of the heterodimeric DIS kissing complex into a partially double-stranded extended RNA duplex leads to formation of an active ribozyme and a specific cleavage event.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The advantage of this system over previous analysis methods using native gel electrophoresis is the clear discrimination between kissing complex and extended duplex due to the formation of a cleavage product.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The reversibility of the folding process reduces the applicability of native gel electrophoresis.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The ribozyme system results in an irreversible and easily detectable product allowing a wide range of external parameters and structural requirements to be tested.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Our approach clearly demonstrates that ribozymes are useful tools for the monitoring of RNA refolding processes.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	211	Formation of the active ribozyme after refolding of the hairpins into the extended duplex clearly demonstrated the double-stranded nature of the extended dimers.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Our results further confirm the current model of HIV-1 DIS dimerisation involving refolding of the kissing complex with melting of the stems into a partially double-stranded dimer and rule out a hypothetical mechanism for extended duplex formation involving symmetric cleavage of both chains and subsequent religation (13).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	213	 From crystal structure data, it was found that the 2' OH group of the second purine residue 5' to the complementary sequence is in favourable position for an in line attack on the neighbouring 3' phosphate.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	214	 A mechanism involving a nucleophilic attack leading to strand scission, followed by a dangling movement of this base and cross religation of both RNAs was proposed.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Such a mechanism would join both DIS stem to loop RNAs within their loop regions keeping the initial stems intact.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	216	 If this were true, both parts of the ribozyme would remain separated from each other and would be unable to form a functional ribozyme.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Our observation that extended duplex formation leads indeed to ribozyme cleavage therefore strongly supports the refolding model with the melting of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	218	We further show that formation of a kissing complex through interaction of complementary loop nucleotides is an essential prerequisite for extended duplex formation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	219	 In contrast to previous reports investigating viral RNA dimerisation in vitro, we found that neither self-complementarity nor the central GC pairs within the palindrome are essential for refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It has been suggested that the central GC pairs are essential for efficient dimerisation in vitro possibly through the involvement in non-canonical base pair interactions by forming a potential nucleation point of the dimer (8,9,21).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Our results are in accordance with in vitro selection data that show that this dinucleotide favours dimerisation but is not essential (31,32).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Self-complementarity of the loops is evidently required for viral RNA dimerisation of homologous strands, but apparently not for the refolding process per se.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These observations are particularly interesting given the fact that only two different loop sequences have been found in HIV-1 isolates, raising the question on the nature of the selective pressure for these two sequences since they can be substituted by other sequences for extended duplex formation in vitro.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	224	 It has been shown that the entire HIV 5' leader RNA can adopt two different conformations, suggesting that sequence conservation might reflect the need to preserve these two structures (33).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	225	Extended duplex formation was still possible when only partially complementary sequences or sequences with strongly reduced loop complementarity were used.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This suggests that loop to loop interaction through partial base pairing itself is sufficient for extended duplex formation at 55 degrees C, although full complementarity, as is the case for wild-type loop sequences, strongly enhances the efficiency of the refolding process.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Assuming that reduction of loop complementarity does not affect refolding itself but only reduces kissing complex stability, then the previous findings of Berkhout and van Wamel (5) might be explained.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	228	 These authors reported strongly reduced infectivity when two GC pairs were deleted from the palindrome of HIV-1 LAI subtype; however, purified virions still contained stable dimeric RNA.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Reduced stability of the kissing complex might lead to a strong impairment of the packaging efficiency, but any loose dimers that happened to be encapsidated were still able to refold, forming stable dimers.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	230	The study on the influence of external parameters on the refolding process revealed that its efficiency is temperature dependent, suggesting that refolding proceeds by the destabilisation of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Additionally, it could be shown that the presence of magnesium ions enhances extended duplex formation although it is not essential for this process.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	232	 High magnesium concentrations accelerated the reaction in a way that very efficient extended duplex formation could already be observed at 37 degrees C.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This could be explained by a more efficient stabilisation of the kissing complex than that of the stems.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Indeed, such a strong stabilisation of the kissing complex compared with the stem is observed in the presence of magnesium ions in UV melting experiments (A.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	235	Schroeder, unpublished results).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	236	Transition from a kissing complex to an extended duplex in vitro is clearly observed at physiological temperatures in the presence of the viral nucleocapsid protein NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This small basic 55 amino acid long highly conserved RNA binding protein was reported to have general RNA chaperone activity (19,28).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	238	 In vivo experiments demonstrated that a viral protease-dependent maturation resulting in the cleavage of the gag precursor to generate nucleocapsid protein is accompanied by conversion of the dimeric RNA particles into a more heat stable dimer (24,34).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Our data show that NCp7-induced extended duplex formation is extremely efficient compared with the temperature-induced refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The amount of extended duplex formed by constructs lacking loop complementarity can be explained by the general RNA to RNA annealing activity of NCp7 (19).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This might propose a model for how extended duplex formation is promoted by NCp7.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is conceivable that NCp7 induces kissing complex formation by its RNA to RNA annealing activity and/or by its helix destabilising activity (29).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The kissing interaction might provide a stable and specific interaction surface as a starting point for an efficient refolding.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In contrast, it might be the temporal availability and spatial location of NCp7 during the viral maturation cycle that allows it to use its general nucleic acid refolding activity in a specific manner.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, it should be mentioned that it is currently unclear how the data on DIS-mediated dimerisation obtained in vitro translate to the in vivo situation, given that there is no direct evidence that the mature form of the dimer inside the viral particle is an extended duplex.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	246	RNA loop to loop interactions are involved in a variety of biological processes and some of these interactions are accompanied by structural rearrangements leading to more stable structures (reviewed in 20).
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It is often difficult to distinguish between the two alternative conformations.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Since the sequence requirements of the leadzyme are relatively small, derivates from this system could be easily used to investigate whether refolding follows RNA loop to loop interactions in other biological contexts such as antisense regulation, or bicoid mRNA localisation.
0.20245472.14602899.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Using the hammerhead system, investigation of refolding processes following RNA loop to loop interactions could be addressed in vivo as well.
