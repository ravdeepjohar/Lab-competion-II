0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	3	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in the degradation of newly synthesized, misfolded and unassembled proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Using a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system we have examined the relationship between biosynthesis and ER-associated degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a polytopic protein with 12 predicted transmembrane segments.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Our results provide direct evidence that full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR is a substrate for degradation and that degradation involves polyubiquitination and cytosolic proteolytic activity.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	6	 CFTR ubiquitination was both temperature- and ATP-dependent.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Degradation was significantly inhibited by EDTA, apyrase, and the proteasome inhibitors hemin and MG132.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Degradation was inhibited to a lesser extent by clasto-lactacystin -lactone, ALLN, and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and was relatively unaffected by lactacystin and N-tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the presence of hemin, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with ER microsomes.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, membrane-bound ubiquitinated CFTR could be subsequently degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments upon incubation in hemin-free, ATP-containing lysate.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus ER-associated degradation of CFTR occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate and likely involves recruitment of degradation machinery to the ER membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Our data suggest a model in which the degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is coupled to retrograde translocation and removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION Top Abstract Introduction References.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	14	The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 facilitates translocation, membrane integration, folding, and oligomeric assembly of most proteins found in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells (1-4).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The ER also functions to recognize misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevent their exit to the Golgi complex (5-7) through a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Substrates for ERAD, like other secretory and transmembrane proteins, are initially targeted to and translocated across the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon complex (1, 2).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, aberrantly folded proteins are selectively translocated back into the cytosol where they undergo ubiquitination and degradation by cytosolic proteases (9-11).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Certain ERAD substrates such as major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains (10, 12, 13) and unglycosylated prepro- factor undergo complete retrograde translocation into a soluble, cytosolic form prior to degradation (8).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In contrast, mutant forms of carboxypeptidase Y and unassembled T cell receptor  subunits translocate back to the cytosol but remain associated with cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (14, 15).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In both cases the generation of cytosolic intermediates is thought to occur via retrograde transport through the Sec61 translocon complex (9-11).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	21	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is also involved in the ER-associated degradation of polytopic proteins.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Yeast mutants with defective ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes or proteasome subunits show decreased degradation of mutant forms of Sec61p (16, 17), a resident ER protein with 10 predicted transmembrane segments (18).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	23	 ERAD may also play a role in ensuring proper protein levels in the ER as suggested by mevalonate-mediated regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (19-21).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane protein, approximately 80% of wild type protein and 100% of common mutant forms are degraded prior to reaching the Golgi complex (22, 23).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Recent studies have demonstrated that ER-associated degradation of CFTR also requires an intact ubiquitin conjugation pathway and likely involves the 26 S proteasome (24, 25).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	26	 While the underlying reasons for CFTR degradation remain unknown, it has been proposed that the majority of wild type CFTR, like mutant CFTR, is recognized by ER quality control machinery, because it fails to fold properly (26-29).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	27	Degradation of polytopic proteins by cytosolic proteases poses a particular problem in that multiple transmembrane (TM) segments must be removed from the membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	28	 It is unclear whether polytopic proteins, like secretory and bitopic transmembrane proteins, proceed through cytosolic intermediates prior to degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	29	 One possibility is that the proteasome might degrade only cytosolic peptide loops, leaving lumenal and/or transmembrane segments to be degraded by other proteases (7, 30).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Alternatively, degradation might be coupled to the process of retrograde translocation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	31	 To distinguish among these possibilities, it will be necessary to define the temporal relationship between recognition, retrograde translocation, and degradation events involved in polytopic protein ER degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In this regard, a cell-free system that reconstitutes ERAD is attractive, because it is readily amenable to physical and pharmacological manipulation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Using such a system, Sato et al.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	34	 (31) recently demonstrated that CFTR could be ubiquitinated cotranslationally, indicating that initial recognition events in ER degradation might occur very early in the lifetime of a polytopic protein.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In the current study we use a similar cell free system to demonstrate that CFTR ubiquitination can also occur after protein synthesis, N-linked glycosylation, and membrane integration have been completed.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We have also been able to separate the process of ubiquitination from that of degradation and now show that ubiquitinated CFTR remains tightly associated with the ER membrane until it is degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	37	 CFTR degradation is therefore physically localized to the ER.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Our results are consistent with a model in which cytosolic degradation machinery is recruited to the ER membrane by polyubiquitinated substrates and suggest that degradation occurs coincident with polypeptide removal from the lipid bilayer.

0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	258	 It now appears that translocation across the ER membrane is a bidirectional process that is regulated, in part, by the folded state of a given protein substrate.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Whereas, nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are targeted to, translocated across, and/or integrated into the ER membrane by ER translocation machinery (2, 42), proteins that fail to fold properly may also be recognized by ER quality control machinery and transported out of the ER and back to the cytosol (6, 9, 10, 15).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	260	 These observations have raised important questions regarding the process of retrograde transport across the ER membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	261	 At what stage of biogenesis are protein substrates identified? How do recognition events target proteins back to the translocon and/or facilitate movement into the cytosol? And how is this retrograde transport coupled to the process of degradation? In the current study, we address these issues by developing an in vitro system that reconstitutes de novo synthesis and ER-associated degradation of the polytopic protein CFTR.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR was a substrate for ATP-dependent ubiquitination.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	263	 In addition, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with the ER membrane until it was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Thus ubiquitination precedes retrograde translocation, and degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is physically localized to the ER membrane rather than the cytosol as proposed for some secretory and transmembrane substrates (8, 10, 13).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	265	Our results are consistent with a model in which CFTR degradation is tightly coupled to removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	266	 At least 65% of [35S]methionine-labeled CFTR was degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments, consistent with proteasomal degradation in which the resulting polypeptides are 6-9 residues in length (43).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Because a small fraction of full-length CFTR (approximately 10-15%) remained intact in nearly all experiments, the extent of degradation for individual CFTR polypeptides actually approached 80%.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Thus CFTR degradation could not be limited to large cytosolic regions containing the N terminus, nucleotide binding domains, and R domain, which together comprise 61% of the total mass but only 47% of methionine residues (40).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	269	 If all cytosolic loops within 8-15 residues from the membrane were cleaved, then degradation of all full-length CFTR polypeptide chains would liberate only 60% total CFTR methionine into the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction (40).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	270	 It therefore seems likely that proteolytic machinery such as the proteasome might participate in removal of CFTR from the lipid bilayer to gain access to transmembrane segments and/or lumenal peptide regions.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This possibility is supported by the observation that: (i) proteasome-like particles are physically localized to the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane (44) and (ii) our results that CFTR degradation occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	272	 If retrograde translocation of CFTR occurred through the Sec61 translocon, then extraction from the lipid bilayer could potentially involve the reverse process of membrane integration, namely lateral movement of TM segments from the membrane back into the translocation channel and into the cytosol (45, 46).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	273	While this study provides additional support that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in ER-associated degradation of CFTR, it is unclear why different proteasome inhibitors exhibited different effects on CFTR degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin -lactone, which covalently inactivate the active site threonine residue on the 5 subunit of the 20 S proteasome (subunit X of the mammalian proteasome) (47, 48), had relatively minor effects on CFTR degradation as determined either by disappearance of the CFTR HMW complex (Fig.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	275	 4) or generation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments (Fig.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It is interesting that clasto-lactacystin -lactone, the active form of lactacystin, is inactivated by glutathione in cells (49, 50).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Our observation that neither lactacystin nor its -lactone form inhibited the degradation of lysozyme, a known proteasome substrate, suggests that RRL is capable of rendering these agents inactive, even when preincubated in the absence of exogenous reducing agents.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	278	 We do not know why the results reported here differ from those of Qu et al.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	279	 (51) that demonstrated 20  microM lactacystin inhibited the degradation of both 1-antitrypsin and lysozyme in a similar RRL system.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, our results were consistent for two different preparations of lactacystin and at multiple inhibitor concentrations up to 100  microM.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	281	 It is possible that these differences reflect varying amounts of proteasome in different RRL preparations.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	282	The most potent inhibitors of CFTR degradation were EDTA, apyrase, and hemin.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	283	 EDTA and hemin have been shown previously to inhibit the degradation of other proteasome substrates in RRL by stabilizing HMW ubiquitin conjugates (39, 52, 53).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Hemin, a heme precursor, exerts pleiotropic effects in RRL.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Its stimulatory effect on protein translation (38) is proposed to be mediated by inactivation of the translation factor eif-2, possibly by inhibiting an endogenous RRL kinase (54, 55).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	286	 In addition, hemin directly inhibits ATPase activities of the purified 19 S proteasome regulatory complex (PA700) as well as the 26 S proteasome itself (56).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Because the catalytic core of the 20 S proteasome cannot accommodate folded or ubiquitinated polypeptides, it has been proposed that ATPases contained within the 19 S regulatory subunit are required for substrate unfolding as well as deubiquitination (43, 48, 56-59).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It is therefore likely that hemin inhibits proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation by blocking ATPase activity and thereby preventing CFTR unfolding and/or deubiquitination.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	289	 If CFTR unfolding were required for removal from the bilayer, such a mechanism would explain the accumulation of membrane-bound, polyubiquitinated CFTR observed in the current study.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	290	Our results do not rule out the possibility that additional peptidase activities either in the ER lumen or within the membrane also participate in CFTR degradation as has been suggested previously (25, 60).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	291	 One such candidate is signal peptidase complex, an ER-localized protease that is capable of cleaving transmembrane proteins (61) and free signal peptides (30) at sites located within the plane of the lipid bilayer.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Interestingly, CFTR contains cryptic signal peptidase cleavage sites within or adjacent to TM segments of the N terminus hydrophobic domain (62, 63).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	293	 If similar proteases facilitated CFTR degradation, then TM segments and small peptide loops could potentially be released from the membrane.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Such a mechanism might explain why a significant amount of CFTR degradation was ATP-independent and hemin insensitive.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	295	 It is also possible that the membrane-bound HMW complex might actually consist of polyubiquitinated CFTR cleavage products that are then degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	296	Cell-free systems have significantly enhanced our understanding of protein folding (64) and translocation (2).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	297	 However we do not yet know whether the folded state of newly synthesized CFTR in the RRL system is the same as that found in the ER of cells or whether the mechanism of CFTR recognition by ER quality control machinery in vitro is the same as in vivo.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Processing in the RRL system is limited to early events that occur at the ER membrane, and it is possible that CFTR might require specialized cellular components that are limiting in RRL and/or canine pancreas microsomes.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Recently, RRL and yeast-derived cell-free systems have been used to examine the degradation of other secretory and transmembrane proteins (8, 51), including CFTR (31).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Our observation that 85-90% of newly synthesized wild type CFTR is degraded in the RRL system is consistent with studies that demonstrate most wild type CFTR is also degraded in the ER membrane of intact cells (22, 23).
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In addition, preliminary experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that other polytopic proteins expressed in the RRL system, such as human P-glycoprotein and aquaporin water channels, are much more stable than CFTR.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	302	2 These studies indicate that rapid CFTR degradation in vitro is not simply a cell free artifact, but rather reflects specific structural features recognized by ER quality control machinery.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	303	 In vitro systems such as RRL will thus likely provide a versatile tool for investigating the events and cellular machinery involved in ER-associated degradation.
0.54181886.9915789.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In the case of CFTR, they may also provide screening assays to identify compounds that improve folding and trafficking efficiency.

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Targeting of the SRP to ribosome nascent chain complex to the RER is mediated by the interaction between the SRP and the SRP receptor (SR), a heterodimeric GTPase localized to the RER.

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	26	Ribosome to nascent chain complexes can bind to unoccupied Sec61 complexes in an SRP-independent reaction that is thought to be driven by the affinity between the ribosome and the Sec61 complex (Jungnickel and Rapoport 1995 ; Lauring et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	27	 1995a ; Raden and Gilmore 1998 ).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This artificial targeting reaction is readily observed when elongation-arrested RNCs are incubated with ribosome-stripped microsomes that contain an excess of Sec61 complexes relative to added RNCs and 80S ribosomes.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Although SRP-independent binding of the RNCs to the Sec61 complex is not signal sequence to dependent (Lauring et al.

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Nontranslating 80S ribosomes compete with RNCs for binding to the Sec61 complex, hence, they act as competitive inhibitors of the SRP-independent targeting pathway (Lauring et al.

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	287	 We reasoned that the T3-PK-RM, which retain 5% of the high affinity ribosome binding sites detectable in intact PK-RM (Fig 3 D), might be less sensitive to inhibition by 80S ribosomes when assayed for SRP-independent translocation activity.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	288	 To allow a direct comparison of the effect of competing ribosomes, the competition assays were adjusted to obtain comparable translocation activity in the absence of the competitor.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	289	 As observed previously, the addition of 80S ribosomes caused a concentration-dependent decrease in SRP-independent translocation across the undigested PK-RM (Fig 5 D, triangles).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	290	 When the protease-digested T3PK-RM were assayed, we observed that the 80S ribosomes were twofold less effective as inhibitors of SRP-independent translocation across the T3-PK-RM (Fig 5 D, squares).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Nonetheless, the 80S ribosomes did interfere with RNC binding to the Sec61 complex, suggesting that the protease-severed Sec61 complexes do retain residual affinity for the nontranslating ribosomes.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	292	Thermolysin Dissection of Sec61 Given the dramatic reduction in ribosome binding activity caused by cleavage of Sec61 at multiple sites, we incubated the PK-RM with thermolysin on ice or at 25 degrees C to achieve more selective digestion of Sec61 (Fig 6 A).

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Based upon the presence of potential cleavage sites for trypsin, chymotrypsin, and endoproteinase Glu-C in each of the four loops and two termini, it was conceivable that each cytoplasmic segment of Sec61 would be susceptible to cleavage by all three proteases, with the exception of loop 6 which lacks a predicted cleavage site for endoproteinase Glu-C.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Instead, we observed that the COOH-terminal half of Sec61 was much more sensitive to proteolysis than the NH2-terminal tail, whereas loops 2 and 4 were not digested by any protease we tested.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Although a lack of digestion within loop 4 can be explained by the short length of this segment, loop 2 is comparable in length to loop 6, so size alone cannot be the explanation.

0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	359	 However, Sec61 complex proteoliposomes retain a high affinity for ribosomes in a physiological ionic strength buffer (Kalies et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Furthermore, it is now well established that the Sec61 complex is also the ribosome binding site during the protein translocation reaction (Gorlich and Rapoport 1993 ; Kalies et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	361	 By analyzing ribosome binding to the protease-digested PK-RM in a physiological ionic strength buffer, our assay specifically monitored how proteolysis of the Sec61 complex altered binding of nontranslating ribosomes to the translocation channel.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	362	Our results support the hypothesis that the ribosome binding activity of the Sec61 complex can be ascribed to Sec61.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	363	 More than 50% of Sec61 remained intact in protease-digested membranes that lacked detectable ribosome binding (e.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	364	, T5-PK-RM and V200-PK-RM), demonstrating that Sec61 is not sufficient for ribosome binding activity.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	365	 The extreme sensitivity of Sec61ss to thermolysin digestion (not shown) yielded the Th2-PK-RM that lack intact Sec61ss yet retain considerable ribosome binding activity.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	366	 1994 had also concluded that Sec61ss was dispensable for ribosome binding to the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	367	 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Sec61ss or Sec61 help stabilize the association between the ribosome and Sec61.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	368	As the ultrastructural evidence indicates that the ribosome is tethered to the Sec61 complex via a single visible junction (Beckmann et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	369	 1997 ), it would be logical to suggest that the most exposed surface on Sec61 is the ribosome-binding site.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	370	 In support of the hypothesis that the most protease-accessible regions of Sec61 might correspond to the ribosome binding site, we observed that Sec61 complexes that lack intact Sec61 subunits do not bind nontranslating ribosomes.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	371	 A comparison of 12 eukaryotic Sec61 sequences reveals that loops 6 and 8 are highly conserved, particularly with respect to the location and number of charged amino acids.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Because the COOH terminus of Sec61 is one of the least conserved cytoplasmic segments of the Sec61 complex, an important role for the COOH terminus of Sec61 in ribosome binding was unexpected.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The results obtained with the C1-PK-RM and the Th2-PK-RM strongly support the hypothesis that loop 8 is required for ribosome binding to the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Selective cleavage of the COOH-terminal tail of Sec61, by thermolysin on ice (Th50-PK-RM), showed that this segment of Sec61 is crucial for the binding of a nontranslating ribosome to the translocation channel.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	375	Assuming that proteolysis of the translocation channel results in a random digestion of Sec61 subunits in a tetramer of Sec61 heterotrimers, the partially digested membranes should contain a mixture of translocation channels that have between zero and four intact Sec61 subunits.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	376	 One unexpected result was the observation that ribosome binding to the protease-digested PK-RM requires more than one intact Sec61 subunit per translocation channel.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Consider an example of membranes that retain 50% intact Sec61 (e.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	378	 A random 50% digestion of tetrameric translocation channels would yield a binomial distribution of channels that contain zero to four intact Sec61 subunits (6.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	379	25% with zero intact, 25% with one intact, 37.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	380	5% with two intact, 25% with three intact, and 6.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	381	 The number of ribosome binding sites we detect in C1-PK-RM or Th2-PK-RM (40 to 50% of that present in PK-RM) is much greater than the 6% of complexes that retain four intact Sec61 subunits, and is much less than the 94% of complexes that retain at least one intact Sec61 subunit.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Instead, our results are best explained by a model that requires multivalent contact between the ribosome and two or three Sec61 subunits per Sec61 oligomer.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	383	 In this regard, our demonstration that the Sec61 oligomer remains intact following proteolysis was a critical observation.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Based upon the minimal protein bridge that tethers a ribosome to the yeast Sec61 oligomer (Beckmann et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	385	 1997 ), one might have predicted that three of the Sec61 subunits in a tetrameric translocation channel could be proteolyzed without reducing ribosome binding activity.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Our interpretation of this apparent paradox is that physiological salt-insensitive binding of the ribosome to the canine Sec61 complex requires one or more secondary contact points that were not observed in the three-dimensional reconstructions of the S.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	387	 cerevisiae ribosome-Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	388	The Signal Sequence Contributes to the Specificity and Affinity of RNC Attachment The three independent methods we used to analyze RNC binding provided evidence that protease-severed Sec61 complexes bind RNCs with a reduced capacity and a reduced affinity relative to intact Sec61 complexes.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Nonetheless, RNC binding to the Sec61 complex cannot be directly equated with high affinity ribosome binding activity.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Attachment of the pPL86 RNCs to Sec61 complexes that lack high affinity ribosome binding activity is most readily explained by the hypothesis that the signal sequence of the nascent polypeptide is a second ligand that contributes significantly to the specificity and affinity of the interaction between an RNC and the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	391	 RNCs that lack a signal sequence (e.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	392	, ffLuc77) bind poorly to the protease-digested Sec61 complexes.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	393	 How can we rationalize this conclusion with the previous data showing that 80S ribosomes compete with RNCs for SRP-independent binding to the translocation channel? As noted previously (Raden and Gilmore 1998 ), 80S ribosomes do not compete on a 1:1 basis with RNCs for binding to the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	394	 We hypothesize that the signal sequence substantially enhances the affinity of the RNC for the translocation channel by reducing the dissociation rate of the ribosome from the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	395	 When ribosome competition experiments were conducted using the protease-digested PK-RM, we observed that free ribosomes were twofold less effective as competitors of RNC binding, which is consistent with the view that the affinity between the ribosome and the Sec61 complex was reduced by proteolysis.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Photo cross-linking studies indicate that the signal sequence of a nascent polypeptide is inserted into the yeast Sec61 complex, so that it contacts TM spans 2 and 7 (Plath et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Our results strongly suggest that signal sequence insertion occurs in a region of Sec61 that is inaccessible to proteases, hence, it is distinct from the cytoplasmic loops that contact the ribosome.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	398	SRP-independent Translocation of Polypeptides through Protease-digested Sec61 Complexes SRP-independent translocation through the Sec61 complex is thought to accurately mimic the RNC binding, nascent chain insertion and transport phases of the translocation reaction.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	399	 When RNCs are targeted by the SRP-independent pathway, binding of the RNC to the Sec61 complex is signal sequence to independent (Lauring et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	400	 1995a ), and is competitively inhibited by the presence of nontranslating 80S ribosomes (Lauring et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	401	 1998 ; Raden and Gilmore 1998 ).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	402	 All of the SRP-independent translocation assays described here used RNC preparations that contained the nascent chain to associated complex (NAC).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	403	 NAC, a ribosome-associated protein, is proposed to be a negative regulator of RNC binding to the Sec61 complex (Lauring et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	404	 However, this conclusion has been challenged because the endogenous NAC in wheat germ and reticulocyte lysate cytosol does not prevent RNC binding to the Sec61 complex (Neuhof et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	405	 1998 ; Raden and Gilmore 1998 ), therefore, removal of NAC was not necessary.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	406	When we assayed SRP-independent translocation across the protease-digested PK-RM, we made several unexpected observations.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	407	 Protease-digested PK-RM that lack binding sites for nontranslating ribosomes remain competent for SRP-independent translocation of pPL86.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	408	 These results indicate that a functional interaction between a nascent polypeptide and the translocation channel is not strictly dependent upon an initial high affinity binding of the ribosome to Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	409	 The most definitive resolution of the ribosome binding and the translocation promotion activities of the Sec61 complex was obtained by limited digestion of Sec61 with thermolysin.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Cleavage of the COOH terminus of Sec61 drastically reduced ribosome-binding activity while having a relatively modest effect upon SRP-independent translocation of pPL86.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	411	The interaction between an RNC and the Sec61 complex progresses through several distinct stages as the nascent polypeptide increases in length (Crowley et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	412	 1994 ; Jungnickel and Rapoport 1995 ; Nicchitta and Zheng 1997 ).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	413	 RNCs bearing preprolactin chains that are shorter than 70 residues are attached in a salt-sensitive manner even though the nascent polypeptide is in contact with Sec61.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Salt-resistant RNC attachment occurs upon further elongation when the signal sequence is inserted into a protease-inaccessible environment in the translocation channel (Connolly et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	415	 1989 ; Jungnickel and Rapoport 1995 ; Nicchitta and Zheng 1997 ).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Gating of the lumenal end of the translocation channel also occurs at this stage of nascent chain elongation and transport (Crowley et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Although the pPL86 nascent chain is of sufficient length to support the more stable interaction between an RNC and the Sec61 complex, we observed that the interaction between an RNC and the translocation channel was substantially weakened by proteolysis of Sec61.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	418	 RNCs bearing pPL86 did not remain attached to the protease-digested PK-RM on sucrose flotation gradients in a physiological ionic strength buffer (Fig 4 A).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Gel filtration chromatography, which avoids exposure of the sample to 2 M sucrose and high centrifugal fields, provided evidence that the RNCs were bound to the protease-digested PK-RM (Fig 4B and Fig C).
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Further evidence that the RNC to Sec61 interaction was altered was provided by the finding that the junction between the ribosome and the membrane was not sufficiently tight to prevent access of a macromolecular probe (proteinase K) to the nascent polypeptide.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	421	Regions of Sec61 Implicated in RNC Binding and Protein Translocation All of the protease-digested PK-RM described here were also assayed for SRP-dependent translocation activity using the procedure shown in Fig 7 A (Song et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	422	 As shown here for the Th25-PK-RM, digestion of Sec61 in either cytoplasmic loop 6 or loop 8 leads to a complete block in the SRP-dependent translocation pathway.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	423	 The restrictive block of the SRP-dependent targeting pathway is most readily explained by the accumulation of an upstream translocation intermediate that precedes transfer of the RNC from SRP54 to Sec61 (Song et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	424	 The SRP-independent pathway was not as severely inhibited by proteolysis of Sec61; cleavage within loops 6 and 8 reduced RNC binding and nascent chain translocation.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Although the moderate reduction in SRP-independent translocation activity probably reflects the reduced affinity of the translocation channel for the ribosome, our results strongly suggest that the translocation-promoting function of the Sec61 complex resides in a protease-inaccessible region of Sec61.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	426	 A molecular genetic dissection of Sec61p has suggested that an intact cytoplasmic loop 6 is crucial for the in vivo function of the Sec61 complex (Wilkinson et al.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Complementary NH2-and COOH-terminal segments of Sec61p were tested for the ability to suppress a sec61 null allele.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	428	 With the exception of NH2-terminal segments truncated within loops 6 or 7, coexpression of the complementary fragment yielded a functional Sec61p.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Thus, an intact loop 6 in Sec61 appears to be crucial for translocation of proteins across the ER.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Our results indicate that loop 8 and the COOH terminus are required for high affinity binding of ribosome to the Sec61 complex.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	431	 We propose that these two segments cooperate to form a ribosome-binding platform that is responsible for both the primary and secondary contacts between the translocation channel and the ribosome.
0.43387523.10893256.html.plaintext.txt	432	 Whereas a detailed description of the ribosome-binding site in Sec61 will require further ultrastructural and molecular genetic analysis, the results described here show that the COOH-terminal half of Sec61 should be the focus for further scrutiny.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The PDZ domain of CAL binds to the C terminus of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although CAL does not have any predicted transmembrane domains, CAL is associated with membranes mediated by a region containing the coiled-coil domains.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	8	 CAL is located primarily at the Golgi apparatus, co-localizing with trans-Golgi markers and is sensitive to Brefeldin A treatment.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that CAL exists as a multimer.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells and decreases expression, rate of insertion and half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF, a subplasma membrane PDZ domain protein, restores cell surface expression of CFTR and chloride currents.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	13	 CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	14	 CAL favors retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Thus, the regulation of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	17	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 (1-3).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	18	 CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and channel regulator (4) that mediates salt and water balance in a number of tissues, including the airways, intestines, pancreatic and sweat ducts, and kidney tubules (5).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In many polarized epithelial tissues, CFTR functions in the apical cell membrane but in the sweat duct CFTR is localized to both the apical and basolateral cell membranes.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Because a common mutation in CFTR, F508, is degraded through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated processes, many studies have focused on the trafficking of CFTR through this compartment (6).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Much less attention has been devoted to how CFTR is processed through the post-ER pathways.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	22	We reported previously that the polarization of CFTR in the apical membrane of human airway and kidney epithelial cells is altered in CFTR mutants lacking the C-terminal domain (7, 8).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These data suggested that the C-terminal domain plays a role either in the trafficking to and/or stability within the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The last three amino acids of CFTR (Thr-Arg-Leu) comprise a consensus sequence known to bind to PDZ domain proteins, a family of proteins containing a 80- to 90-amino acid motif that binds to the C terminus of a variety of ion channels and receptors (9-11).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	25	At least two PDZ domain-containing proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF (also called EBP50), and the CFTR-associated protein CAP70 are known to bind to the terminal amino acids of CFTR (12, 13).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	26	 NHE-RF is a submembranous phosphoprotein that regulates the apical membrane Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 (14).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Because NHE-RF associates with ezrin, which itself binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (15), it was hypothesized that NHE-RF anchors CFTR to the cytoskeleton at a subapical compartment targeting protein kinase A near CFTR (12).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	28	 E3KARP, an NHE-RF-related protein, was also shown to interact with CFTR (16, 17).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	29	 CAP70, a subapical protein with four PDZ domains, binds to at least two CFTR molecules simultaneously via PDZ3 and PDZ4 (18).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	30	 CAP70 and NHE-RF enhance CFTR Cl channel activity in excised patches probably by cross-linking CFTR dimers (18, 19).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	31	 NHE-RF, E3KARP, and CAP70 are localized to subplasma membrane regions reflecting their proposed roles in anchoring and/or regulating CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	32	Although there is growing evidence of a functional interaction between CFTR and PDZ domain proteins at the plasma membrane, little is known about whether PDZ domain proteins play a role in intracellular trafficking of CFTR along the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The post-ER secretory pathway involved in the trafficking of wild type and mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane is poorly characterized.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A recent study has demonstrated that CFTR has an unusually low distribution in cis-Golgi compartments compared with most membrane proteins (20), raising the possibility that CFTR may utilize novel modes of anterograde and retrograde trafficking mechanisms.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	35	To learn more about the role of the C terminus of CFTR in processing and trafficking, we used a yeast-two hybrid assay to identify proteins that bind to CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We identified a novel PDZ domain protein, CAL, that interacts with CFTR in the post-ER secretory pathway.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The PDZ domain of CAL binds directly to the C terminus of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Native CFTR and CAL localize with Golgi markers in lung tissue in vivo.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface and reduces CFTR currents both in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This suppression can be overcome by NHE-RF.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Our data demonstrate that CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Although NHE-RF alone does not enhance surface expression of CFTR, it competes with CAL for the binding of CFTR and indirectly enhances expression in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Thus, the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	136	Identification and Tissue Distribution of CAL-- To identify PDZ domain proteins that interact with CFTR, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the last 51 amino acids of the C terminus of rat CFTR (21).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Approximately 1  x  107 recombinants of a lung cDNA library fused to the Gal4 DNA activation domain were screened.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	138	 A novel protein designated as CAL (CFTR-Associated Ligand) was identified in this screening.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Fifty-six clones were isolated that encoded overlapping, partial sequences of CAL.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Each contained the consensus sequence for a complete PDZ domain.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The interaction between CFTR and CAL was confirmed by re-transforming the cloned cDNA into yeast.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The interaction was bait-dependent, because it did not occur with the vector alone.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The interaction was also dependent upon the terminal amino acids of CFTR, because it did not occur with CFTR C-terminal constructs missing the terminal 4 or 7 amino acids (data not shown).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	144	To obtain the full-length CAL, we screened a human lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) with rat CAL cDNA.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Seven independent and overlapping clones were identified.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	182	Native Properties of CAL-- To study CAL in vivo, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of human CAL (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Consistent with the wide pattern of expression of CAL mRNA, CAL protein is endogenously expressed in several cell lines, including human bronchial epithelial cells, 16HBE14o (Fig.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In Western blots, 16HBE14o cells display native CAL at two molecular masses, ~50-kDa and ~100-kDa bands (Fig.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	189	 This raises the possibility that CAL can form a homo-multimer.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	190	 To test this further, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged full-length CAL (HA-CAL) and with each one of the following myc-tagged CAL constructs: full-length (myc-CAL), a construct containing only the C-terminal portion, including the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-PDZ-C), or a construct containing only the N-terminal amino acids, including the coiled-coil domains but minus the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-N-CC).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Only in cells containing the myc-tagged full-length CAL (first lane) and the N-terminal portion of CAL (third lane) was it possible to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged full-length CAL with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Although CAL has no predicted transmembrane sequences, the coiled-coil domains conferred membrane association, presumably by binding to resident Golgi coiled-coil proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	239	CAL Binds to CFTR-- To test whether full-length CAL and CFTR interact in animal cells, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with an N-terminal-tagged, full-length HA-CAL and GFP-CFTR (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	240	 GFP-CFTR has single-channel and whole-cell current properties indistinguishable from wild type CFTR (23).

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Removal of the last 3 amino acid residues of the full-length CFTR (GFP-CFTRTRL) substantially reduced the ability of the truncated CFTR to interact with CAL (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	243	 3A, lane 3), suggesting the importance of the extreme C-terminal PDZ binding motif.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The faint band in lane 3 suggests that other weak binding sites for CAL may exist in CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	245	To test further whether the PDZ-interacting domain of CFTR is important for the CAL CFTR interaction, we conducted studies using the C terminus of CFTR and the PDZ domain of CAL (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	246	 COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged PDZ domain of CAL (HA-CAL-PDZ, aa 216-404) and the myc-tagged C terminus of CFTR (myc-CFTR-C, aa 1387-1480).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	247	 HA-CAL-PDZ was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-CFTR-C using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	248	 As a control, HA-CAL-PDZ was not immunoprecipitated by the Myc antibody in the absence of myc-CFTR-C (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Because truncation of C-terminal CFTR residues (TRL) abolishes the binding (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	250	 3A), and binding can occur between portions containing only the PDZ domain of CAL and the C terminus of CFTR (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	251	 3B), the PDZ domain-mediated interaction is both necessary and sufficient for the CAL CFTR interaction.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	252	To confirm that the C terminus of CFTR was involved in the interaction, we immobilized biotinylated peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 8 and 24 residues of CFTR on NeutrAvidin beads and incubated the peptides with whole cell lysates prepared from 16HBE14o cells.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The bound fractions were examined by Western blot using CAL antisera.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Endogenous CAL bound to the immobilized CFTR peptides (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	255	 3C, lanes 1 and 2) but not to a control peptide (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Because the last 8 residues of CFTR bind to CAL, the interaction is likely to be direct and not mediated through other proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	257	To test whether CAL is present in a complex with CFTR in vivo, CFTR was immunoprecipitated from T84 cell lysates using an R-domain antibody from Genzyme and the precipitated fraction was analyzed by Western blotting using CAL antibody.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	258	 CAL was found in the CFTR immunoprecipitated fraction (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	259	 3D, lane 1) but not in the control fraction (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	260	 In a reciprocal experiment, CAL antisera also precipitated CFTR (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Taken together, these data suggest that CFTR and CAL associate in vivo.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	262	Golgi Localization of CAL-- Next, we examined the expression of native CAL by indirect immunofluorescence staining with rabbit anti-CAL antibodies.

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	404	We identified a Golgi CFTR-interacting protein, CAL, that plays a role in regulating the plasma membrane expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	405	 CAL is the first PDZ domain protein identified that regulates the trafficking of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Biochemical evidence suggests that CAL can exist as a multimer that is mediated by domains in the N-terminal region.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	407	 CAL can form clusters of CFTR within the cell when overexpressed, suggesting that multimers of CAL may tether more than one CFTR within the cell as a mechanism to regulate export to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	408	 This is consistent with data that overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	409	 In contrast to its effect on CFTR, CAL does not affect VSVG surface expression (see Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	410	 8C) or of P-glycoprotein expression, proteins that sort to the plasma membrane but do not have C-terminal PDZ interacting domains.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	411	 CAL also does not affect surface expression of CFTRTRL, eliminating the possibility that the inhibition of surface expression is due simply to the nonspecific effect of protein overexpression.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	412	 Thus, the role of CAL is restricted to proteins such as CFTR with C-terminal, PDZ domains capable of binding CAL.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Given the wide distribution of CAL in many tissues, it is likely that CAL can regulate the surface expression of molecules other than CFTR as long as they have a C-terminal domain capable of binding to CAL.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Although CAL is located primarily located within the Golgi, it is also found at the plasma membrane where it may also function (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	415	CAL contains two putative coiled-coil domains that play a role in membrane association.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Coiled-coil domains are found in SNARE proteins and a large number of Golgi resident proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Recently, it has been shown that CAL can bind to the Q-SNARE protein syntaxin 6, a protein whose primary function is unknown (31).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	418	 It is likely that the coiled-coil domains of CAL may mediate interactions with multiple Golgi proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	419	CAL overexpression also reduces the rate of appearance of CFTR in the plasma membrane suggesting that CAL may reduce the anterograde trafficking of CFTR to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	420	 CAL also reduces the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	421	 There are at least two possible scenarios to explain how CAL may interact with CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	422	 First, CAL may be part of an anterograde trafficking complex that controls CFTR movement from ER to Golgi and to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	423	 CAL with two coiled-coil domains may tether CFTR to the Golgi as a requisite step in moving CFTR to the cell surface.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	424	 The overexpression of CAL may disrupt the stoichiometry of such an anterograde trafficking complex and favor retention of the CAL CFTR complex in the Golgi.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Second, CAL may also regulate the retrograde trafficking of CFTR from the Golgi to ER and perhaps promote the recycling of CFTR to the ER for degradation.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Thus CAL, like the PDZ protein GRASP 55/65, may play a role in vesicle budding and cargo selection in ER to Golgi and Golgi to membrane transport (35, 36).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	427	 8a, overexpression of CAL enhances the ER-localized, immature, and core-glycosylated form of CFTR (band B), which is localized to the ER.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	428	If the role of CAL is to tether CFTR to the Golgi, then what promotes CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane? Clearly, the majority of CAL is located within the Golgi, yet some is also found near the plasma membrane (Fig.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Also, membrane-biotinylated CFTR can be co-immunoprecipitated with CAL (data not shown) indicating that some CAL CFTR complexes do travel to the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Unlike CAL, other PDZ domain proteins such as NHE-RF and E3KARP are associated with the plasma membrane (12), suggesting that they play a key role in the function of CFTR at the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Our data show that, when CAL is overexpressed, CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane is reduced but that suppression can be reversed by NHE-RF.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	432	 We hypothesize that, because CAL is more abundant in the Golgi, binding of CFTR to CAL may be favored.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	433	 As a CAL CFTR complex traffics to the plasma membrane where NHE-RF is abundant, CFTR may then bind to NHE-RF, which tethers CFTR to the actin-based cytoskeleton.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	434	 This tethering of CFTR to the plasma membrane increases the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane resulting in the apical polarization of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	435	2 Overexpression of CAL increases its expression both in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane (data not shown), shifting the stoichiometry of the interaction of the CFTR with NHE-RF toward CAL and decreasing the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	436	 Our data answer a critical question as to why more than one PDZ domain protein interacts with CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	437	 At least for CAL and NHE-RF, we show that both are concentrated in different locations within the cell and only transiently interact, most likely within the plasma membrane, to regulate the surface expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Thus, this regulation by two or more PDZ domain proteins may allow for the precise regulation of CFTR surface expression.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	439	Other membrane proteins are found to bind to multiple PDZ domain proteins.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	440	 For example, the C termini of the GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA receptors bind to both GRIP/ABP, which contains 7 PDZ domains (37), and to PICK1, which contains a single PDZ domain as well as a domain that interacts with protein kinase C (38).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	441	 Phosphorylation of the C terminus of GluR2 by protein kinase C prevents its binding to GRIP but not to PICK1, which may contribute to the protein kinase C-induced rapid internalization of surface GluR2 subunits (39).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Likewise, the C terminus of the 1-adrenergic receptor binds to a pair of PDZ proteins, PSD-95 and MAGI-2 (40, 41).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	443	 Although the agonist-induced internalization of the 1-adrenergic receptor is attenuated by PSD-95 co-expression, it is markedly increased by co-expression with MAGI-2 (41).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	444	 These reports, as well as our present findings, support the notion that multiple PDZ domain proteins interact with the same short C terminus of a membrane protein to regulate its function.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	445	The precise mechanism of how CAL may hand off CFTR to NHE-RF remains unknown.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	446	 It is not clear whether it is driven strictly by mass balance, by affinity, or by a combination of these two.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	447	 In our co-expression system, NHE-RF expression is ~4.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Under these conditions, NHE-RF may sufficiently compete with CAL for CFTR binding strictly by mass action.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	449	 Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that CFTR is present in both the apical membrane and in the subapical vesicles (42).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	450	 These findings were confirmed by cryoimmunogold electron microscopy (43).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	451	 The translocation of CFTR from the intracellular pool to the plasma membrane may be regulated by protein kinase A as observed by some investigators (44, 45) but not by others (23, 46).
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	452	 It is possible that CAL may pass CFTR off to NHE-RF in the subapical vesicles.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	453	 If so, it is important to determine the endogenous levels of CAL, NHE-RF and other CFTR binding proteins in these locations, as well as their relative affinity to CFTR in native tissues that express CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	454	 It is likely that these data, together with their regulation by protein kinase A and/or other physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of CFTR trafficking and its regulation in different native tissues.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	455	In summary, we have identified a novel CFTR-interacting protein, CAL, that plays a role in the surface expression of CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Recent evidence suggests that some F508 CFTR escapes from the ER and into the early secretory pathway.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	457	 Understanding the role of interacting proteins such as CAL in CFTR trafficking may prove useful in devising strategies to increase the plasma membrane expression of F508 CFTR.
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	458	 The wide tissue distribution of CAL suggests that it may be important for trafficking of other ion channels and receptors with C-terminal sequences similar to that of CFTR.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) encodes a transmembrane protein (CFTR) which functions in part as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	5	 CFTR expression is controlled temporally and cell specifically by mechanisms that are poorly understood.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Insight into CFTR regulation could be facilitated by the successful introduction of the entire 230 kb human CFTR and adjacent sequences into mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To this end, we have introduced two different CFTR-containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (320 and 620 kb) into Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO) cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Clonal cell lines containing human CFTR were identified by PCR, and the genetic and functional analyses of one clone containing each YAC are described.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Integration of the human CFTR-containing YACs into the CHO genome at a unique site in each cell line was demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Southern blot analysis suggested that on the order of one copy of human CFTR was integrated per CHO cell genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Fiber-FISH and restriction analysis suggested that CFTR remained grossly intact.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Northern analysis showed full-length, human CFTR mRNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation with protein kinase demonstrated mature, glycosylated CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Finally, chloride secretion in response to cAMP indicated the functional nature of the human CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This study provides several novel results including: (i) functional human CFTRcan be expressed from these YACs; (ii) CHO cells are a permissive environment for expression of human CFTR; (iii) the level of human CFTR expression in CHO cells is unexpectedly high given the lack of endogenous CFTR production; and (iv) the suggestion by Fiber-FISH of CFTR integrity correlates with functional gene expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	17	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population (1 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) leading to the loss of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated chloride efflux from epithelial cells (2 -4 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	19	 CFTR is a 230 kb gene encoding a 1480 amino acid transmembrane protein which functions as a chloride channel with several other regulatory properties (5 ,6 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	20	 More than 600 mutations in CFTR have been identified in individuals with CF (7 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The most common mutation, a deletion of 3 bp leading to the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, is found in nearly 70% of CF alleles (8 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	22	CFTR is expressed primarily in exocrine epithelia from the lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and sweat glands (9 -11 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The expression is generally low in these tissues, although a few specific epithelial cell types, such as the serous cells in the submucosal glands of the lung, have relatively high level expression (12 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The mechanisms that govern the level and the cell specific regulation of CFTR expression have been explored but remain poorly understood.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The putative promoter region lies within 3800 bp of the start site of CFTR transcription and supports low level expression of reporter genes in vitro (13 -16 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	26	 CFTR expression can be induced by cAMP (17 ) and suppressed by phorbol ester (18 ,19 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (20 ) demonstrated that the induction of CFTR expression by protein kinase A is mediated by an 8 bp cAMP responsive element upstream from CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (21 ) analyzed the function of an inverted CCAAT element at -132 to -119 upstream from CFTR in detail.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	29	 They showed that transcription factor binding to this element confers both basal and cAMP-induced CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The level of CFTR expression also appears to be related to the state of cellular differentiation (22 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Additional regulatory elements have been shown to lie within this 5'-flanking region as well as within the first CFTR intron (23 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	32	 DNase I hypersensitivity sites have been demonstrated within the 120 kb upstream of CFTR, but no correlation with cell type specific CFTR expression was observed (24 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Taken together, these studies provide little insight into the exact mechanisms that determine the level and specificity of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	34	One novel approach to study CFTR expression is to introduce the entire 230 kb gene and flanking sequences into mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Obstacles to this approach include: (i) obtaining an appropriate vector containing a full-length, human CFTR without deletions, mutations or rearrangements; (ii) maintaining the integrity of CFTR during vector propagation; and (iii) transferring CFTR intact into appropriate mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) provide potential vectors for such a study.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	37	 YACs containing human CFTR were generated soon after the gene was identified (25 ,26 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Although the genetic structure of these YACs has been studied, the functionality of CFTR contained within them has not been established.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	39	The goal of the present study was to determine if two different YACs containing full-length, human CFTR and ~45 or 335 kb of adjacent upstream sequence can produce functional human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) in mammalian cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The analyses that follow demonstrate the functionality of the human CFTR contained within each YAC.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	56	Screening of CHO cell clones for human CFTR was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic DNA using two sets of intron primers, one spanning exon 2 and the other, exon 6a.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These primers were chosen toward the 5'-end of the gene since neor was located beyond the 3'-end of CFTR.

0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	153	This study describes the generation of two clonal CHO cell lines, CS2/C5 and CS1/F2, containing full-length, human CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These cell lines were derived from the fusion of CHO cells with yeast spheroplasts containing two different YACs which include human CFTR and ~75 or 375 kb of adjacent sequences.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on metaphase nuclei to indicate the site of YAC integration.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	156	 A single site of integration on a different CHO chromosome was found in each cell line.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Southern analysis suggested that each clone most likely contains on the order of one copy of human CFTR per CHO cell genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Fiber-FISH suggested the gross structural integrity of the transferred CFTR in both cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The integrity of the integrated CFTR was indicated further by restriction analysis of genomic DNA.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	160	 These results suggested that the majority of human CFTR was grossly intact and correlated with functionalCFTR production, potentially extending the application of Fiber-FISH beyond its current status as a genetic mapping tool (28 ,29 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The Fiber-FISH also suggested that the flanking sequences common to both YACs were present in both cell lines.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Finally, the sequence-tagged site, sL12, located at the extreme 5'-end of yCFTR8-Neo (26 ) was detected in DNA from CS1/F2 cells suggesting that this larger YAC is incorporated in its entirety into the CHO genome (data not shown).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	163	The parental YACs used in these experiments were constructed several years ago (25 ,26 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Although the human CFTR contained in these YACs has been shown to be grossly intact, even after transfer into Chinese hamster fibroblasts (30 ), the functionality of the CFTR has not been established until now.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The present study demonstrates the production of full-length CFTR mRNA and functional protein by both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Human CFTR production in these cell lines implies that the regulatory elements needed for gene expression are contained within these YACs.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The ability of these cells to produce mature and functional protein at the cell surface for more than 15 passages is demonstrated by cAMP-stimulated 36Cl- efflux.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	168	 CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 are distinctive from the other clonal lines generated in this study because their CFTR mRNA can be detected by both RT-PCR and Northern analysis.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	169	 None of the other cell lines created in this study and analyzed by Northern analysis have comparable mRNA transcripts.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	170	The rate of 36Cl- efflux observed in both CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 at early passages is similar to that seen in T84 cells, despite the fact that they have lower CFTR mRNA and protein levels than T84 cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This data supports previous studies in which cAMP-mediated chloride efflux was a sensitive indicator of functional protein without direct correlation with the level of CFTR expression (31 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	172	Ordinarily, YAC gene transfer is carried out in a mammalian cell line in which the gene of interest is endogenously expressed, placing the YAC into an environment likely to be permissive for the human promoter (32 -35 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In contrast, the present study demonstrates YAC-mediated gene transfer into cells lacking endogenous CFTR production (36 ,37 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It is unclear why only human CFTR appears to be functionally expressed when both the endogenous and transferred genes could potentially interact with the same basal transcription factors.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Several aspects of YAC integration may support expression of the transferred human CFTR in these CHO cell clones.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For example, it has been suggested that transferred YACs may retain a chromatin structure that favors expression (38 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	177	 CFTR expression from these YACs may be favored by the requirement that the nearby neor has to be expressed in order for the cells to survive, forcing the adjacent chromatin to remain open.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In addition, the human and hamster genes could have different affinities for DNA binding proteins.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	179	 An alternative explanation is that the hamster CFTR is mutated and cannot produce functional CFTR.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	180	 To better understand the differential expression of the hamster and human genes, it would be useful to directly compare the structure of the two genes.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, this work remains to be done because hamster CFTR has not yet been extensively characterized.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In the present studies, full length human CFTR probes did not clearly cross hybridize with control CHO cells, suggesting there is very little homology between the hamster and human CFTR, or perhaps that the gene is absent in the control CHO line.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	183	The etiology of the unexpectedly high level of human CFTR expression in these CHO cell lines is also unclear.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Each clonal cell line produces mRNA and protein at easily detectable levels.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The FISH and Southern analysis suggest that this level of expression is likely a consequence of CFTR integrated at a unique locus in each cell line at a copy number on the order of one per CHO genome.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In contrast, when the techniques employed in the present study are applied to evaluate CFTR expression in normal diploid human epithelial cells, it is difficult to detect CFTR mRNA (10 ) or protein (S.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Cheng, Genzyme, Framingham, MA, pers.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The level of CFTR expression could be related to a number of factors including the regulatory sequences within the YAC vector, the distance the gene lies from the YAC ends and the integration site in the host genome (32 ,38 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Another potential positive influence on CFTR promoter function is the SV40 enhancer that supports neor expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The SV40 enhancer has been shown to augment CFTR promoter function in reporter gene constructs (15 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	191	 In addition to these factors, the liberation of the gene from a negative regulatory element, possibly downstream, in a region not included in either YAC, could result in higher than expected expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Other CFTR-containing YACs with additional flanking sequences are available (26 ) and could be used to address this issue.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	193	The similar levels of human CFTR expression in CS2/C5 and CS1/F2 cells suggest that the expression is independent of the site of integration.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Such position independent expression is not necessarily expected in cell lines created by YAC transfer.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	195	 It has been postulated that a buffer of DNA sequence might insulate the gene of interest from positional effects at the site of integration (32 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The extensive amount of sequence upstream from CFTR in these YACs could potentially act as a buffer and might account for the similar level of expression seen in the two different clones.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The detailed analysis of more clones derived from each YAC would be necessary to determine how any of these factors contribute to the level of human CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	198	This study demonstrates that the CFTR contained within the YACs used in this study are free of gross rearrangements and are functional.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Furthermore, the expression of the introduced gene indicates that sufficient sequence is present to promote human CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Although this is the first study investigating the function of the full-length, human CFTR contained within YACs, a limited number of studies have documented functional protein production from other human genes transferred to mammalian cells by YAC vectors (34 ,38 -42 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	201	 These cell lines often have appropriate regulation of the transferred genes and have been used to study various aspects of gene expression (38 ,39 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	202	The CFTR-containing YACs and cell lines described in this paper offer several advantages over other model systems for the study of CFTR expression.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Analysis of the role of the intron sequences and the flanking sequences contained within these CFTR-containing YACs may help to elucidate the regulation of CFTR expression in ways not possible when cell lines are created with cDNA constructs (36 ,43 ).
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In addition, the cells in this study do not have a growth disadvantage when compared to the parental CHO cells.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Finally, these YACs can be manipulated in yeast to generate mutations in CFTR or modified to include reporter genes in place of human sequences.
0.4739439.9002671.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thus, these YACs and the cell lines derived from them should be useful tools for the study of CFTR gene expression.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To better understand mechanisms that regulate transcription of CFTR, we examined transcription factors that specifically bind a CFTR CArG-like motif we have previously shown to modulate CFTR expression.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated the CFTR CArG-like motif binds serum response factor both in vitro and in vivo.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Transient co-transfections with various SRF expression vector, including dominant-negative forms and small interfering RNA, demonstrated that SRF significantly increases CFTR transcriptional activity in bronchial epithelial cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Mutagenesis studies suggested that in addition to SRF other co-factors, such as Yin Yang 1 (YY1) previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter, are potentially involved in the CFTR regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here, we show that functional interplay between SRF and YY1 might provide interesting perspectives to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanism of the basal CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Furthermore, the identification of multiple CArG binding sites in highly conserved CFTR untranslated regions, which form specific SRF complexes, provides direct evidence for a considerable role of SRF in the CFTR transcriptional regulation into specialized epithelial lung cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene occurs in a subset of specialized cells of epithelial origin (1 to 3) and is tightly regulated both temporally and spatially (4,5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, no clear mechanism responsible for this regulation has yet been reported in part due to the complexity of the non-coding regions structure of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	13	Despite the absence of a TATA element, the transcription of the CFTR gene may be initiated through several discrete start sites (6,7), including those that are tissue-specific (8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	14	 An intact CCAAT consensus is also required for accurate transcript initiation (9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both basal and cAMP-mediated regulation of CFTR transcription involve a weak cAMP response element (CRE) nucleotide consensus (10,11) in tandem with a consensus inverted CCAAT element or Y box (9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition, CFTR transcription may be modulated by additional overlapping cis-acting elements, including a polymorphic YY1 site, located in the human minimal CFTR promoter (12).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CFTR promoter activity may be enhanced by exogenous transfected NF-B via its binding to the  to 1103 B element (13).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	18	 CFTR expression is also regulated through interactions with factors involved in remodeling of chromatin structure, such as CDP/cut and hGCN5 (14).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	19	Because none of these cis-acting elements confers tissue-specific control of CFTR expression, several studies focused on identifying potential regulatory elements that lie mainly outside the coding region.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Extensive analyses of the chromatin structure identified multiple clusters of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) (15,16), some of which contain tissue-specific enhancer elements (17,18).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Multiple binding sites for a tissue-specific transcription factor, called HNF1, recently identified in various DHS core, modulate likewise CFTR expression (19).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Despite extensive studies, the transcriptional regulatory networks of CFTR expression remain to be unraveled.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	23	Our current model for the regulation of human CFTR expression proposes that multiple transcription factors interact with previously reported polymorphic and composite cis-acting elements encompassing a CArG-like motif (12,20).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), originally defined as the core component of the serum response element (SRE), is found in the 5' region of immediate early response genes, such as c-fos (21), and in many muscle-specific gene promoters (22).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This DNA element binds serum response factor (SRF), highly regulated and interactive transcription factor, which is phylogenetically conserved and belongs to the MADS box family of proteins, with MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens and SRF (23).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Although SRF is particularly enriched in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle lineages (24,25), it is also expressed in a variety of human cell lines from distinct tissue origins (26), and, to a lesser extent, in ectoderm-derived tissue such as gastric epithelium (27).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Interestingly, it has been shown that Drosophila SRF homolog is expressed in a subset of tracheal cells and regulates cytoplasmic outgrowth during terminal branching of the tracheal system (28).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Hence, it has been suggested that SRF plays an essential role in the formation of the respiratory system.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Moreover, it has been recently shown that SRF is involved in myofibroblast differentiation during lung damage (29).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, we hypothesized that trans-acting factors interacting with CArG-like motif, such as SRF, could be important in CFTR expression regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We provided evidence that SRF is expressed in bronchial epithelial cell expressing endogenous CFTR protein.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Through the use of combined gel mobility shift to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we first demonstrated that SRF protein binds, both in vitro and in vivo, the CFTR minimal promoter region spanning the CArG-like motif.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Mutagenic studies and transient co-transfections experiments showed that SRF alone is not sufficient to transactivate the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Upon some mutations of the CFTR-CArG-like element, promoter activity is severely decreased, potentially implying YY1 as a co-repressor.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Given the YY1 well-defined role in the transcriptional regulation of some SRE-dependent promoters (30 to 33), we explored the putative role of YY1 on the CFTR promoter activity and demonstrated functional interplay between this factor and SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Finally, by stringent in silico structural analysis, we identified additional multiple near consensus CArG sites within the highly conserved promoter and intronic regions of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We also documented the existence of SRF-containing protein complexes on numerous predicted CFTR CArG-like elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Taken together, the data obtained classify CFTR as a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation, and open the gate to further investigate how SRF may be involved in the regulation of CFTR gene expression.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Because so far all described CArG-box elements were found in the regulatory regions of immediate early genes (47) and in muscle-specific genes (22), we confirmed our first binding site prediction by using two other algorithms, AliBaba (http://www.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	170	 As shown in Figure 1A, the CFTR-CArG-like element sequence (GC(A/T)6GG) diverges slightly at the 5' from the published SRF consensus sequence (CC(A/T)6GG) (22,37).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, this divergence is similar to that observed in the smooth muscle-gamma-actin promoter which has been demonstrated to bind SRF (48).

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The human CFTR-CArG-like motif is noted above the Cynomolgus sequence.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	182	  To assess the putative functional importance of CFTR-CArG-like binding site, we used an orthogonal approach of deducing regulatory elements by considering orthologous CFTR minimal promoter regions from several mammalian species representing the Primates, Artiodactylia and Lagomorpha orders.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Comparison of human/species homologies was carried out using ClustalW multiple CFTR sequence alignments according to the numerous alignment parameters described previously (49).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Consistent with previous studies (50,51), we showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter is remarkably conserved across the orders studied (Figure 1B, right panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	185	 We found that the CFTR-CArG-like element is conserved within all the Primates species studied and also within the pig while, within the sheep, cow and rabbit species, some substitutions occur in the middle of the CArG-like motif (Figure 1B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	186	 These data are consistent with previous CFTR promoter phylogenetic work that identified two types of regulatory elements: some are conserved between species, such as a non-consensus CRE at positions  to 0.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	189	Bronchial epithelial expression of SRF Because we could not previously identify SRF binding to the CFTR CArG-like element, even though an anti-SRF antibody had been used (12), we asked whether SRF, mainly described as highly expressed in muscle cells, was also present in epithelial cell lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	190	 To measure the expression levels of SRF mRNAs, we used a RT to PCR-based procedure previously described by Davis et al.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	191	 As reverse-transcribed control, the Hypoxanthine PhosphoRybosyl-Transferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene was amplified.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Amplification of SRF from bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts yielded a fragment of the same size, 651 bp (Figure 2A), as that of the full-length SRF transcript produced by RT to PCR from human hearts (52).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The 453 bp band corresponding to SRF lacking exon 5 (SRF5) was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line (Figure 2A).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	194	 To ensure that these bands were not the result of a PCR artifact or genomic contamination of samples, negative controls such as exclusion of RT or RNA during cDNA synthesis were included in each assay.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	195	 As expected, no PCR product appeared when either RT or the template was omitted (Figure 2A).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Densitometric analysis revealed that bronchial epithelial cells contained an appreciable amount of SRF mRNA.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Nuclear extracts from A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells were electrophoresed and then assayed by western blotting with anti-SRF antibody reported to recognize all four isoforms of the protein (52).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	198	 As shown in Figure 2B, we found that robust expression of a 67 kDa band, that based on molecular mass, corresponds to full-length SRF (SRF-FL) in all of the cell lines examined.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Consistent wit RT to PCR analysis, a 57 kDa band corresponding to SRF5 was only detected in the C2C12 myoblast line.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	200	 As a control, we checked the ss-actin levels (Figure 2B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Densitometric analysis of western blot revealed no apparent difference in the expression level of SRF proteins between the myoblasts and epithelial cells (Figure 2B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In subsequent western blot analyses in which parallel blots were probed with only the secondary antibody, no band was detected (data not shown), thus confirming that these bands are indeed specific for SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	203	 As further evidence, A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells express relatively large amounts of SRF, the cell lines were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	204	 A similar staining pattern was noted in the bronchial epithelial cells and myoblasts (Figure 2C, rows A to C).

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	225	  SRF binds the CFTR-CArG-like element Because the CArG box is not only found in the regulatory regions of many muscle-specific genes but also located at the center of other SREs (54) and forms the core binding site for SRF (55), we have attempted to determine whether or not SRF binds to the CFTR-CArG-like element sequence.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We performed two series of bandshift experiments.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	227	 First, we incubated the 32P-labelLed WT oligonucleotide corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like element sequence (as indicated in Table 2) with bacterially expressed SRF.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	228	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 3), EMSA revealed a recombinant SRF to WT duplex.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 5), bands defined as the CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared when 100-fold molar excess of specific competitor containing the consensus SRE motif, derived from human c-fos promoter (56), was added.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In contrast, competition by an irrelevant oligonucleotide (noted UC) did not appear to significantly alter the complex suggesting specificity of binding (lane 6).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To confirm precisely the identity of protein binding in the minimal CFTR promoter (from  to 121 to  to 83 bp), bacterially expressed SRF was preincubated with anti-SRF antibody before incubation with 32P-labelled probe.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	232	 As shown in Figure 3A (lane 4), bands corresponding to CFTR-CArG-like-SRF complex disappeared, and more slowly migrating bands appeared when anti-SRF antibody was added.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	233	 To verify the antibody specificity, control experiments were performed either in the absence of the SRF protein (Figure 3A, lane 7) or in the presence of an irrelevant antibody (Figure 3A, lane 8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These results demonstrate that the CFTR-CArG-like element is a bona fide SRF-binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Second, we performed additional EMSA with the WT oligonucleotide, as main binding target, and nuclear extracts from both epithelial and muscle cells (Figure 3B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	236	 While three nucleoprotein complexes were formed from nuclear extracts of Beas2B and C2C12 cells on the WT probe, five complexes were detected from A549 cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Each nuclear protein complex was designated by an upper case relative to nuclear lysate followed by a Roman numeral indicating its position into the gels.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The binding specificity of the different complexes was examined by competition analyses with both specific and non-specific unlabeled oligonucleotides (Figure 3B, lanes 2 to 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Although a few non-specific binding activities were observed, complexes BII, BIII, AIII, AV, CI, CII and CIII were efficiently competed with an excess of both WT and c-fos SRE unlabeled specific competitors indicating binding specificity (Figure 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Control experiments including an irrelevant oligonucleotide did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles (Figure 3B, lanes 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	241	 To evaluate whether the SRF protein contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the CFTR-derived SRF site, we used a specific antibody against the SRF protein.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Although the incubation with the anti-SRF antibody apparently failed to give any discrete supershift from various sources of nuclear proteins, a significant decrease of specific complexes was observed (Figure 3B, lanes 6).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This effect seemed to be specific because none of these nuclear protein complexes was supershifted or abolished when a non-specific antibody was used (Figure 3B, lanes 7).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Control experiments containing only the anti-SRF antiserum and the radiolabeled WT oligonucleotide did not reveal any binding activities (Figure 3B, lanes 8).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In addition, supershift assays performed with the radiolabeled c-fos SRE oligonucleotide instead of the WT probe showed that bands corresponding to SRE to SRF complex disappeared and more slowly migrating bands appeared (Figure 3B, lane 10).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The absence of supershift for specific WT binding complexes (Figure 3D, lanes 6) may be explained if the epitope recognized by the anti-SRF antibody is part of (or located near) the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Antibody binding would compete DNA binding, resulting in a significant decrease or total disappearance of CArG-like complexes rather than in supershifted complexes.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Alternatively, if the interaction between the CFTR-CArG-like DNA-binding site and the SRF protein is insufficiently strong, it could be not as stable as the one observed with the SRE probe (Figure 3B, lane 10) to be detected as a supershift in gel retardation assays.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	249	 On the one hand, other DNA-binding proteins that are potentially part of this complex could interfere with the antibody's access to SRF protein.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	265	  SRF binds the CArG-like motif of the CFTR minimal promoter within intact chromatin under physiological conditions Although there is extensive evidence that SRF can bind to CArG-like elements in in vitro assays and that it is involved in transcriptional regulation through CArG elements in reporter assays in cultured cells with a typical epithelioid morphology (53), there is a lack of direct evidence for involvement of SRF in transcription of the endogenous CFTR gene within the context of intact chromatin.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	266	 To directly address whether SRF also binds in vivo, ChIP was carried out in bronchial epithelial cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	267	 For this purpose, DNA-binding proteins of Beas2B epithelial cells were covalently linked to genomic DNA by treatment of the cells with formaldehyde.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Surprisingly, the activity of the minimal CFTR promoter in C2C12 cells was 4 to 5.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	288	5 times higher than that observed in Beas2B and A549 cells, respectively.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Although the expression of the CFTR protein was previously evidenced in some muscle cells (57 to 59), it has never been investigated in mouse C2C12 myoblasts.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Therefore, we investigated the CFTR expression at both mRNA and protein levels.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	291	 To examine CFTR mRNA expression in mouse myoblasts (C2C12), total RNA isolated from epithelial and non-epithelial cells was analyzed via RT to PCR with CFTR-specific primers (Table 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	292	 As shown in Figure 5B, while no PCR product for CFTR was seen with COS-7 cells, the expected CFTR amplified product was obtained for both epithelial (A549 and Beas2B) and muscular (C2C12) cell lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	293	 No product was detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase or RNA (noted No RT or No RNA, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Although the HPRT PCR control showed non-equivalent amounts of cDNA used in the different PCRs, densitometric analysis revealed that C2C12 cells contained an appreciable amount of CFTR mRNA.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Further determination of CFTR expression in C2C12 myoblasts was conducted by western blot analysis (Figure 5C).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Caco-2 cells were used as positive control and COS-7 as negative control.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	297	 As shown in Figure 5C, while mature fully glycosylated band C CFTR was observed in A549, Beas2B and C2C12 cells, the core glycosylated band B CFTR occurred at the same molecular mass only in a subset of cell lines, indicative of potential variations in glycosylation process.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	298	 To rule out the possibility of antibodies cross-reactivity or non-specific labeling, indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed with another anti-CFTR antibody, L12B4 (Figure 5D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	299	 As expected, the Caco-2 cell line used as a positive control showed strong immunoreactivity for CFTR protein (Figure 5D, row D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In contrast, and as expected, COS-7 cells used as negative control did not stain with this anti-CFTR antibody (Figure 5D, row E).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	301	 No staining was detected when the primary antibody was omitted (Figure 5D, row F).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The comparison of immunofluorescence images between epithelial (Figure 5D, row A, B and D) and muscular (Figure 5D, row C) cells provides evidence that CFTR is significantly expressed in C2C12 myoblasts.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, because the indirect immunofluorescence experiments were performed in permeabilized cells, they do not distinguish between CFTR that is located in the apical membrane and CFTR that is located in a vesicular pool just beneath the apical membrane.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	304	 These findings, together with the transcriptional activities presented above, suggest that the minimal CFTR promoter might contain tissue-specific enhancer(s) as well as repressive cis-regulatory elements that have the ability to mitigate the activity of the CFTR promoter between epithelial and non-epithelial lineages.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Because CF affects mainly epithelial tissues and Beas2B consistently yielded higher enhancer activity than A549, we restricted subsequent studies to this bronchial epithelial cell line.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	331	  Effects of SRF on the proximal CFTR promoter To assess whether SRF protein might affect CFTR transcriptional regulation, we took two related approaches.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	332	 First, we co-transfected either exogenous full-length SRF or truncated SRF mutants with the wild-type CFTR minimal promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Second, we utilized a siRNA approach to ask whether a reduction in endogenous SRF levels could affect basal CFTR activation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Luciferase assays were carried out in Beas2B cells using the indicated SRF expression vectors and the WT-pGL3luciferase reporter construct (Figure 6B, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter gene was used as positive control because its transcriptional activity is highly dependent on SRF binding (Figure 6B, right panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	336	 As expected, while this synthetic promoter containing several consensus SREs was markedly and significantly activated ( > 2-fold) by forced expression of full-length SRF protein (pHiv-SRF) (Figure 6B, right panel), truncated SRF mutants either containing only the amino acids 133 to 264 corresponding to DNA-binding domain of SRF (pHiv-DBD-SRF), or deleted of amino acids 153 to 165, an essential part for the DNA binding (pHiv-DN-SRF) induced modest but significant decrease of SRE activity (10% and 30%, respectively).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	337	 When these SRF expression vectors were transiently co-transfected with the WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter construct, the trans-activator effect of SRF was notably reduced.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Indeed, overexpression of full-length and dominant-negative (pHiv-DN-SRF) SRF proteins resulted in 50% increased and 30% decreased of luciferase activity, respectively (Figure 6B, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Unexpectedly and inconsistent with previous study (60), the pHiv-DBD-SRF construct induced 40% increase of the WT-pGL3 luciferase activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	340	 This results disparity may be explained by the fact that the c-fos promoter study (60) assessed the DBD to SRF domain activity via microinjection of corresponding truncated SRF polypeptide.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Perhaps, the best explanation for this increased activity is that the DNA-binding domain of SRF, also called MADS box, is sufficient for transcriptional activation of some SRF-dependent genes because it mediates interactions with accessory co-activators (61).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	342	 These results suggest that neither of the regions outside the MADS box, N- or C-terminal, appear essential for transactivation of the CFTR promoter by SRF.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	363	  To further establish the role of SRF in mediating the increase in CFTR gene transcription, we performed siRNA experiments (Figure 6C).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	364	 To demonstrate the efficacy of specific SRF siRNA construct, Beas2B cells were co-transfected with either control or SRF siRNA plasmids and western blots were performed to analyze levels of SRF in these cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Densitometric analysis of western blot showed that endogenous SRF levels were strongly reduced in the presence of the SRF siRNA plasmid (Figure 6C, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Then, control and SRF siRNA plasmids were co-transfected into Beas2B cells with either the WT-pGL3 or the 3XSRE luciferase reporter construct.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	367	 As shown in Figure 6C (right panel), reduction of endogenous SRF protein level decreased the activity of both wild-type CFTR promoter and 3XSRE-fos TATA-Luciferase reporter constructs by 25%.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	368	Taken together, these findings indicate that endogenous SRF into bronchial epithelial cells normally function as transcriptional coactivator for the CArG-mediated transactivation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	369	 However, we found that SRF activated the CFTR promoter less well than the SRE-containing synthetic promoter, suggesting that the CArG-like element mediated CFTR transcriptional activation probably required other bridging or co-activating factors.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	370	The CArG-like element contained in the human minimal CFTR promoter is important but not sufficient for basal transcriptional activity in Beas2B cells To assess the transcriptional relevance of the CArG-like binding sequence of CFTR minimal promoter, mutants were performed to create either more consensus CArG element or degenerated motif (Table 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	371	 We used the D upper-case and the C upper-case to designate the Degenerated CArG motifs and the Consensus CArG elements, respectively.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	372	 To ensure the efficacy of mutations in abrogating transcription factor binding, we first performed a series of EMSA experiments with each CArG mutant and the WT probe (Table 2).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	373	 As expected, based on the sequence analysis, the mutations resulting in more degenerated CArG motifs (D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutants) completely abolished SRF-binding activity (Figure 7A, lanes 1 to 4), when we compared with SRF-WT complexes (Figure 7A, lane 5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	374	 In addition, the probes containing more consensus CArG boxes (C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 mutants) bound SRF more strongly in nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B (Figure 7A, lanes 6 to 10).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Inclusion of an anti-SRF antibody partially abolished SRF-binding activity and resulted in a slower mobility band, confirming the identity of the binding protein (Figure 7A, lane 11).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Then, minimal CFTR promoter constructs bearing the same consensus and disrupted CArG boxes were tested in a transient transfection assays in Beas2B cells (Figure 7B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Compared with luciferase activity resulting from the WT-pGL3 construct, variable increases in reporter activity are observed when D1, D2, D3 and D4 mutant constructs, with disrupted CArG motif, were transiently transfected.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	378	 On the other hand, mutations that create more consensus CArG element result in either reducing or increasing in the transcriptional activity (Figure 7B).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Consistent with the preceding gel-shift results revealing an uncharacterized protein/DNA complex with slightly slower mobility and variable intensity compared with the SRF to DNA complex, these finer mutagenesis studies suggest that both co-activators and co-repressors might interact with the studied promoter sequences.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Taken together, these data demonstrated that the CFTR-CArG-like element alone is not sufficient to confer basal transcriptional activation of the CFTR gene.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Sequence analysis of CArG boxes and their immediate flanking sequences showed that C1, C3 and C4 constructs contain consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors, in addition to SRF, including the transcription factor YY1.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	391	 These findings with previous work (12) have particularly evoked our interest to examine the role of YY1 in SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	392	In a first set of experiments, we evaluated whether the YY1 factor contributes to the formation of nucleoprotein complexes interacting with the WT, C1, C3 and C4 radiolabeled probes.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	393	 As shown in Figure 8A, incubation with specific anti-YY1 antibody resulted in either a significant decrease or total disappearance of some complexes normally formed between the CArG boxes and a component of Beas2B nuclear extracts, establishing DNA binding between YY1 and the sequences tested.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	394	 As expected, control experiment performed with radiolabeled probe, D2, devoid of any YY1 binding site and the anti-YY1 antiserum did not reveal any change in electrophoretic profiles indicating specificity of the YY1 binding.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Thus, these EMSAs demonstrated that the CFTR-CArG-like (WT probe) and more consensus CArG elements (C1  <  C3  <  C4) served as binding site for at least two distinct nuclear factors, namely SRF and YY1 from bronchial epithelial cells.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	409	  Then, to determine whether the interaction of these two factors with their target DNA (CFTR-CArG-like or more consensus CArG sequence) was either mutually inclusive or exclusive, EMSAs were conducted using bacterially expressed SRF and nuclear extracts prepared from Beas2B cells transfected with a YY1 expression vector as a source of YY1 DNA-binding activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	410	 As shown in Figure 8B, the YY1-binding complex was significantly reduced by increasing SRF binding activity, suggesting their mutually exclusive binding to CArG sites.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	411	Consistent with other studies (32,62), these EMSAs results suggested as a working hypothesis that both SRF and YY1 likely act as functional competitors in the CFTR promoter activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	412	 Since the minimal CFTR promoter is activated by SRF and knowing from previous studies (30 to 33) that YY1 negatively regulates some promoter containing CArG elements, it seemed logical to first assess whether YY1 could also repress the CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	413	 We asked whether CArG-like-binding site in the CFTR promoter acted as negative regulatory elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Several CFTR promoter reporter constructs containing either CArG-like (namely, WT) or consensus CArG element (C1, C3 and C4) were co-transfected with SRF and/or YY1 expression vectors into Beas2B cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	415	 As shown in Figure 8C, while co-transfections with SRF alone resulted in 1.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	416	5- to 2-fold luciferase activation, forced expression of YY1 protein caused a strong decrease in reporter activities (50 to 75% of the control luciferase value).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Therefore, we wanted to determine the functional relationship of both factors in the CFTR activity regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Transient co-transfections analysis of combination of protein expression vectors showed that over-expression of SRF either did not restore (Figure 8C, panel with the WT and C4 reporter constructs) or only very slightly raised the YY1-repressed reporter activities (Figure 8C, panel with the C1 and C3 reporter constructs).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	419	 These findings are consistent with results obtained from co-transfections performed with the YY1 expression vector alone and previous alpha-actin promoter studies (30 to 33), in which YY1 acted as a strong repressor.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Taken together, these data suggested functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through DNA-binding competition.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Four CArG binding sites were found in the CFTR promoter regions, and seven in the intronic regions.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Then, to confirm the computational predictions, we used several approaches.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	425	 First, the nucleotide regions harboring these predicted cis-acting elements were analyzed for conservation in the cow, as physiologically relevant transcription factor binding sites are frequently conserved in the non-coding regions of orthologous genes (49,63).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Second, the SRF-binding sites were tested by EMSAs and also for one of them by ChIP.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	443	 We provided evidence that the majority of in silico predicted CArG motifs form specific DNA to protein complexes with bacterially expressed SRF protein (Figure 9C, left panel).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	444	 We also demonstrated by using Beas2B nuclear extracts and supershift assays that some of these CArG elements bound in vitro SRF protein (Figure 9C, right panel, lanes 1, 3, 7 and 9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	445	 Finally, additional ChIP experiments indicated that the only tested CArG element, located at  to 2373 bp in the CFTR promoter, bound SRF in chromatin from intact cultured Beas2B cells (Figure 9D, lane 1).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	446	 Collectively, these findings support the concept that SRF may play a key role in the CFTR expression regulation via binding to multiple CFTR CArG elements.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	447	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   While great strides have been made in CFTR research with emphasis on the structure and function of this protein, only incremental advances have been achieved in the field of transcriptional regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	448	 In our previous works (12,20), we have identified a polymorphic CArG-like site and showed that a naturally occurring sequence variation in this motif may enhance the basal CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	449	 The goal of the present study was to better characterize the human CFTR promoter region encompassing the CArG-like element.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	450	Comparisons of nucleotide sequences of this CFTR promoter region in eight mammalian species representing three different orders (Primates, Artiodactyla and Lagomorpha) revealed high levels of conservation of the minimal promoter region, as described previously (64).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	451	 However, the CArG-like element (GC(T/A)6GG), which does not conform to the authentic CArG box (CC(T/A)6GG), is absent from three species (sheep, cow and rabbit).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	452	 Even though this motif occurs in only a subset of the input sequences, it does not necessarily mean that it is of no functional importance.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	453	 Instances of cis-regulatory elements being species-specific have been already reported for the CFTR gene (50).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	454	 More generally, it is well known that some transcription factors can tolerate more than one type of nucleotide at a given position of the binding site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Instances of substitutions in both the central core of the CArG element and the highly conserved contact points for SRF, at the terminal ends, not impairing SRF binding have been previously reported (48,65 to 68).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Taken together, these data support the notion that the CFTR-CArG-like element has possible important implication in the CFTR transcriptional regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	457	Interestingly, analysis of SRF expression has revealed relatively high expression levels of SRF protein in the bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 2), as shown in other differentiated epithelial cells (27).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	458	 Accumulating evidence supports the concept that SRF could contribute to the CFTR expression regulation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	459	 In addition to regulating growth-responsive genes and numerous muscle-specific genes (22,69), SRF is also described as a key trans-binding factor in various important physiological events.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	460	 For example, SRF has been shown to regulate pulmonary development in Drosophila (28), to promote both re-epithelialization and muscular structure restoration during gastric ulcer healing (70) and more recently to be involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-targeted gene (67).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Therefore, it was relevant to examine the potential role of SRF on the CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	462	In the present study, we demonstrated that CFTR-CArG-like element forms specific DNA to protein complexes that include SRF protein as part of the complex, in vitro and in vivo (Figures 3 and 4).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	463	 We have investigated the expression driven by the proximal human CFTR promoter in a pGL3 construct in both epithelial and myoblasts lines.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Results of our transient transfections of 3XSRE-fos TATA and WT-pGL3 luciferase reporter genes showed that the human minimal CFTR promoter encompassing a CArG-like motif was sufficient to drive the expression in both cell types (Figure 5).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	465	 Consistent with other studies showing CFTR expression in smooth muscle tissue (71,72), our results demonstrated that the human CFTR minimal promoter had the ability to drive the expression in muscle lineages.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Our transient co-transfections analyses performed with full-length and dominant-negative SRF forms expression vectors, and also specific SRF siRNA constructs (Figure 6, panels B and C) provide the first evidence for a positive role of the SRF protein in the regulation of the human CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	467	 However, the SRF-induced CFTR transactivation, though significant, is relatively modest.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	468	 These data with the results of finer mutagenesis studies presented in Figure 7 support the concept that SRF alone is not sufficient to drive the basal expression of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	469	 As suggested by other previous studies (73 to 75), it is likely that additional factors might be required to optimally drive the CFTR promoter, as well as to specify the cell-type-restricted expression.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	470	 Since YY1 was previously shown to bind the CFTR promoter (12) and a subset of SREs serve as binding sites for YY1 (30 to 33), we first evaluated this candidate in the SRF-mediated CFTR transcriptional activity.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	471	 The data analysis suggests a functional antagonism between SRF and YY1 through binding competition for the CFTR-CArG-like box.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	472	 However, the analysis of combinatorial co-transfection studies, presented in Figure 8C, suggests that the functional interplay between SRF and YY1, alone, is not sufficient to account for basal CFTR transcriptional activation.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	473	 Further studies will be necessary to determine whether another player might be involved in this functional interplay and accounted for the basal transcriptional CFTR activity observed in the Beas2B bronchial epithelial cells.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	474	Interestingly, we showed that, in addition to the CArG-like element defined in the minimal promoter of the CFTR gene, there are three CArG motifs located at the 5' end of the gene and seven are present in the intronic regions (Figure 9).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	475	 We also evidenced SRF binding to CArG elements of the endogenous CFTR gene in the context of intact chromatin (Figures 4 and 9D).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Although the role of these more distal CArG boxes has yet to be assessed, these findings are of major importance, since it has been shown that optimal activity of the SRF-dependent target genes may require a number of CArG boxes, including those that are defined in the intronic region (66,67,76).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Moreover, as already suggested for the -actin promoters (32,74), perhaps the presence multiple CArG elements in the CFTR gene with cooperative binding events might be essential for SRF to prevent YY1 from binding to the CFTR promoter.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	478	 Clearly, further studies are needed to directly investigate the role of these multiple CArG elements in transcriptional regulation of the CFTR gene.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	479	Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that the human CFTR promoter is a novel SRF target gene, subject to modest but significant SRF activation partially due to functional antagonism between YY1 and SRF through mutually exclusive DNA-binding activities of YY1 versus SRF to the CFTR-CArG-like site.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	480	A critical question is, thus, how might SRF contribute to orchestrating cell-restricted and context-dependent programs of CFTR gene expression? Our findings and investigations to date clearly indicate the presence of several different underlying mechanisms of SRF-dependent transcriptional activation, as represented in Figure 10.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	481	 These might include association of SRF with a variety of cell-restricted co-factors (noted in gray bubbles, Figure 10), such as MRTF-A highly expressed in epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, colon and testis, and MRTF-B also expressed in smooth muscle cells (77), ternary complex factors, such as p62 and SAP-1 (25,78) and remodeling chromatin co-factors in an HAT-dependent manner, such as the CREB-binding protein (79).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	482	 In addition, it is well known that binding of SRF to the CArG box induces an acute bend in the DNA and that this bending may vary with changing base compositions across the CArG box (80).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	483	 Such bending can probably facilitate interactions with other proteins already involved in the CFTR expression regulation, such as NF-B (13) and C/EBP (9) and described as interacting with SRF (81).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	484	 Finally, the Ras-related GTPases family (rac, RhoA and cdc42) might have a critical role in the activation of SRF (82).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	485	 Indeed, it is reported that RhoA-induced SRF activation occurs through a phenomenon of  actin treadmilling  restricted to CArG-dependent genes that do not have adjacent ETS-binding sites (e.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	486	 smooth muscle cell restricted CArG genes) (83,84).
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	487	 Moreover, it has been shown that the activation of SRF may be mediated by the NF-B and C/EBP transcription factors (81).

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	489	 In this model, arrows and bubbles marked in gray indicate multiple potential SRF-mediated regulation pathways, such as protein to protein interaction and potential induction by the Ras-related GTPases cascades.
0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	490	 Blue and pink bubbles indicate trans-factors identified in this study that contribute to the basal CFTR transcriptional activity.

0.44163495.16170155.html.plaintext.txt	492	  These data provide the foundation for further studies on the regulation of CFTR and will unable the rational design of further functional studies, including various strategies aiming to further dissect the different regulation pathways.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   The major disease-causing mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508), which adversely affects processing and plasma membrane targeting of CFTR.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Under conditions predicted to stabilize protein folding, F508 CFTR is capable of trafficking to the plasma membrane and retains cAMP-regulated anion channel activity.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Overexpression is one factor that increases CFTR trafficking; therefore, we hypothesized that expression of a domain mimic of the first nucleotide-binding fold (NBF1) of CFTR, i.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	7	, the site of F508, may be sufficient to overwhelm the quality control process or otherwise stabilize F508 CFTR and thereby restore cAMP-stimulated anion secretion.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In epithelial cells expressing recombinant F508 human (h)CFTR, expression of wild-type NBF1 increased the amount of both core-glycosylated and mature protein to a greater extent than expression of F508 NBF1.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Expression of wild-type NBF1 in the F508 hCFTR cells increased whole cell Cl to  current density to 50% of that in cells expressing wild-type hCFTR.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Expression of NBF1 in polarized epithelial monolayers from a F508/F508 cystic fibrosis mouse (MGEF) restored cAMP-stimulated transepithelial anion secretion but not in monolayers from a CFTR-null mouse (MGEN).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Restoration of anion secretion was sustained in NBF1-expressing MGEF for  > 30 passages, whereas MGEN corrected with hCFTR progressively lost anion secretion capability.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We conclude that expression of a NBF1 domain mimic may be useful for correction of the F508 CFTR protein trafficking defect in cystic fibrosis epithelia.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	14	THE MAJOR DISEASE-CAUSING mutation of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508) in the predicted cytoplasmic domain known as the first nucleotide binding fold (NBF1).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Approximately 70% of CF patients are homozygous for the F508 cftr, and  > 90% carry at least one F508 cftr allele (compound heterozygotes) (11).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Nascent wild-type human (h)CFTR is translated and core-glycosylated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A fraction of the core-glycosylated hCFTR protein (25 to 40%; Refs.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	18	 36 and 48) is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation is further modified to form mature hCFTR that is targeted to the plasma membrane (5).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	19	 There, the wild-type hCFTR functions as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel and serves a number of transport functions, including regulation of other ion transport proteins and membrane recycling phenomena (2, 8).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In contrast to wild-type hCFTR, nearly all of F508 hCFTR is retained in the ER in its core-glycosylated form and sorted to the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway instead of the Golgi apparatus (5, 25).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It is believed that improper folding of the mutant protein is recognized by proteins comprising a cellular "quality control" mechanism that retains misfolded proteins for degradation (44).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Chaperone proteins are also involved in the processing of hCFTR and at least two proteins, HSP70 and calnexin, bind F508 hCFTR with greater avidity than wild-type hCFTR (39).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The process of recognition by the quality control machinery and the conformation of the misfolded F508 hCFTR have not been elucidated.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In epithelia homozygous for the F508 mutation, retention and degradation of the mutant hCFTR essentially eliminates the capacity for cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion secretion, and it is believed that this deficit is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the disease (38).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	25	Defective processing of F508 hCFTR is at least partially reversible.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Studies in cells expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and tissues cultured from transgenic F508 murine (m)CFTR mice have shown that a fraction of the mutant protein undergoes biosynthetic maturation when cells are grown at subphysiological temperatures (26 degrees C) (13).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Studies in which F508 hCFTR-expressing cells were treated with "chemical chaperones" such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or organic cellular osmolytes such as myo-inositol and betaine have also found increased maturation of F508 hCFTR, a result that was attributed to stabilization of the mutant protein (1, 3, 22, 52).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Overexpression of the mutant protein either by transfection or by treatment with butyrate results in trafficking of F508 hCFTR to the plasma membrane (4, 40).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The above observations have important therapeutic implications because F508 hCFTR in the plasma membrane retains its capacity as a cyclic nucleotide-regulated anion channel (13).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Studies in cell-free systems indicate that stimulated F508 hCFTR may have channel kinetics similar to wild-type hCFTR (23, 31, 42), whereas on-cell patch studies measure reduced channel kinetic activity compared with wild-type hCFTR (12, 20, 24).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Even if F508 CFTR has reduced function and shorter membrane residence (32), previous studies suggest that only a small amount (10 to 15%) of F508 CFTR activity in the membrane is required to restore epithelial function and moderate disease (15, 26).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Combined with recent pharmacological studies showing that F508 hCFTR channel activity can be significantly enhanced by treatment with compounds such as 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPX), genistein, or class III phosphodiesterase inhibitors (28), it is clear that correcting F508 hCFTR trafficking is a viable strategy for treating CF.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	33	Recent studies have shown that expression of polypeptides representing the structural domain of a protein (i.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	34	, "domain mimics") can predictably alter posttranslational processing of the protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Expression of a minigene encoding the carboxy terminus of human ether-a-go-go-related gene was shown to rescue a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant from misprocessing (29).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In another study, a 6-mer peptide mimic of the reactive center loop of 1-antitrypsin was used to block pathological polymerization of the Z variant mutation of the protein (35).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	37	 With regard to CFTR, expression of a polypeptide representing the NBF1 plus the regulatory "R" domain of hCFTR was shown to inhibit activity of ENaC, the epithelial Na+ channel reputedly regulated by CFTR (45).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because the NBF1 domain of hCFTR is the location of F508 as well as several other processing mutants (46), the NBF1 domain itself may serve as a "checkpoint" for recognition by the cellular quality control machinery or, alternatively, may function in a critical intramolecular interaction that stabilizes hCFTR structure within the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Therefore, we hypothesized that expression of the NBF1 domain may be sufficient to increase F508 CFTR activity in epithelial cells.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The NBF1 domain of CFTR is well conserved among mammalian species (17), and in the mouse, deletion of F508 results in a mCFTR processing defect that recapitulates the fundamental cellular defect of F508 homozygous CF patients (16, 50).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the present study, both heterologous cell systems expressing recombinant F508 hCFTR and epithelial monolayers from a F508 CFTR homozygous mouse were used to test the hypothesis that expression of a NBF1 domain mimic increases trafficking F508 CFTR and restores cAMP-stimulated anion secretion.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This change is consistent with previous demonstrations that expression of NBF1 yields a transmembrane configuration of the peptide and an increase in the basal halide permeability in mammalian cell lines (7, 19).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, similar to our findings with the NBF1-expressing MGEN cells, expression of only the NBF1 domain did not result in cAMP-regulated anion permeability.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	183	 In the present study, restoration of cAMP-regulated anion secretion required NBF1 coexpression in F508 CFTR-expressing epithelial cells.

0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	187	 With regard to CFTR, exogenous copies of the R domain have been shown to interact with full-length CFTR and modify gating behavior of its channel activity (34).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Domain mimics of CFTR and the integral membrane protein syntaxin 1A were used to modify channel activity and demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction (37).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Furthermore, peptide mimics have been used to demonstrate binding interactions between NBF1 and the R domain of CFTR, which could be partially disrupted by introduction of the F508 mutation (6).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	190	Given the findings of the present study and previous observations with expression of recombinant F508 CFTR (4, 40), at least two mechanisms can be postulated that would result in increased processing of F508 CFTR beyond the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	191	 First, expression of recombinant NBF1 may overwhelm the quality control system that is involved in retention and degradation of the mutant protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	192	 A similar process could be postulated for the plasma membrane appearance of F508 hCFTR when the mutant protein is overexpressed in heterologous cell systems (4, 40).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This mechanism would predict competitive binding for, perhaps specific, chaperone proteins or proteases, thereby allowing escape of mutant protein from the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, some evidence weakens the case for this proposed mechanism.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Our measures of protein expression in the C127 cells indicated that clones expressing wild-type NBF1 were more likely to have greater expression of the fully processed F508 CFTR compared with clones expressing the F508 NBF1 peptide (Fig.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	196	 This seems contrary to the prediction that F508 NBF1 would be more efficacious in competing for quality control proteins.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Furthermore, although it is possible that the concentration of the recombinant NBF1 at the quality control binding site(s) far exceeds that needed to discern differences between the two domain mimics, our estimates of NBF1 peptide concentration ( < 5 ng/ microl in cell pellets, as based on detection of the flag epitope with M2 monoclonal antibody) are well below the millimolar concentrations that are typically necessary to inhibit proteases with chemical inhibitors (25, 49).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The second potential mechanism by which NBF1 expression may lead to increased processing of F508 CFTR is that coexpression of additional NBF1 peptides may bind immature F508 CFTR and stabilize its structure in the ER.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	199	 For example, peptide interaction with the R domain of F508 CFTR may mask a site on the misfolded protein that is recognized by the quality control machinery, or additional copies of NBF1 may temporarily interact with F508 CFTR to catalyze a folding reaction that results in properly folded protein.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Given recent evidence that mature CFTR protein may dimerize in the plasma membrane (51), it seems plausible that cooperation between different CFTR monomers may be necessary for correct folding and that this interaction may be mimicked by the NBF1 domain peptides.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	201	Although the precise mechanism resulting in increased expression of F508 CFTR at the plasma membrane using coexpression of NBF1 peptides remains speculative, the significant aspect of the present study is that it suggests a refinement for therapeutic approaches to correcting F508 CFTR processing.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	202	 One major drawback to the use of viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus 2 for gene therapy is that the packaging capacity of the virus is limited, which, with a large gene like CFTR, leaves little capacity for promoter sequences (14).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Thus modification of the strategy to instead transfect only the NBF1 domain is attractive because the small size of the construct (0.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	204	5 kb) would improve packaging efficiency.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Furthermore, two biological advantages of using NBF1 domain transduction as therapy can be envisioned.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	206	 First, the expression of F508 CFTR is driven by its endogenous promoter, which may avoid the consequences of CFTR overexpression on the epithelium, e.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	207	, reduced cell proliferation potential (41).
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	208	 A second advantage is that the NBF1 peptide is less likely to be toxic than the full-length channel protein when inadvertently expressed in nontarget tissues.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The NBF1 construct fused to a protein transduction domain (43) may also be useful for peptide therapy, especially if the smallest effective subunit of NBF1 can be defined.
0.42343527.15028554.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Thus, on the basis of the observations in the present study, the therapeutic approach to correcting the basic protein-processing defect of F508 CFTR should be refined to focus on NBF1 domain mimics that alter trafficking of the mutant protein.

0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This regulation commonly occurs by either affecting the activity of an individual transport process and/or the number of transport entities in the plasma membrane.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The activity of many ion channels is regulated by voltage, by extracellular ligands, or by intracellular signal transduction mechanisms (6).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Thus many ion channels can be easily switched on and off to match the needs of a rapidly changing physiological process.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	9	 CFTR is an excellent example of a highly regulated Cl channel (2).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The activity of CFTR is controlled by the coordination of two processes, phosphorylation of several sites primarily within the regulatory domain followed by ATP binding and hydrolysis by the nucleotide binding domains.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These two processes act together to both switch on and regulate channel opening (3).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	12	In contrast, in some clear-cut cases, once inserted into the plasma membrane the activity of a variety of transporters is difficult to regulate.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In those cases, the most effective way to modulate transepithelial transport is to alter the number of transporters in the plasma membrane.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For example, it is well known that mature aquaporin water channels move water in an unregulated fashion (1).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To modulate overall transepithelial water transport such as in the renal collecting duct, vesicles containing aquaporin 2 water channels are rapidly inserted into the plasma membrane following activation by antidiuretic hormone (8).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The specific question addressed by this article in focus is whether exocytosis is involved in the activation of Cl secretion via CFTR in the human airway serous cell line, Calu-3.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Serous cells are located primarily in the submucosal glands of human airway and are known to express CFTR.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	18	The overall question of how much of the function of CFTR is dependent on its insertion into the plasma membrane can be answered by the phrase "it depends.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	19	" CFTR is expressed in a variety of tissues, including airway, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, where it participates in ion transport (5).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus how much of CFTR-mediated transport is controlled by exocytosis may depend critically on which organ is being considered.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Moreover, when cultured cells are being studied, it may also depend on the degree of differentiation of the cells.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	22	For example, in the current article in focus (Ref.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	23	 C913 in this issue), Loffing and colleagues demonstrate that exocytosis of CFTR-containing vesicles is not involved in the activation of Cl secretion in Calu-3 cells.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Similarly, exocytic delivery of CFTR does not occur in gallbladder epithelium (14).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Presumably in these tissues, activation of resident CFTR is sufficient to regulate transport.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In other tissues such as the shark rectal gland, bronchial epithelial cells, and in transporting cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II and A6, cAMP increases the amount of CFTR in the apical cell membrane (7, 9, 11, 13).
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In T84 cells (a colonic epithelial cell line), the results are conflicting, suggesting either that culture conditions may affect the machinery for cAMP-dependent exocytosis of CFTR (12, 15) or that methodological difficulties in localizing CFTR in the plasma membrane make it difficult to detect exocytosis of CFTR.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Thus the question of how much of a role exocytosis plays in regulating the transport of CFTR in T84 cells is still unresolved.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	29	Loffing and colleagues (10) speculate that serous cells in the airway have high basal rates of Cl and antibiotic secretion.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This may require that high levels of CFTR be present at all times to support such a high level of transport.
0.4255241.9755043.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Given that CFTR is highly regulated both by phosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis, then why do some tissues need to control its function further by rapidly moving CFTR to the plasma membrane via exocytosis? One may speculate that stimulation of transport via CFTR, by increasing the number of channels though exocytosis, may occur only in tissues such as the shark rectal gland, where very large and rapid changes in transport occur.

0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	3	THE ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) serves as a way station during the biogenesis of nearly every integral membrane and secreted protein synthesized in eukaryotic cells.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	4	 As such, its primary role is to facilitate the folding of nascent polypeptides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Thus plentiful among the ER resident proteins are 1) enzymes that catalyze conformational rearrangements, such as protein disulfide isomerase and peptidylprolyl isomerase; 2) enzymes that chemically modify the nascent polypeptide, such as signal sequence peptidase and oligosaccharyl transferase; and 3) molecules that retain the polypeptide in a soluble, aggregation-free state.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The factors constituting this last group are molecular chaperones, many of which were first identified as heat shock proteins (HSPs) because their synthesis is induced when cells are exposed to high temperatures or other stresses.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, most HSPs have cellular homologs that are constitutively produced, and these are named heat shock cognate proteins (HSCs).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HSC and HSP molecular chaperones are defined by their molecular masses (in kDa), and a plentiful class found in every cell type are those with a molecular mass of ~70 kDa (i.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	9	HSP70 and HSC70 hydrolyze ATP concomitant with their binding to and release from polypeptide substrates, and their ATPase activities may be activated by another group of chaperones (21, 33) known as HSP40 or DnaJ homologs.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In some cases, the HSP40 cochaperone delivers a polypeptide substrate to the HSP70 or HSC70 (17, 37).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	11	 With the use of a variety of in vitro techniques, the HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones have been shown to bind preferentially to short stretches of amino acids with overall hydrophobic character (3, 13, 31).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Such motifs are normally buried within the core of a native protein but may become solvent accessible during protein folding and upon protein denaturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus HSC70 and HSP70 chaperones are ideally suited to aid unfolded proteins en route to their native conformations by limiting protein aggregation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	14	Deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the most common mutation associated with CF (27).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CFTR most likely functions as a chloride channel in the plasma membrane of airway and other epithelial cells, but cells containing only the F508 variant either lack or harbor variable amounts of the protein at the plasma membrane (7, 16).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Both wild-type and the F508 mutant form of CFTR are translocated into the ER membrane, at which time protein folding should commence.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, in vitro studies by Qu and colleagues (25, 26) suggest that the efficiency of F508 CFTR folding is severely impaired compared with that of the wild-type protein.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It has also been shown that the F508 mutant protein is unable to undergo an ATP-dependent conformational change in the ER (20, 40).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Consistent with an inability of F508 CFTR to fold efficiently, incubation of cells expressing the mutant at lower temperatures, a condition that may favor protein folding and/or stability, permits some of this variant to traffic to the plasma membrane where it is active (10), albeit with a reduced open probability and half-life (9, 11, 19).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In contrast, if CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a substrate for ER-associated degradation, a quality control mechanism that degrades aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway (4).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Degradation of CFTR, like most other ER-associated degradation substrates, requires ubiquitinylation and delivery to the multicatalytic cytoplasmic proteasome (14, 36, 38).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although a significant proportion of even wild-type CFTR is degraded, nearly all of the F508 mutant is destroyed; therefore, cells expressing only the mutant form of the protein are phenotypically null.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	23	Because F508 CFTR is unable to attain a native conformation in the ER, it should not come as a surprise that it interacts with molecular chaperones.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Specifically, cytoplasmic HSC70 and HSP90, the luminal Ca2+-binding chaperone calnexin, and a cytoplasmic HSP40 homolog Hdj2 can be coprecipitated with CFTR (18, 22, 24, 39).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	25	 HSC70 and Hdj2 also prevent the in vitro aggregation of the first nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR (22, 34), the domain in which the phenylalanine at position 508 resides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Although wild-type, folded CFTR is released from the chaperones on its transit from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, HSC70 and calnexin remain bound to the mutant until degradation ensues (24, 39).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A HSC70-interacting factor, CHIP, has recently been shown to facilitate the degradation of immature forms of CFTR (23).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	28	 One interpretation of these combined data is that the chaperone-CFTR complexes represent folding intermediates.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	29	Because several human diseases arise from defects in protein folding (4, 35), because of the devastating effects and widespread occurrence of CF, and because a profound amount of information is available on the mechanisms of molecular chaperones, the modulation of protein folding and chaperone activity has been attempted with small molecules and genetic manipulations.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, it was demonstrated by the Welch (5) and Kopito (32) laboratories that F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in glycerol, a polyol known to stabilize proteins in vitro, contain ER-matured forms of CFTR and display cAMP (forskolin)-activated plasma membrane chloride transport, a hallmark of functional CFTR.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Glycerol also facilitates the in vitro folding of the first nucleotide-binding domain lacking the phenylalanine at position 508 by preventing off-pathway intermediates from forming (25).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	32	 F508 CFTR-expressing cells incubated in trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), an osmotic stabilizer found in sharks to protect proteins from urea denaturation, exhibit similar properties (5).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Compounds such as TMAO and glycerol are now commonly known as chemical chaperones.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	34	Another means to alter protein folding in vivo is through the modulation of intracellular chaperone concentration.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	35	 (28) showed that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), an ammonia scavenger approved for the treatment of urea cycle disorders and a known transcriptional regulator, permits a fraction of F508 CFTR to mature in bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary nasal epithelial cells from patients with CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Maturation of the mutant coincides with cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl conductance in the treated cells.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	37	 To determine the molecular basis of 4PBA-mediated rescue of the F508 CFTR phenotype, immunoprecipitations were performed to examine the amount of CFTR associated with HSC70, and a 4PBA dose-dependent decrease in the amount of CFTR-HSC70 complex was observed (30).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because HSC70 was shown to facilitate ubiquitination of several test proteins in vitro (2), the authors suggested that HSC70 targets CFTR for degradation and that 4PBA, through an unknown mechanism, reduces the amount of the complex by which CFTR is delivered to the proteasome.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	39	The studies described above support the concept of using chaperone modulation as a means to rectify the pathophysiology associated with F508 CFTR.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Now, three papers in this issue of the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology (8, 12, 29) represent a significant leap in our understanding of the molecular basis of chaperone modulation, with the ultimate hope that such interventions may become clinically relevant for CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	41	Building on previous studies, Rubenstein and Lyons (29) show that the mechanism by which 4PBA downregulates HSC70 levels is through a decrease in the stability of HSC70 mRNA.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Although HSC70 mRNA is known to be relatively unstable, 4PBA appears to further accelerate its degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Coincident with an acceleration of mRNA degradation, an ~40% reduction in the amount of HSC70 is evident.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but it has been shown that inhibiting the initiation of yeast HSC70 translation leads to a rapid destruction of its message (1).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Because a large number of translation poisons are known, many of which were first isolated as antibiotics, this hypothesis can be tested.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	46	Does 4PBA only modulate HSC70 levels? Although previous data (30) suggested that this was so, new work from Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (8) indicates that 4PBA raises HSP70 levels, leading to increased HSP70-F508 CFTR complex formation and F508 CFTR maturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	47	 One concern is that this phenomenon may arise from a secondary effect of decreasing HSC70 levels (see above), which, in turn, could induce a general heat shock or stress response.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	48	 However, the authors show that CFTR maturation is also facilitated by selectively increasing the intracellular levels of HSP70 by transient transfection with an HSP70 expression vector.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	49	These combined studies suggest that modulating the levels and thus the activities of HSC70 and HSP70 enhances CFTR maturation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	50	 They also point to the complexity of HSP70 or HSC70 function in the cell.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	51	, HSP70) facilitates protein folding, its homolog (i.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	52	, HSC70) targets a misfolded protein for degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Previous data suggest that multiple chaperones bind coordinately to nascent polypeptides.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Although the functions of many of these chaperones are likely to be redundant, it seems logical that a subset is required for folding and another subset is necessary for protein degradation.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	55	 If one group fails to fold the polypeptide, another is readily available to target the substrate for destruction.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The activities of the unique sets of chaperones may be further defined by the action of the HSP40/DnaJ cochaperones that regulate HSP70 and HSC70 function.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In other cases, the folding and degradation targeting activities may reside in one chaperone complex.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	58	 For example, HSP90 has been proposed to facilitate both CFTR maturation and degradation (18).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	59	Another means to catalyze CFTR folding is through the use of chemical chaperones, an attack that has shown promise in in vitro model systems as described above.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	60	 To determine whether this approach is feasible in an animal system, Fischer et al.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	61	 (12) examined whether TMAO corrects the F508 CFTR trafficking defect in mice.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Because the severity of the defect associated with the F508 form of CFTR is most prevalent in the rodent intestine, measurements of rectal potential difference (RPD) were undertaken in control mice, those lacking CFTR, and F508 CFTR mice.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Administration of TMAO over 24 h by subcutaneous injection reveals significant increases in forskolin-activated RPD hyperpolarization in the control and F508 CFTR mice, consistent with a partial rescue of the folding defects associated with the wild-type and mutant proteins.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Most promising from a clinical perspective is the observation that administering the flavinoid apigenin, a CFTR activator, further increases the forskolin-activated RPD in the F508 CFTR-expressing mouse.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This result supports the promise that combined therapeutic attacks may present the best option to lessen the pathophysiology of CF.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Combining small-molecule activators of CFTR function is warranted, particularly in this case, because the concentrations of TMAO used for these studies are quite high and the physiological effects of prolonged administration of TMAO are unknown.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	67	Might chaperone-based therapies become clinically relevant and generalized to the spectrum of diseases that arise from protein misfolding? The corrective effects of glycerol and 4-PBA on the maturation and secretion of another "conformational disease"-causing protein, the Z variant of antitrypsin, have been recently reported by Burrows et al.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In addition, other chaperone modulators are currently being examined for their ability to correct misfolded proteins.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	69	 15-Deoxyspergualin, a known HSC70 effector and immunosuppressant, increases the cAMP-stimulated plasma membrane Cl channel activity of F508 CFTR-expressing cells (15).
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	70	 However, because an increase in ER-matured forms of F508 CFTR could not be observed with 15-deoxyspergualin treatment, only a small amount of the mutant had likely trafficked to the plasma membrane and yielded the desired activity.
0.41579112.11404243.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Nevertheless, with the advent of combinatorial chemistry and more defined methods to examine protein folding and chaperone action at the molecular level, I suspect that we will see a new convergence of chemical, cell biological, and biophysical tools geared to combat a variety of human diseases.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	10	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is caused by mutations in a single gene: the one that encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	11	 CFTR, which is a member of the "ATP-binding cassette" (ABC) family of membrane transport proteins, forms a phosphorylation- and ATP-dependent Cl channel (3, 4).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It remains unclear how the reduced epithelial Cl permeability caused by the functional absence of CFTR leads to the complexity of symptoms seen in CF lung disease.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This, coupled with the structural similarity between CFTR and other ABC proteins, has long hinted that CFTR may also perform some other function.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	14	The anionic tripeptide glutathione (-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) is the most important extracellular antioxidant in the lung (1, 20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Airway surface fluid (ASF) contains ~400  microM GSH, ~50 times the concentration found in plasma and 100 times that found in the extracellular fluid of many other tissues (1, 5, 17, 20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The source of the high concentration of GSH found in ASF is unknown (20).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Interestingly, the concentration of GSH in ASF is greatly reduced in CF (16), which may exacerbate the severe oxidative stress that results from chronic inflammation of the CF lung (19).

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	19	Recently we demonstrated that a broad range of large organic anions were able to permeate through the CFTR Cl channel from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and we suggested that release of such anions into ASF might be a novel physiological function of CFTR (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Here we show that both GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) can permeate through CFTR from the intracellular solution.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These results suggest that CFTR, in addition to its role as a Cl channel, may function as a permeation pathway by which GSH is released into ASF.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Such a function would suggest a previously unidentified link between CFTR and lung antioxidant defense.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The current reversal potential, Erev, was estimated by fitting a polynomial function to the I-V relationship and was used to estimate permeability (P) ratios according to the equations (1) (2) where F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	37	Block of CFTR Cl current by GSH and GSSG was analyzed using the Woodhull model of voltage-dependent block (21) (3) where i is the amplitude of the current remaining in the presence of blocker, i0 is the control, unblocked current amplitude, [B] is the blocker concentration, V is the membrane potential, and Kd(V) is the voltage-dependent dissociation constant, the voltage dependence of which is given by (4) where z' is the apparent valence of the blocking ion.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Permeability ratios shown for GSH and GSSG in extracellular solution in absence of pyrophosphate (PPi) are maximum values, since no reversal potential was observed under these conditions over voltage range studied.

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	61	The suggestion that intracellular large organic anions were permeant in CFTR and not simply transported by some CFTR-regulated transport process was supported by the finding that currents carried by such large anions were inhibited by the CFTR open-channel blockers DNDS and glibenclamide (11).

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Indeed, the large organic anions gluconate and glutamate, both of which are permeant in CFTR when present in the intracellular solution (11), are also low-affinity blockers of Cl permeation through the channel (10).

0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	79	Despite early skepticism due to its structure, CFTR has been conclusively proven to be a Cl channel.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Reduced transepithelial Cl transport is thought to be the primary defect in CF (15); however, the link between this reduced Cl permeability and the pathogenesis of CF lung disease remains unclear.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Previously, we suggested that CFTR may fulfill another direct transport role, allowing efflux of a broad range of large organic anions from the cytoplasm (11).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Based on our present results, we propose that a potential physiological substrate for this transport pathway is the important antioxidant molecule GSH.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The ability of GSH to permeate through CFTR suggests a direct link between CFTR and antioxidant defense in the lung.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	84	GSH is synthesized in the cytoplasm, where levels of 1-10 mM are typical (17).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	85	 High concentrations of GSH (~400  microM) are also found in ASF of healthy individuals (1).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	86	 We propose that GSH may be released into ASF via CFTR, further emphasizing the role of CFTR in determining ASF composition (18).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Because cytoplasmic concentrations of GSH are so high, a passive permeation pathway would presumably be sufficient to mediate release of such amounts of GSH into ASF.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Loss of this GSH transport pathway may contribute to CF lung disease.
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The levels of GSH are greatly reduced in ASF of CF patients (16), potentially exacerbating the oxidant stress that results from neutrophil-dominated inflammation of the CF lung (16, 19).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	90	 GSH levels in ASF are also reduced in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and adult respiratory distress syndrome and are increased in cigarette smokers with no clinical evidence of lung disease (16).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	91	GSH and GSSG transport by CFTR suggests a functional similarity between CFTR and the structurally related ABC proteins, multidrug resistance protein (MRP) and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT; also known as MRP2).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Both MRP and cMOAT mediate ATP-dependent export of large intracellular organic anions, in particular glutathione-S-conjugates (6, 14).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	93	 GSSG is a substrate for both MRP- and cMOAT-mediated transport (8, 14).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Unconjugated GSH may be transported by cMOAT (14) but is thought not to be transported by MRP (8); however it may act as a cosubstrate for MRP-mediated transport of unconjugated compounds (12, 13).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Potential functional overlap between CFTR and other ABC proteins is of particular interest, since it has been suggested that MRP may be able to functionally substitute for CFTR in the lung and alleviate CF symptoms (7).
0.46872106.9688865.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Our results suggest that such functional substitution may be due to restoration of GSH or GSH-conjugate transport.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated chloride channel expressed at the apical surface of epithelia.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although the regulation of CFTR by protein kinases is well documented, channel deactivation by phosphatases is not well understood.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We find that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A can physically associate with the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	7	 PP2A is a heterotrimeric phosphatase composed of a catalytic subunit and two divergent regulatory subunits (A and B).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The cellular localization and substrate specificity of PP2A is determined by the unique combination of A and B regulatory subunits, which can give rise to at least 75 different enzymes.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	9	 By mass spectrometry, we identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR as A and B' and find that the B' subunit binds CFTR directly.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	10	 PP2A subunits localize to the apical surface of airway epithelia and PP2A phosphatase activity co-purifies with CFTR in Calu-3 cells.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In functional assays, inhibitors of PP2A block rundown of basal CFTR currents and increase channel activity in excised patches of airway epithelia and in intact mouse jejunum.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, PP2A inhibition in well differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells results in a CFTR-dependent increase in the airway surface liquid.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cystic fibrosis (CF)2 is an autosomal lethal disease characterized by abnormal ion transport in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an apical membrane chloride channel.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The regulation of CFTR by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other protein kinases has been extensively documented.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	19	 PKA can phosphorylate the CFTR regulatory domain (R domain) on at least 11 serine residues (1-3).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In vivo, PKA phosphorylation increases CFTR open probability and the number of channels in the plasma membrane (4, 5).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that PKA and other regulatory proteins are compartmentalized in close proximity to CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The cellular machinery capable of generating cAMP, including the adenosine receptor and membrane-bound adenylate cyclase are present with CFTR in apical membrane patches (6).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) target PKA to protein complexes with CFTR (7-9), and the disruption of the PKA/AKAP interaction abolishes the ability of PKA to activate CFTR in response to physiologic stimuli (9).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, the phosphodiesterase PDE4D is also present with CFTR in patch preparations and forms a cAMP diffusion barrier at the apical plasma membrane (10).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Other CFTR regulatory molecules including protein kinase C and the AMP-activated protein kinase are found in protein complexes associated directly with CFTR (11, 12).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	26	Less is known about the ability of serine/threonine phosphatases to regulate CFTR activity or how they are compartmentalized with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Work from many laboratories suggests that multiple phosphatases, including PP2A, PP2B, PP2C, and alkaline phosphatase, are involved in the deactivation of CFTR (13-17).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In vitro, PP2A and PP2C are most effective in dephosphorylating purified CFTR and recombinant R domain.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, exogenous PP2A and PP2C inactivate CFTR in excised membrane patches (13, 18).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In human sweat ducts, cardiac myocytes, 3T3 fibroblasts, and Hi-5 insect cells, inhibitors of PP2A increase CFTR channel activity (14, 16, 18, 19).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Likewise, PP2B inhibitors stimulate CFTR in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (17).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, the contribution of PP2A and PP2B to CFTR deactivation may vary in different cell types (15, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In baby hamster kidney cells, PP2C co-immunoprecipitates with exogenously expressed CFTR (20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Additionally, PP2C overexpression in Fischer rat thyroid cells decreases CFTR chloride conductance (15).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, the ability of endogenous PP2C to regulate CFTR in native epithelial tissues is unclear, since no PP2C inhibitors have been identified.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	36	 To date, no single phosphatase has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient to completely down-regulate CFTR channel activity, suggesting that CFTR is dephosphorylated by multiple phosphatases.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Here, we present evidence for a direct interaction between CFTR and the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This interaction involves the COOH terminus of CFTR and the PP2A B' regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	39	 PP2A localizes to the apical cell surface, where it negatively regulates CFTR channel activity in Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A increases the airway surface liquid in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells by a mechanism requiring CFTR channel activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We conclude that PP2A is indeed a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Therefore, we asked whether the PP2A B' subunit could interact directly with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	144	 We find that PP2A B' subunit expressed and purified from reticulocyte lysates binds to CFTR-(1451-1476) but not other CFTR C-terminal peptides (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	145	 NHERF-1, previously shown to interact with the extreme COOH terminus of CFTR, is enriched by the CFTR-(1471-1480) peptide, demonstrating the specificity of this assay (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Although we do not find the catalytic or A subunit associated with the purified B' subunit from reticulocyte lysates (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that these subunits are present at low levels and may be influencing binding to CFTR-(1451-1476).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Using bacterially expressed, purified B' subunit, we observe direct and dose-dependent binding to CFTR-(1451-1476) (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Furthermore, we also find that the core PP2A dimer, composed of the catalytic and A regulatory subunit, do not bind to CFTR-(1451-1476) unless the B' subunit is present (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Whereas it is not clear whether the B' subunit alone is necessary and sufficient for targeting PP2A to CFTR, these data suggest that the B' subunit may play a critical role in the binding specificity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	150	PP2A Localizes to the Apical Cell Surface of Airway Epithelia If PP2A is a physiologically relevant CFTR phosphatase, we reasoned that its subcellular localization should partially overlap with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Given the large number of PP2A substrates, we expect the ubiquitously expressed catalytic and tightly coupled A regulatory subunits to have a broad cellular distribution.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, specific B regulatory subunits, which target the PP2A enzyme to distinct subcellular compartments, should have a more restricted localization.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Using a pan-B' antibody, which recognizes all five gene products (, , , , and ), we examined the localization of PP2A in the human airway.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Although we cannot unambiguously attribute the apical localization to the B' subunit, it is likely that this staining reflects the distribution of one or a combination of the cytosolic B' subunits, B', B', B', and B' (35).

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In excised membrane patches, endogenous PKA activity activates CFTR when exogenous cAMP is added in excess or when membrane-associated adenylate cyclase is activated by receptors (6, 9).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	182	 In patch preparations, CFTR channel activity reflects the phosphorylation status of the channel, which is regulated by a balance between PKA and endogenous phosphatases (6, 18, 37).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Consequently, CFTR channel gating is increased under conditions in which PKA activity is elevated, such as increased cAMP or the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (1, 10).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We hypothesize that "rundown" of CFTR activity following excision results from a shift in the balance between endogenous PKA and phosphatase activities.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Based on our biochemical analyses demonstrating a physical association between CFTR and PP2A, we tested this hypothesis by examining CFTR rundown in excised patches under control conditions and in the presence of PP2A inhibitors.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	186	 We compared the average pipette current during the first 30 s of outside out recordings with the average pipette current measured from 270 to 300 s, as performed in previous studies (38).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Under control conditions, the pipette solution contained ATP and GTP, conditions that allow CFTR gating to reflect the activity of endogenous PKA (6).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Furthermore, current flow through the patch is mediated by Cl- traversing CFTR, since no channel events are observed, and pipette current is near zero with protein kinase A inhibitor (100 nM) in the pipette (0.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Furthermore, the inhibitor data demonstrate that endogenous PP2A can regulate CFTR channel activity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These results strongly suggest that PP2A functions as a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We also tested whether PP2A inhibitors altered basal CFTR activity in an intact epithelium.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	223	 We measured basal short circuit chloride currents in freshly excised sections of mouse jejunum in Ussing chamber experiments.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR constitutes the major chloride channel in these preparations, since jejunum from CFTR-/- mice do not exhibit significant chloride conductance (43).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	225	 We find that over the course of control experiments, basal CFTR activity declined over time (Isc =-9.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In agreement with our patch clamp data, we find that the PP2A inhibitor endothall (100  microM) prevented rundown of CFTR activity, resulting in increased chloride conductance during the course of the 90-min recording (Isc = 12.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In CF lung disease, PCL volume is depleted, reflecting an imbalance in solute transport across the epithelium (44-47).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Ultimately, PCL depletion results in defective mucociliary clearance, which supports bacterial colonization and exposes individuals to life-threatening infections (27, 44-48).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Previous studies have demonstrated that CFTR mediates the majority of PCL secretion and plays a fundamental role in maintaining basal PCL volume (36, 49).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of PP2A would increase CFTR activity and thereby increase PCL levels in primary HBE cultures.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The PCL was labeled with florescent dextran as previously described (27).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	233	 PCL height was measured immediately before and 10 min after the indicated treatments.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Because PP2A inhibition is likely to influence the activities of many cellular proteins, we asked whether CFTR was required for the increase in PCL.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Consistent with previous data demonstrating the importance of CFTR in PCL secretion, we find that the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, causes PCL height to decrease by 30% (PCL =-3.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Furthermore, in the presence of CFTRinh172, okadaic acid was similar to the CFTRinh172 alone (PCL =-2.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Thus, the inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid increases PCL height by a mechanism that requires CFTR.

0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Previously, we demonstrated that CFTR is localized in close proximity with regulatory proteins in vivo, including the adenosine receptor, adenylate cyclases, PKA, and phosphodiesterases (6, 9, 10).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In addition, many signaling proteins that regulate CFTR activity, including PKA (7-9), protein kinase C (11), PP2C (20), and AMP kinase (12), have been shown to be organized in multi-protein complexes directly associated with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The data in the present study add to this model by demonstrating that the phosphatase PP2A is both physically and functionally linked to CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	245	The regulation of CFTR by phosphatases has been extensively studied.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Whereas it is clear from the work of many laboratories that multiple phosphatases can affect CFTR channel activity, the specificity of this regulation is poorly understood.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We identified PP2A in a biochemical screen for proteins that associate with residues 1451-1476 of the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The power of our approach is illustrated by the fact that we unambiguously identified the exact PP2A regulatory subunits associated with CFTR by mass spectrometry as A and B'.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	249	 To date, at least 21 distinct PP2A regulatory subunits have been identified (2 A regulatory and 19 B regulatory subunits) (for a review, see Ref.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Importantly, it is the unique combination of regulatory subunits that governs the enzymatic activity, substrate specificity, and localization of PP2A enzymes (35, 51).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Thus, the identification of the exact subunits associated with CFTR provides insight into the specificity of CFTR channel regulation by phosphatases.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	252	Using purified proteins, we find that the divergent B' subunit interacts directly with CFTR-(1451-1476) and is required for the binding of the catalytic and A regulatory subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These data suggest that the B' subunit may target the PP2A enzyme to CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	254	 It is intriguing to speculate that the expression of the B' subunit may account for the differences in the ability of PP2A to regulate CFTR channel activity in different cell types and tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Many of the CFTR phosphatase studies have utilized heterologous expression systems such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (13), baby hamster kidney cells (20), and Hi-5 insect cells (19), which may or may not express relevant CFTR phosphatases and subunits (13, 19, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We are unable to ask whether the PP2A B' subunit is expressed in these cell types by reverse transcription-PCR, since there is insufficient sequence information available at this time.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	257	 However, the expression of specific PP2A subunits in these cells should be an important consideration for future experiments.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	258	 (33) reported an interaction between CFTR and PP2A, which involves the direct binding of the ubiquitously expressed PP2A A regulatory subunit to the CFTR regulatory domain.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	259	 To demonstrate the specificity of the CFTR/A interaction, Vastiau et al.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	260	 (33) showed that the overexpressed heat repeats 1-10 cause a decrease in CFTR rundown, presumably due to the disruption of the A/CFTR interaction.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	261	 However, the PP2A B subunits also bind to heat repeats 1-10 of the A subunit and would have been dislodged from the phosphatase complex (52, 53).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Thus, in these assays, the observed decrease in CFTR rundown could be attributed to the disruption of the interaction between CFTR and both the PP2A A and B regulatory subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Nonetheless, the anchoring of PP2A to the CFTR chloride channel may involve multiple sites of interaction mediated by the PP2A A and B' subunits.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	264	Previous studies have demonstrated a clear role for PP2A in the deactivation or rundown of CFTR in native sweat ducts, cardiac myocytes, baby hamster kidney cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, and Hi-5 cells (14, 16, 18, 19).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	265	 However, the importance of PP2A in CFTR regulation in epithelial tissues seems variable.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Thus, we chose to study the physical and functional association of CFTR and PP2A in airway epithelia.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Indeed, we found that CFTR and PP2A interacted in Calu-3 cells as the PP2A catalytic, A regulatory, and B' regulatory subunits specifically co-precipitate with endogenous CFTR (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Additionally, we examined the localization of PP2A subunits in the human airway.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	269	 If, in fact, PP2A regulates CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues, we would expect the phosphatase to be present at the apical cell surface, consistent with the localization of CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The ubiquitously expressed PP2A catalytic subunit and A regulatory subunit had a diffuse staining pattern, which clearly included the apical membrane of the superficial epithelium (data not shown).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Alternatively, staining with a pan-B' regulatory subunit antibody showed a more restricted distribution, including strong staining at the apical plasma membrane (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Thus, the PP2A subunits associated with CFTR are present at the apical cell surface where CFTR functions.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Since the available B' antibodies detect all family members, we cannot rule out the possibility that other B' subunits other than B' may also associate with CFTR or localize to the apical surface of airway epithelia.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	274	 (54) identified an interaction between Chk2 and the PP2A B' subunit and found that the other highly similar B' family members, B', B', B', and B', were also able to bind to Chk2 in vitro.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Consequently, other PP2A B' regulatory subunits may interact with CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	276	 However, we did not find an association between CFTR and a structurally unrelated B regulatory family member, B (PR55a) by pull-down (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	277	 2A) or immunoprecipitation (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Thus, the PP2A molecules associated with CFTR at least appear to be specific for the B' family.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	279	We found that CFTR and PP2A are functionally associated in airway and intestinal epithelial cells.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In the presence of PP2A inhibitors, CFTR rundown was blocked in outside-out membrane patches from Calu-3 cells and intact mouse jejunum (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Consistent with our biochemical observations, the presence of PP2A in the membrane patches containing CFTR strongly suggests that these proteins are closely compartmentalized.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Furthermore, our data suggest that PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in epithelial tissues, in agreement with Vastiau et al.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	283	 (33), who found that the addition of okadaic acid in Caco-2 epithelial cells delayed channel rundown following forskolin treatment.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In T84 and airway epithelial cells, PP2A inhibitors did not block the rundown of CFTR following maximal activation by forskolin (15, 20).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	285	 A major difference between our data and data of other studies is that we chose to measure the effect of PP2A inhibitors on basal CFTR currents as opposed to CFTR currents following maximal activation with forskolin or PKA.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	286	 It is possible that endogenous PP2A plays a role in regulating basal CFTR currents but that other phosphatases contribute to the deactivation of hyperphosphorylated CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Future studies are needed to address the relative contribution of different phosphatases to the regulation of CFTR channel activity in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	288	In the airways, the mucus layer provides a defensive barrier that traps and clears bacteria and noxious particles from the airways (44-47).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The underlying PCL provides a low viscosity fluid that facilitates ciliary beating and mucus clearance (12, 55, 56).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Based on inhibitor studies, CFTR has been demonstrated to play a central role in the maintenance of basal PCL height (36, 49).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Furthermore, the loss of CFTR function results in decreased PCL height and increased viscosity.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	292	 If, in fact, PP2A is a relevant CFTR phosphatase in airway epithelia, we reasoned that the inhibition of PP2A should increase CFTR chloride conductance and ultimately increase PCL height in primary HBE cultures.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	293	 We find that the inhibition of PP2A by the addition of okadaic acid to primary HBE cultures produces a 30% increase in PCL height, consistent with an increase in CFTR activity (Fig.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Additionally, when CFTR channel activity is blocked by CFTRinh172, okadaic acid does not have a significant effect of the PCL.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Thus, okadaic acid treatment increases PCL height through a CFTR-dependent mechanism, consistent with our hypothesis that CFTR is compartmentalized with and regulated by PP2A in epithelial tissues.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	296	In addition to regulating channel activity by dephosphorylating CFTR, PP2A may also be important for mediating other signaling and trafficking events for CFTR.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	297	 For example, AMP-activated protein kinase, which directly binds to CFTR and negatively regulates channel activity, can also directly interact with PP2A via the A regulatory subunit (12, 56).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Moreover, the direct interaction between CFTR and AMP-activated protein kinase has been mapped to CFTR residues 1420-1457, adjacent to the residues where we observe PP2A binding (residues 1451-1476) (12).
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	299	 It is interesting to speculate that PP2A and AMP-activated protein kinase may function to stabilize each other's interactions with CFTR or may compete for binding to the CFTR COOH terminus.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	300	In summary, we establish that CFTR is physically and functionally associated with PP2A.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Our data demonstrate that PP2A directly interacts with CFTR via the B' regulatory subunit.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that PP2A regulates CFTR in airway epithelia, the major tissue affected in CF.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Finally, we demonstrate that the inhibition of PP2A in well differentiated HBE cultures increases PCL height.
0.41414222.16239222.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Because decreased PCL underlies the basic defect in airway clearance observed in CF patients, our data suggest that PP2A may be a useful therapeutic target for CF.

0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	4	To delineate the mechanisms that facilitate leukocyte migration into the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, expression of chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and RANTES, was compared between CF and non-CF airway epithelia.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The findings presented herein demonstrate that, under either basal conditions or tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)- and/or interferon- (IFN-)-stimulated conditions, a consistent pattern of differences in the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 between CF and non-CF epithelial cells was not observed.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In contrast, CF epithelial cells expressed no detectable RANTES protein or mRNA under basal conditions or when stimulated with TNF- and/or IFN- (P  0.

0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Transfection studies utilizing RANTES promoter constructs suggested that CFTR activates the RANTES promoter via a nuclear factor-B-mediated pathway.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Together, these results suggest that 1) RANTES expression is altered in CF epithelia and 2) epithelial expression of RANTES, but not IL-8 or MCP-1, is dependent on CFTR.

0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The CFTR gene encodes a 180-kDa glycosylated protein that functions as a low-conductance, cAMP-regulated chloride channel (23).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Progressive pulmonary tissue damage is a hallmark of CF; however, pancreatic, liver, and intestinal dysfunction are also characteristic of CF.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The CF lung disease phenotype includes thick mucus secretion and bacterial colonization of the airway with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Recent reports suggest that the CF lung may exhibit an exaggerated immune response (19) even in the absence of bacterial infection (1, 12).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	19	CF-associated airway inflammation is characterized by a profound influx of neutrophils into the lung; however, other types of leukocytes, including eosinophils and monocytes, have been implicated in CF airway inflammation.

0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The data presented herein demonstrate that CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells, in the presence or absence of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IFN-, expressed levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 that were not consistent; therefore, these data suggest that no differences exist in the expression of these molecules between CF and non-CF cells.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	272	 In sharp contrast, however, CF epithelial cells expressed little or no RANTES protein or mRNA compared with non-CF controls.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Although CF and non-CF epithelial cells derived from the pancreas, another CF-affected organ, exhibited a pattern of IL-8 and MCP-1 expression that differed from their respective airway epithelial counterparts, the pattern of RANTES expression was the same: CF pancreatic epithelial cells expressed no detectable RANTES protein or mRNA compared with non-CF controls.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Importantly, insertion of WT-CFTR into CF airway and pancreatic epithelial cells to correct the CFTR defect restored RANTES protein and mRNA expression in the presence of TNF- and IFN- via an NF-B-mediated pathway; however, correction of the CFTR defect had no effect on IL-8 or MCP-1 expression in these cells.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Together, these results demonstrate that 1) cytokine-induced RANTES expression is altered in CF epithelia and 2) epithelial gene expression of RANTES, but not IL-8 or MCP-1, is dependent on CFTR.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	276	The studies presented herein were performed in the presence and absence of TNF- and/or IFN-, but not P.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	277	 (26) detected elevated levels of TNF- in the sputum of CF patients who were not infected with P.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Their study concluded that high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-, may contribute to the localized neutrophil-dominated inflammatory state observed in the CF airway (26).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Second, increasing evidence suggests that an exaggerated inflammatory response may exist in the CF lung in the presence or absence of bacterial infection.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	280	 (12) demonstrated that airway inflammation may occur before the appearance of bacterial pathogens in CF patients.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These investigators examined BALF from control and CF infants; their results demonstrated a significant increase in the number of neutrophils and in IL-8 levels in the BALF of CF infants who had negative cultures for common bacterial CF-related pathogens, including P.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	282	 aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, compared with normal controls.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	283	 In contrast, Armstrong and co-workers (1) reported that the early onset of airway inflammation in CF infants is due to the presence of respiratory pathogens not previously diagnosed.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Their studies demonstrated that increased neutrophil numbers and IL-8 levels in the BALF of CF infants correlate with bacteria and/or viral infection.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	285	 However, these authors also showed that uninfected CF infants have a greater number of BALF neutrophils than normal controls, suggesting that an enhanced airway inflammatory response occurs in CF patients (1).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	286	 (19) reported that IL-8 levels were markedly elevated in the BALF of infected CF patients compared with levels in infected and uninfected controls, even after standardization of IL-8 concentrations to bacterial counts.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	287	Although the studies presented herein indicate that CF and non-CF airway epithelial cell lines express inconsistent differences in the levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 in the presence and absence of TNF- and IFN-, the mere expression of these chemokines implicates CF epithelia in the leukocyte migration observed in CF-associated airway inflammation.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Moreover, the observation that CF and non-CF airway epithelial cells expressed comparable levels of IL-8, in the presence or absence of proinflammatory cytokines, together with the observation that complementation of CF epithelial cells did not alter IL-8 expression by these cells, suggests 1) that enhanced IL-8 expression by CF airway epithelial cells is not the source of the increased IL-8 levels detected in uninfected CF patient BALF and 2) that cytokine-induced epithelial IL-8 expression is regulated independently of CFTR.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These findings contradict previous studies that reported increased IL-8 expression by CF airway epithelial cells in the presence and absence of proinflammatory stimuli (24, 30).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Ruef and co-workers (24) demonstrated that the CF airway epithelial cell line JME/CF15 secreted IL-8 in the absence of stimuli; this expression was enhanced further in the presence of IL-1.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	291	 From these analyses of a single CF epithelial cell line, the authors concluded that local production of IL-8 by CF epithelial cells may trigger significant upregulation of airway inflammation in CF (24).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	292	 (30) reported recently that the CF airway epithelial cell lines IB3-1 and 2CF expressed significantly more IL-8 protein than the non-CF epithelial cell lines BEAS2B or normal human primary bronchial epithelial cells in the presence of TNF- or IL-1; the WT-CFTR-complemented IB3-1 cell line C38 expressed IL-8 levels that were similar to that expressed by non-CF cells.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	293	 However, these authors examined only two CF epithelial cell lines, did not compare IL-8 expression between CF and non-CF primary airway epithelial cells, and, importantly, did not demonstrate that the complemented cell line C38 exhibited WT-CFTR activity (30).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	294	The inability of CF epithelial cells to express RANTES protein or mRNA suggests that these cells do not recruit eosinophils into the CF lung via this particular C-C chemokine.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Airway epithelial cells have been shown to express C-C chemokines other than RANTES, including eotaxin (20) and MCP-4 (32), that may facilitate eosinophil migration.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	296	 To this end, we have been unable to detect eotaxin expression in CF and non-CF primary airway epithelial cells; however, we have observed that the non-CF pancreatic epithelial cell line PANC-1 expresses eotaxin in response to TNF- alone or together with IFN-, whereas its CF counterpart CFPAC-1 does not (L.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Schwiebert, unpublished observations).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In a recent report by Stellato et al.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	299	 (32), the authors demonstrated that the CF airway epithelial cell line IB3-1 expressed MCP-1 mRNA in the presence of TNF- in combination with IFN-.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	300	 However, the level of MCP-4 mRNA expression in IB3-1 cells was significantly lower than that observed in the non-CF airway epithelial cell lines BEAS2B and A549 stimulated in the same manner (32).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	301	 (14) observed that RANTES levels in the BALF of CF patients were significantly lower than RANTES levels in the BALF of asthmatics.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	302	 This report suggests that expression of RANTES by other cell types that express this chemokine, including T lymphocytes and macrophages, may be depressed in the CF lung.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	303	 At present, it is unclear what role RANTES may play in improving CF-associated airway inflammation and/or bacterial clearance of the CF lung.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	304	RANTES gene expression appears to be regulated at the level of transcription; the 3' untranslated region of RANTES mRNA does not contain an AU-repeat element, suggesting that RANTES mRNA expression is not regulated at the level of mRNA stability (25).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Results reported herein demonstrate that TNF- and IFN- synergize in the induction of RANTES expression in CF epithelial cells complemented with WT-CFTR and that WT-CFTR modulates RANTES promoter activation via NF-B.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	306	 The NF-B transcription factor family is composed of c-Rel, NF-B1 (p50), NF-B2 (p52), RelA (p65) and RelB (reviewed in Ref.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Most members of this family can form homo- or heterodimers that are retained in the cytoplasm of unactivated cells through interaction with members of the IB inhibitor family; members of the IB family include IB, IB, and IBR (3).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	308	 TNF- has been reported to induce rapid phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IB, allowing NF-B to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (3).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Interestingly, a recent paper by Ray and co-workers (21) suggests that RANTES and IL-8 are differentially regulated by NF-B.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	310	 These authors reported that overexpression of IBR in the alveolar epithelial cell line A549 sequesters p50 homodimers, thereby facilitating the binding of a unique NF-B-Rel complex to the RANTES B region; this binding, in turn, triggered a rapid 50- to 100-fold induction of RANTES upon cytokine stimulation compared with control cells (21).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	311	 However, IBR overexpression in A549 cells did not enhance gene expression of the chemokine IL-8 (21).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	312	It is possible that a loss of CFTR activity, i.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	313	, loss of chloride transport, in CF epithelial cells may alter the activity of transcription factors such as NF-B and the subsequent induction of RANTES gene expression.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Several studies have linked the activity of ion channels to immune responses in vivo (10, 11, 29).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Cahalan and Lewis (4) hypothesize that activating kinase-regulated chloride channels, such as CFTR, may result in the depolarization of the membrane potential and, thereby, may suppress mitogen-stimulated calcium influx.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	316	 (18) demonstrated that adding a permeable cAMP analog to T lymphocytes suppressed both calcium influx and NF-AT-mediated gene expression of IL-2 in response to T cell receptor activation.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The activity of transcription factors other than NF-AT, including c-Fos, has also been linked to membrane depolarization and calcium influx (29).
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	318	Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger the migration of leukocytes into the CF lung will be critical in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease.
0.41277942.10069998.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Moreover, determining how CFTR regulates the expression of chemokines, such as RANTES, will further the understanding of airway inflammation in general.

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, this processing mutant maintained functional Cl channel activity, presumably in the intracellular organelles, when reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The most notable difference between wild-type and 19 CFTR channels lies in the distribution of conductance states.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The deletion mutation caused frequent occurrence of a subconductance state within the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	234	The most common disease-causing mutation of CFTR is the deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508 CFTR).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Most of the F508 CFTR protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and fails to reach its intended site of action in the plasma membrane.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	236	 With regard to processing at 37  degrees C, 19 CFTR appears to be similar to F508 CFTR.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, F508 CFTR appears in the fully mature glycosylated form and can traffic to the plasma membrane following incubation at lower temperature (26-30  degrees C) (Fig.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Unlike F508 CFTR, the misprocessing of 19 CFTR is temperature-insensitive: the protein remained in the core-glycosylated state in intracellular organelles even at 26  degrees C.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The F508 CFTR proteins, once at the plasma membrane, give rise to functional Cl channels similar to those of wild-type CFTR in terms of open probability (26) and conductance state(24, 26) .

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Cardiac CFTR functions as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-regulated Cl channel with conduction properties similar to those of epithelial CFTR(9, 28) .

0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The strategy applied here to the study of CFTR channel function can be used to study even misprocessed or mislocalized channels and therefore ought to be applicable to the study of the effects of deleting exon 5 on CFTR channel function as well.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	245	The 19 amino acids deleted in 19 CFTR span a major part of the intracellular loop joining transmembrane segments IV and V.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This segment is highly hydrophilic, with about one-third of the residues being charged (two lysines and four glutamates).
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Several factors could account for the subconductance state associated with the 19 CFTR channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	248	One possibility is that retention of the 19 CFTR protein in intracellular membranes alters the function of the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Maturation of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane involves several processing and post-translational modifications (e.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	250	 The endoplasmic reticulum membrane contains other proteins, including various types of chaperons, that could interact with CFTR and alter the function of the Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	251	 However, the gating kinetics and open probability of the 19 CFTR channel in the intracellular membrane are similar to those of the wild-type CFTR channel in the plasma membrane, so the deletion of these 19 amino acids did not alter the essential function of the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Moreover, the wild-type CFTR channel occasionally enters the O2 subconductance state characteristic of the 19 CFTR channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These observations suggest that the subconductance state associated with the 19 CFTR Cl channel is probably an intrinsic property of the CFTR protein, but the deletion affects CFTR in such a way as to favor the O2 conductance state.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	254	A second possibility is that this loop interacts with other domains (nucleotide-binding folds, the regulatory domain, and other intracellular loops) in CFTR or with other cellular proteins that are involved in the conductance state transition.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Deletion of part of this loop might then affect the channel structure allosterically by changing these inter- or intramolecular interactions and thus induce a quasi-stable open configuration in addition to the full open state.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Understanding the distribution of subconductance states associated with the single Cl channel should provide valuable information about structure-function relationships in the CFTR Cl channel.
0.43596935.7499295.html.plaintext.txt	257	The approach reported here allows functional characterization of CFTR in any intracellular membranes besides the endoplasmic reticulum membrane(25) .

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   Erythrocytes (red blood cells) of either rabbits or healthy humans are required to demonstrate the participation of nitric oxide (NO) in the regulation of pulmonary vascular resistance in the isolated rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The property of the erythrocyte that is responsible for the stimulation of NO synthesis was reported to be the ability to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, including deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Moreover, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation of erythrocytes to ATP release has been described, and the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a component, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	6	, erythrocytes of individuals with CF do not release ATP in response to deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we investigated the hypothesis that, in contrast to those of healthy humans, erythrocytes of humans with CF fail to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report that CFTR is a component of the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The addition of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100  microM) produced increases in vascular resistance in isolated rabbit lungs perfused with physiological salt solution (PSS) containing erythrocytes of healthy humans, but L-NAME was without effect when the lungs were perfused with PSS alone or PSS containing erythrocytes of CF patients.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in CF, a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes could lead to decreased endogenous pulmonary NO synthesis and contribute to pulmonary hypertension.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	11	adenosine triphosphate; red blood cells; pulmonary circulation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	12	IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO) is produced by endothelial cells and, when released, relaxes vascular smooth muscle (10, 14, 19).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Physiologically, an alteration in shear applied to the endothelium of blood vessels has been suggested to be a major stimulus for NO release (3, 22).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, in the pulmonary circulation, a reappraisal of this viewpoint was required when it was reported that, in isolated rabbit (31) and rat (36, 38) lungs perfused with a physiological salt solution (PSS), alterations in shear stress alone did not evoke release of NO.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In contrast, when lungs of these species were perfused with either blood (36) or PSS containing washed erythrocytes (30, 38), inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis produced a shift in the slope of the pressure-flow relationship consistent with a decrease in vascular caliber, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	16	, NO was a determinant of vascular resistance.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The ability of the erythrocyte to stimulate NO synthesis in the pulmonary circulation of the rabbit and rat was reported to be independent of effects on viscosity or pressure (31, 36).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The property of the erythrocyte that was associated with the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis was shown to be the release of ATP (26, 28, 30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In support of the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the lung, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs produces vasodilation that is, in large part, dependent on the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Importantly, in addition to rabbit erythrocytes, human erythrocytes were reported both to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical deformation, and to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung (26).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recently, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation to ATP release from human and rabbit erythrocytes has been described (17, 18, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This pathway includes the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The activity of CFTR was shown to be required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes of both rabbits and humans (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is absent or markedly reduced, and rabbit erythrocytes incubated with inhibitors of CFTR activity failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Here, we demonstrate that CFTR is expressed in the membrane of both rabbit and human erythrocytes and that, in contrast to those of healthy humans, erythrocytes from humans with cystic fibrosis fail to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit pulmonary circulation.

0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	139	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   It was reported previously that erythrocytes from either rabbits (31), rats (36, 38), or healthy humans (26) are required for the demonstration of flow-induced NO synthesis in isolated perfused lungs.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	140	 These observations, coupled with the findings that physiological stimuli, such as mechanical deformation (18, 26, 27, 29), stimulate ATP release from erythrocytes and that ATP is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung (30), suggest a novel mechanism for the control of pulmonary vascular caliber.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In this construct, as the erythrocyte is deformed by increments in the velocity of blood flow through a vessel and/or by reductions in vascular caliber, it releases ATP, which stimulates endothelial synthesis of NO resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and, thereby, an increase in vascular caliber.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This vasodilation would then result in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance as well as a decrease in the stimulus for additional erythrocyte deformation and ATP release.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	143	 On the basis of this scheme, erythrocyte-derived ATP would contribute to the low vascular pressure in the healthy lung via stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	144	Recently, a signal transduction pathway that relates mechanical deformation to ATP release from erythrocytes of rabbits and humans has been described.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Components of this pathway include the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs (17) and Gi (18), adenylyl cyclase (29), PKA (29) and CFTR (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	146	 A role for CFTR in this pathway was suggested by reports that this member of the ATP binding cassette could facilitate the movement of ATP out of cells either by acting as an ATP conduit (21, 22) or by regulating another channel for ATP release (20, 23).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The finding that CFTR activity is lost or markedly diminished in humans with cystic fibrosis (5, 6) provided a unique opportunity for investigation of the role of CFTR in the release of ATP from erythrocytes in response to the physiological stimulus of mechanical deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	148	 It was reported previously that erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis as well as rabbit erythrocytes incubated with two chemically dissimilar inhibitors of CFTR, namely, glibenclamide (24, 25) and niflumic acid (7), failed to release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (27).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	149	A necessary step in establishing that CFTR is a component of a signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes is the demonstration of its presence in erythrocyte membranes.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Recently, it was shown that CFTR protein is present in erythrocyte membranes of both healthy humans and humans with cystic fibrosis (1, 32).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In addition, it was reported that human erythroblasts contain CFTR mRNA (37).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, it must be noted that neither CFTR protein in human erythrocytes nor mRNA in human erythroid progenitor cells were detected in another study (13).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In the present work, we confirm the finding that CFTR protein is a component of human erythrocyte membranes (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition, we show that the membranes of rabbit erythrocytes also possess CFTR (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Thus CFTR, a necessary component of a proposed signal transduction pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes, is present in the membranes of both rabbit and human erythrocytes, cells that release ATP in response to mechanical deformation (26, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	156	Although CFTR activity is required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes of humans (27), the loss of CFTR activity may have a different effect on basal ATP release from these cells.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	157	 It was reported that the concentration of ATP was increased in the blood of CFTR knockout mice as well as humans with cystic fibrosis compared with either wild-type controls or healthy humans, respectively (1).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	158	 It is important to note that, in these studies, ATP release was studied under quiescent conditions, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	159	, erythrocytes were not subjected to mechanical deformation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Thus it is possible that, although CFTR is required for deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes, another member of the ATP binding cassette, such as the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, is involved in basal ATP release from these cells (1).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	161	The hypothesis that ATP, released from erythrocytes of healthy humans in response to deformation, stimulates endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung is supported by previous studies.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Erythrocytes of healthy humans release ATP in response to mechanical deformation as would be encountered as they pass through the pulmonary circulation.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The amount of ATP released in response to deformation was shown to be stimulus dependent (26, 27, 29).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In addition, the inclusion of human erythrocytes in the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis (26).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Finally, the addition of ATP to the perfusate of isolated rabbit lungs resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in total pulmonary vascular resistance that were inhibited by pretreatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (30).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	166	In view of the findings that CFTR is expressed in human erythrocyte membranes, that it is a component of a signal transduction pathway that relates erythrocyte deformation to ATP release (27), and that ATP release from erythrocytes is a stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis in the rabbit pulmonary circulation (30), we hypothesized that erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which the activity of CFTR is defective, would fail to stimulate NO synthesis in the isolated perfused rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In the presence of washed erythrocytes from healthy humans, the administration of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME to the perfusate of isolated lungs resulted in a shift in the pressure-flow relationship in a manner consistent with an increase in Ohmic resistance (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This increase in vascular resistance was confined to the upstream vascular segment (PPA  to  PMV as a function of flow rate; Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In contrast, in the presence of erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis, L-NAME was without effect on the pressure-flow relationship, i.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	170	, NO was not a determinant of pulmonary vascular resistance (Fig.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	171	Several studies suggest that endogenous NO synthesis in the lung may be decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It was reported that amounts of NO detected in exhaled gas are decreased in humans with cystic fibrosis compared with healthy humans (2, 15, 35).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	173	 It must be recognized that the source of NO that is measured in exhaled gas is unknown and could derive from the endothelium of blood vessels, the airways, or other resident cells.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, it was reported that exhaled NO is reduced in neonates with cystic fibrosis before the development of detectable respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the decrease in exhaled NO is not the result of increased mucus accumulation and/or inflammation (9).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus the decrease in measurable NO in exhaled gas in cystic fibrosis patients compared with healthy controls could reflect, in part, the failure of erythrocyte-derived ATP to stimulate endogenous NO synthesis.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	176	Importantly, it was reported that isolated blood vessels obtained from lungs of humans with cystic fibrosis, when precontracted with phenylephrine, relaxed in response to the application of ADP, the first degradation product of ATP (8).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	177	 This response was shown to be endothelium dependent, although the nature of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor was not determined.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that if erythrocyte-derived ATP were released into the pulmonary circulation of humans with cystic fibrosis, endogenous NO synthesis could be stimulated.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	179	Failure of deformation-induced ATP release from erythrocytes and, thereby, the loss of a physiological stimulus for endogenous NO synthesis could be expected to lead, ultimately, to the development of pulmonary hypertension.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Pulmonary hypertension is seen in humans with cystic fibrosis; however, this condition has most often been attributed to the destructive lung disease and the subsequent loss of pulmonary capillaries and/or hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (11, 34).
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The results presented here suggest that a defect in ATP release from erythrocytes of cystic fibrosis patients as they traverse the pulmonary circulation could be an additional factor leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension in these individuals.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	182	In summary, we demonstrate that CFTR is a component of the erythrocyte membrane of rabbits and humans.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Erythrocytes from humans in whom this protein is functional stimulate endogenous NO synthesis in the isolated rabbit lung.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In contrast, erythrocytes of humans with cystic fibrosis, a condition in which CFTR activity is impaired, do not stimulate NO synthesis in this model.
0.41338694.15591098.html.plaintext.txt	185	 These findings provide support for the hypothesis that erythrocyte-derived ATP, released in response to a physiological stimulus, such as mechanical deformation, could serve to aid in the maintenance of normal pulmonary vascular resistance via the stimulation of endogenous NO synthesis.

0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	3	THE ABILITY OF NEWLY SYNTHESIZED PROTEINS, particularly oligomeric or multidomain proteins, to fold into unique, three-dimensional structures in vivo is dependent on their amino acid sequence and the activities of enzymes and molecular chaperone proteins that catalyze folding (9).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Evidence is accumulating that many human diseases are caused by improper folding of nascent polypeptides as they achieve a final three-dimensional structure.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Such proteins are either inactive or have altered activity as a result of inappropriate folding, as is the case in Marfan syndrome and familiar hypercholesterolemia, or are mislocalized due to trafficking defects arising from abnormal folding, as is the case for Tay-Sachs disease and 1-antitrypsin deficiency.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	6	Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) give rise to cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal autosomal genetic disease of Caucasians.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Deletion of the codon for phenylalanine-508 (F508) accounts for ~70% of all disease causing CF alleles (11) and yields a protein that is unable to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic to the plasma membrane where it functions normally as an ion channel.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Available evidence suggests that nascent F508-CFTR is a temperature-sensitive protein (4), which adopts a slightly altered protein conformation.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	9	 As such, it is recognized by ER quality control mechanisms as abnormal, leading to ER retention (3) (but see also Ref.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	10	 6) and ultimately to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (7).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Such retention appears, at least in part, to be due to the cellular chaperones, heat-shock protein Hsc70 and calnexin (10, 17).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The question of how to shield or dissociate mutant CFTR molecules from the ER quality control machinery and allow its exit to the plasma membrane has been the focus of research in several CF laboratories.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Because F508-CFTR retains some regulated chloride channel activity (16), correcting the folding and/or preventing the ER retention of mutant CFTR by chaperones may have therapeutic benefit for the treatment of CF.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	14	Attempts to pharmacologically manipulate the folding of F508-CFTR have included the use of protein stabilizing reagents, or chemical chaperones, such as glycerol and trimethylamine N-oxide, as well as deuterated water (2, 14).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Indeed, evidence suggests that such approaches can facilitate exit of F508-CFTR from the ER and insertion into the apical plasma membrane in vivo.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A previous publication by Rubenstein and colleagues (12) has shown that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) similarly facilitates exit of F508-CFTR from the ER, though the mechanism of action has remained elusive.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Previous work has shown that F508-CFTR remains associated with the cellular chaperone Hsc70 to a much greater extent than wild-type CFTR (17), an association that may direct mutant CFTR to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway (1).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the current article in focus (Ref.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	19	 13, see page C259 in this issue), Rubenstein and Zeitlin demonstrate that association of mutant CFTR with the heat-shock protein Hsc70 can be reduced by exposing cells to 4PBA.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Mechanistically, it appears that 4PBA inhibits the interaction of F508-CFTR with Hsc70, allowing mutant CFTR to escape targeting for degradation and facilitating its exit from the ER.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	21	 4PBA appears to do so by downregulating the expression of Hsc70 at the protein and mRNA level, thereby limiting the amount of Hsc70 that is available to bind to CFTR.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Such a hypothesis is consistent with the observations of Cheng and colleagues (5), who utilized deoxyspergualin, a compound that does not affect Hsc70 protein levels but competitively inhibits peptide binding to Hsc70, to partially restore CFTR function in heterologous cells expressing F508-CFTR.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It would appear, however, that the efficacious effects of inhibiting CFTR chaperone interactions are limited to Hsc70, since perturbation of CFTR-Hsc90 interactions have been shown to accelerate CFTR degradation (8).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	24	Manipulating CFTR folding by "chemical chaperones" does not appear to be readily feasible in the context of a CF patient.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, preventing the recognition of misfolded CFTR as abnormal may be amenable to pharmacological strategies.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Thus the current article by Rubenstein and Zeitlin offers exciting insight into how one might be able to disrupt cellular chaperone-dependent retention of mutant CFTR molecules in the ER, allowing their insertion into the plasma membrane.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, both 4PBA and deoxyspergualin are approved drugs for urea cycle disorders and antitumor/immunosuppression, respectively.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Indeed, clinical trials using 4PBA have suggested a small but significant improvement in nasal epithelial chloride transport in F508-homozygous CF patients.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, before such observations can be fully realized as therapies, several questions must be addressed.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	30	 For example, just how much mutant CFTR must escape from the ER quality control machinery to effect clinical benefit? The studies of Cheng and colleagues (5) would argue that the amount of mutant CFTR required to reach the plasma membrane to provide a measurable cAMP-sensitive chloride conductive pathway is less than which can be detected as mature CFTR protein by biochemical methods.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, since F508-CFTR does not retain full wild-type function, even after reaching the plasma membrane, further pharmacological activation of plasmalemmal resident mutant CFTR may be still required (15, 16).
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It remains to be determined what impact perturbation of the ER quality control machinery will have on protein folding and processing pathways for other proteins expressed in the cell.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, Hsc70 has other cellular functions, including the ATP-dependent uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles in the endocytic pathway and targeting of proteins for lysosomal degradation.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It is unclear what effects alterations in Hsc70 activity would have on these intracellular processes.
0.5620728.10666019.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Nevertheless, the ability to screen large libraries of compounds for drugs that disrupt CFTR-Hsc70 interactions may be fruitful in providing a pharmacological therapy for CF.

0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	3	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is caused by mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	4	 The most common mutation, F508, accounts for 70% of all CF alleles and results in a protein that is defective in folding and trafficking to the cell surface.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, F508-CFTR is functional when properly localized.

0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	12	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP- and protein kinase-regulated chloride channel found on the apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells (10).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Mutations within this gene lead to the CF phenotype that ultimately results in premature death primarily from a combination of chronic lung infections, loss of pulmonary function, and pancreatic insufficiency (5).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This genetic disease is among the most prevalent in the human population, occurring in ~1 of 2,500 Caucasian live births.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CFTR is a member of the structurally related ATP-binding cassette family of transmembrane transport proteins whose other members include P-glycoprotein (Pgp, the MDR1 gene product), multidrug resistance-associated protein and other related multidrug resistance proteins, and the sulfonylurea receptor (21).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	16	Of the more than 850 individual CFTR mutations leading to the CF phenotype that have been described, the most important is F508 (phenylalanine deletion at amino acid position 508), which is seen in ~70% of all CF patients.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The F508-CFTR mutation results in improper folding and trafficking of the CFTR protein, leading to its degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum by the 26S proteosome machinery of the cell (23).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, importantly, if this mutant protein is folded and expressed in the membrane by experimental cell culture techniques such as glycerol (20) or low temperature treatments (3), it functions normally as a chloride channel.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Moreover, it is estimated that restoration of functional CFTR expression to ~10% of normal levels would be sufficient to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease in vivo (19).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus there is great interest in development of strategies that can enhance F508-CFTR cell surface expression, which may be clinically useful in treatment of CF patients.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	21	There is evidence of coregulation of Pgp and CFTR in epithelial cells, although the mechanism and level of this overlapping regulation is currently unknown (2).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated both transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects of low-dose, noncytotoxic treatments with the cancer chemotherapy drugs mitomycin C (MMC) and doxorubicin (Dox) on expression of Pgp in various cell lines and in a mouse in vivo model (6, 7).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We therefore hypothesized that CFTR expression might also be modified by these or related drugs under similar treatment conditions.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We recently demonstrated that MMC increased total protein and cell surface functional expression of wild-type CFTR in HT-29 and T84 human colon cells (15a).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In this study, we investigated the effects of Dox on CFTR and F508-CFTR expression.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We report here that low-dose Dox (0.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	27	25  microM) significantly increased functional cell surface expression of CFTR and F508-CFTR in T84 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, respectively, and that this was primarily a result of posttranscriptional effects.

0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The reason for the lack of effect on either canine or human wild-type CFTR in these experiments is not clear, since wild-type CFTR expression had been affected in the T84 cells (Figs.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	181	 This may be due to the already high level of expression of CFTR in the MDCK cells as demonstrated by the fivefold increase in their chloride secretion compared with the parental MDCK cells expressing only the canine form (Fig.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Conversely, it may be that in these MDCK cells, there are two distinct pathways for normal and mutant CFTR protein trafficking, the latter of which is more Dox sensitive.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Several previous experimental cell culture procedures, such as high concentrations of glycerol, low-temperature incubation, or treatment with the xanthine drug, CPX, have been shown to be able to increase functional cell surface F508-CFTR expression (3, 4, 14).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Interestingly, these same treatments did not appear to affect wild-type CFTR expression in these cells, suggesting that these agents are targeting an alternative pathway specific for the mutant, misfolded protein rather than general trafficking of CFTR or other proteins (3, 4, 14).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus there may be differences in the efficiency of wild-type CFTR expression in these cells, e.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	186	, more CFTR may follow the alternative pathway in T84 cells, and therefore be available for "rescue" by Dox treatment compared with the MDCK cells.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In any event, Dox's lack of effect on functional expression of endogenous canine CFTR in the parental MDCK cells or on expression of the stably expressed normal human GFP-CFTR suggests that the change in chloride current in the GFP-F508-CFTR MDCK cells was principally a result of substantially increased cell surface expression of GFP-F508-CFTR from an essentially undetectable functional level.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	188	To further confirm the Isc and Western results, we then examined changes in GFP-F508-CFTR expression in the MDCK cells by immunoprecipitation.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	189	 4D, Dox increased the expression of F508-CFTR protein in these cells.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Large glycoproteins typically migrate at a reduced rate on denaturing gels and, as a result, the mature "C" band of GFP-F508-CFTR is detected at ~240 kDa rather than at 210 kDa as predicted.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Our laboratory had previously demonstrated a similar migration pattern for wild-type GFP-CFTR (17).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Taken together, these results demonstrate that a noncytotoxic dose of Dox can substantially increase the functional cell surface expression of F508-CFTR in epithelial cells.

0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	194	We report that a single, noncytotoxic dose of Dox increased the amount of functional CFTR in the plasma membrane of T84 cells and the amount of functional F508-CFTR in the plasma membrane of MDCK cells.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In the T84 cells, this appeared to be principally a posttranscriptional effect because there was little effect on CFTR mRNA expression.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In both cell models, Dox caused a significant increase in total cellular CFTR protein levels and a proportionate increase in CFTR-associated chloride secretion.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	197	 These results suggest that analogs may be identified that will be clinically useful in ameliorating the CF disease phenotype in human CF patients.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	198	The purpose of these studies was to obtain proof of principle for this class of drugs.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Although the exact mechanistic basis behind this effect is currently being investigated, one possibility is that Dox increases the stability of the F508-CFTR nascent forms, allowing them to fold properly.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Dox may alter the kinetics of F508-CFTR biogenesis influencing the interaction of the nascent protein with cellular chaperones.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Previous reports indicate that heat shock cognate protein (HSC70) facilitates the early steps of F508-CFTR biogenesis that appear to be important for maturation of the protein (22), and compounds that are capable of altering this association facilitate F508-CFTR (9) expression and chloride secretion.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Another possibility is that Dox directly interacts with and alters the folding, stability, or trafficking of F508-CFTR during its biogenesis.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	203	 For example, mutations in Pgp that alter its folding and plasma membrane trafficking, including a mutation that is comparable to F508-CFTR, can be corrected by treatment of cells with Pgp substrate drugs (15).
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The authors proposed that such drugs acted as "chemical chaperones" that interact with Pgp and allow proper folding of the nascent molecule to the functional, mature form.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	205	 A similar phenomenon could occur for F508-CFTR, although this same study indicated no effect of these treatments on F508-CFTR expression indicating that the effect was Pgp specific.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, anthracycline analogs were not tested in that study.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Other drugs have also been described that are capable of altering both CFTR and Pgp protein levels.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	208	 For example, butyrate compounds have been shown to be capable of stimulating both Pgp (16) and CFTR (18) protein expression.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We found that another cancer chemotherapy drug, mitomycin C, also increased functional cell surface expression of CFTR in T84 and HT-29 cells, although the effects were more modest than those of Dox (R.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	210	Alternatively, Dox may inhibit degradation of misfolded F508-CFTR, which might favor proper folding and maturation.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	211	 However, previous studies by Kopito and colleagues (11, 23) demonstrated that inhibition of the 26S proteosomal degradation pathway per se does not enhance F508-CFTR folding, but rather leads to aggregation.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Because other proteolytic pathways are involved in CFTR degradation (8), this possibility cannot be completely ruled out.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	213	 These and other possibilities remain to be explored in future studies.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	214	Perhaps most interestingly, a recent clinical observation was made (13) in a CF patient with F508-CFTR mutation in one allele and G673X stop mutation in the other allele who had fibrosarcoma.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This patient demonstrated significantly improved lung function and inhibition of his Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection after combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and the anthracycline epirubicin.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This is an intriguing clinical observation that should be further investigated systematically in CF cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	217	In this study, the Dox treatment regimen at which significant F508-CFTR effects were observed (0.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	218	25  microM) is more promising from a clinical pharmacology perspective.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This Dox concentration is ~20-fold lower that its LC50 in these cell systems, suggesting that one might also be able to achieve these effects in vivo at a comparably low dose that is well below those used in cancer chemotherapy and that can elicit significant "nontarget" toxicity.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Dox itself is unlikely to be useful in a CF clinical setting due to its cumulative systemic toxicity.
0.42004547.11287314.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, it is likely, given that there are thousands of anthracyclines and their derivatives that have been developed and characterized over the past 50 years, that analogs can be discovered or developed that share the beneficial properties of Dox in increasing F508-CFTR expression while avoiding its cumulative toxicities.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	6	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is a Cl- channel that belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette proteins.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The CFTR polypeptide comprises two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), and a regulatory (R) domain.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Gating of the channel is controlled by kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain and by ATP binding, and, likely, hydrolysis at the NBDs.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Exon 13 of the CFTR gene encodes amino acids (aa's) 590 to 830, which were originally ascribed to the R domain.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In this study, CFTR channels were severed near likely NH2- or COOH-terminal boundaries of NBD1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	11	 CFTR channel activity, assayed using two-microelectrode voltage clamp and excised patch recordings, provided a sensitive measure of successful assembly of each pair of channel segments as the sever point was systematically shifted along the primary sequence.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Substantial channel activity was taken as an indication that NBD1 was functionally intact.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This approach revealed that the COOH terminus of NBD1 extends beyond aa 590 and lies between aa's 622 and 634, while the NH2 terminus of NBD1 lies between aa's 432 and 449.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To facilitate biochemical studies of the expressed proteins, a Flag epitope was added to the NH2 termini of full length CFTR, and of CFTR segments truncated before the normal COOH terminus (aa 1480).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The functionally identified NBD1 boundaries are supported by Western blotting, coimmunoprecipitation, and deglycosylation studies, which showed that an NH2-terminal segment representing aa's 3 to 622 (Flag3-622) or 3 to 633 (Flag3-633) could physically associate with a COOH-terminal fragment representing aa's 634 to 1480 (634-1480); however, the latter fragment was glycosylated to the mature form only in the presence of Flag3-633.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Similarly, 433-1480 could physically associate with Flag3-432 and was glycosylated to the mature form; however, 449-1480 protein seemed unstable and could hardly be detected even when expressed with Flag3-432.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In excised-patch recordings, all functional severed CFTR channels displayed the hallmark characteristics of CFTR, including the requirement of phosphorylation and exposure to MgATP for gating, ability to be locked open by pyrophosphate or AMP-PNP, small single channel conductances, and high apparent affinity of channel opening by MgATP.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	23	 1989 ) has largely stood the test of time.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	24	 CFTR comprises two approximately homologous halves, each incorporating a putative hexa-helical transmembrane domain followed, in the linear sequence, by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	25	1 The two halves are linked by a charged, cytoplasmic, ~200-residue regulatory (R) domain that contains multiple sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (Riordan et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Apart from this large linker domain, CFTR's overall predicted domain structure identifies it as a member of the very large family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	27	 There are several other well-known eukaryotic ABC proteins such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multi-drug resistance-related protein (MRP), both associated with multi-drug resistance in tumor cells, and STE6, the a-mating factor transporter of yeast.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In all these examples, both membrane-spanning domains and the two NBDs are encoded by a single large gene.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	29	 But, in the much larger number of prokaryotic ABC transporters, the NBDs are frequently expressed from individual genes (as for HisP, the NBD of histidine permease; e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	30	 1998 ), or two NBDs may be fused in a single gene product (as for RbsA, the NBDs of the ribose transporter; e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	31	 1998 ), while the transmembrane domains may be expressed from yet other genes.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	32	 One implication of such post-translational assembly of functional transporters in bacteria is that these separate gene products (which, in many cases, are single domains) must each possess all the information needed to fold correctly and to interact with the complementary domains that make up a fully functioning transporter.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	33	Unlike any other ABC protein, CFTR functions as a chloride channel (reviewed in Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The R domain, with its multiple phosphorylation sites, is also unique to CFTR, and in its dephosphorylated state it prevents the opening of CFTR Cl- channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Even once it has been phosphorylated by PKA, however, a CFTR channel cannot open until it is exposed to ATP or another hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The regulation of opening and closing of CFTR channels by phosphorylation of the R domain and nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs is extremely complex and is not yet fully understood.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	37	 One suggestion is that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 results in both channel opening and binding of ATP at NBD2, which then stabilizes the open-channel conformation (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	38	, Csanady and Gadsby 1999 ; Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Recently, however, on the basis of direct comparisons of ATP hydrolysis and gating measurements of wild type and mutant CFTR, it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis might not be strictly coupled to channel opening (Ramjeesingh et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Still, it remains clear that interactions between the two NBDs, and between the NBDs and the R domain, play important roles in the gating of CFTR channels (reviewed in Csanady and Gadsby 1999 ; Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ; Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	41	Further dissection of these roles would greatly benefit from structural information on each of these domains, which is presently lacking.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nevertheless, peptide models of the R domain (Picciotto et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	43	 1992 ; Dulhanty and Riordan 1994 ), of the NH2-terminal NBD (NBD1; Hartman et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	44	 1992 ; Ko and Pedersen 1995 ; Yike et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	45	 1998 ), and of the COOH-terminal NBD (NBD2; Randak et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	46	 1997 ) have been expressed and partly characterized.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	47	 A valid concern with several of these constructs is the sparse knowledge of the location of the domain boundaries.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	48	 As a first step towards addressing this concern, we attempted to define the boundaries of NBD1 of CFTR by exploiting a functional approach.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	49	 It has already been shown that the CFTR channel protein can be severed near the COOH-terminal end of the R domain, and the two halves coexpressed to form a functional complex (Ostedgaard et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Therefore, given the modular design of ABC transporters in general, we reasoned that judicious cuts in the links flanking NBD1 ought to be tolerated.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Indeed, cuts between three of the four domains of STE6 did not abrogate its function (Berkower et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We describe here our search for the boundaries of NBD1 by coexpressing contiguous, or near contiguous, segments of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and assessing function with two-microelectrode voltage clamp and excised-patch recordings.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Expression and physical association of the CFTR protein segments were assayed using immunoblots and coimmunoprecipitation.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Using this approach, we find that the NH2 terminus of NBD1 lies between amino acids (aa) 432 and 449 and the COOH terminus lies between aa's 622 and 634.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Moreover, regions spanning aa's 415 to 432 and 634 to 667 can be omitted without severely impairing CFTR channel function.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Membrane conductance was monitored every minute or so with  plus or minus 60-mV steps away from the holding potential, which yielded negligibly small currents ( plus or minus 0.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	204	 By contrast, these voltage steps elicited clearly discernible currents of approximately  plus or minus 1  microA in unstimulated oocytes expressing WT CFTR (reflecting their mean basal conductance, 10  plus or minus  1  microS) and of approximately  plus or minus 10  microA (mean activated conductance, 173  plus or minus  4  microS) within ~2 min of stimulating the cAMP/PKA pathway in those oocytes by exposing them to 50  microM forskolin plus 1 mM IBMX (Fig 1 and Table 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The steady current levels near the ends of 1-s voltage pulses to potentials between -100 and +80 mV are shown in the steady state current to voltage plots in Fig 1 D.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	206	 For oocytes expressing WT CFTR, these I-V relationships were approximately linear, and showed roughly the same reversal potential, both before and during stimulation of PKA (Fig 1 D, c and d).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In oocytes expressing WT CFTR, but not in uninjected oocytes, subsequent injection of the PKA inhibitor RpcAMPS (estimated final concentration, ~1 mM) diminished the basal conductance until it matched that of H2O-injected, or of uninjected, oocytes (Csanady, L.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Gadsby, manuscript submitted for publication).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This indicates that the basal conductance reflected activity of WT-CFTR channels phosphorylated by basally active PKA, and that phosphatases must also have been constitutively active in the oocytes to dephosphorylate CFTR channels and abolish their basal activity after introduction of RpcAMPS.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Accordingly, the forskolin- and IBMX-induced increase in membrane conductance of oocytes expressing CFTR presumably reflected activation of CFTR by PKA-mediated phosphorylation (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	211	 1993 ) and possibly also a direct stimulation of CFTR by IBMX (Al-Nakkash and Hwang 1999 ).

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The initial suggestion was that exon 13 of CFTR, comprising aa's 590 to 830, encoded the R domain, and hence that the exon 12/13 junction marked the boundary between NBD1 and the R domain (Riordan et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	215	 If that were so, it might reasonably be expected that functional CFTR channels could be reconstituted by coexpression of the two contiguous segments of CFTR severed between residues 589 and 590; i.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The NH2-terminal Flag epitope was incorporated to facilitate immunoprecipitation and detection of the expressed proteins (see below).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Injection of oocytes with a mixture of the two cRNAs encoding these two segments resulted in conductances that were negligible under both basal (2  plus or minus  1  microS) and activated (2  plus or minus  1  microS) conditions, just as in control, uninjected oocytes (Fig 2 and Table 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	218	 On the assumption that NBD1 likely stretches beyond aa 589 (compare Annereau et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	219	 1997 ), a series of constructs was made in which the COOH terminus of Flag3-589 was incrementally extended.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Each of these constructs in turn was coexpressed with the 590-1480 segment, and basal and activated conductances were measured to assess channel function (Fig 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These conductances mimicked those of uninjected oocytes until the Flag-tagged CFTR segment was extended to aa 633.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Thus, basal and activated conductances were 2  plus or minus  1 and 3  plus or minus  1  microS for oocytes injected with Flag3-622 plus 590-1480, but jumped to 8  plus or minus  1 and 91  plus or minus  7  microS in oocytes coexpressing Flag3-633 plus 590-1480.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	223	 However, the basal and activated conductances produced by Flag3-633 plus 590-1480 constructs were both smaller than those attained by WT CFTR (Fig 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Speculating that this shortfall might be attributable to the repetition of residues 590 to 633 upon coexpression of Flag3-633 plus 590-1480, we removed the overlapping residues by coexpressing Flag3-633 with segment 634-1480, and found basal and activated conductances of 17  plus or minus  1 and 182  plus or minus  4  microS, respectively, comparable with those of oocytes expressing WT CFTR (Fig 1, B to D, and 2; Table 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	225	These results show that robust CFTR channel function is obtained when the COOH terminus of the segment Flag3-589 is extended to aa 633 (but not to aa 622) and when that construct is coexpressed with the appropriate complementary segment, suggesting that the COOH terminus of NBD1 lies between aa's 622 and 634.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	226	 (In other words, it could lie at aa 623, or 624, or 625, etc.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	227	, but could extend as far as aa 633.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	228	) An alternative possibility, that a crucial part of NBD1 extends beyond aa 633 but can nevertheless associate with the Flag3-633 segment to form a complete NBD1 domain, is rendered unlikely by our finding that strong CFTR channel activity was reconstituted by coexpression of Flag3-633 with 668-1480: despite this omission of the 34-residue segment aa's 634 to 667, basal and activated conductances (16  plus or minus  1 and 175  plus or minus  7  microS, respectively; Fig 2 and Table 1) were similar to those of WT CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	229	 On the other hand, oocytes coexpressing Flag3-622 plus 634-1480, in which any CFTR channels must lack aa's 623 to 633, displayed negligible basal and activated conductances like those of uninjected oocytes.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	230	Defining the NH2-terminal Boundary of NBD1 We used a similar strategy to incrementally extend the NH2 terminus of segment 590-1480 in an attempt to build a complete NBD1 there.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Upon coexpression with Flag3-589, the extended segment 449-1480 yielded conductances indistinguishable from those of uninjected oocytes, but extended segment 433-1480 gave substantial activated (129  plus or minus  12  microS) conductance, though still smaller than that of WT CFTR-injected oocytes (Fig 3).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	232	 However, omission of the overlapping section (residues 433 to 589) by coexpression of Flag3-432 plus 433-1480 resulted in somewhat larger basal (6  plus or minus  1  microS) and activated (157  plus or minus  5  microS) conductances that approached those of oocytes expressing WT CFTR channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The fact that coexpression of Flag3-432 plus 449-1480 yielded no functional channels confirms that segment 433-448 is an essential part of NBD1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	234	 In contrast, coexpression of Flag3-414 plus 433-1480, which effectively deleted the 18-residue segment aa's 415 to 432, nevertheless resulted in oocytes that displayed basal and activated conductances (7  plus or minus  1 and 195  plus or minus  5  microS, respectively) comparable with those of oocytes expressing intact CFTR (Fig 2 and Table 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	235	 These data suggest that the NH2-terminal boundary of NBD1 lies between aa's 432 and 449.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	236	As a control test, each individual segment of CFTR used to investigate the functional boundaries of NBD1 was expressed by itself in oocytes, and basal and activated conductances were measured in the usual manner.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In all cases, the resulting conductances were similar to those of uninjected oocytes (Fig 4), confirming that none of these truncated CFTR fragments readily forms viable channels when expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	238	Expression and Maturation of Severed CFTR Segments Western blots of proteins resolved from whole oocyte membrane preparations were used to evaluate expression of intact or truncated CFTR proteins.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	239	 As expected, the R-domain antibody did not recognize the Flag3-622 or Flag3-633 segments (Fig 5 A, lanes 1 and 2), but did detect a single sharp band of ~95 kD (Fig 5 A, lane 3, thin arrow) when segment 634-1480 was expressed alone.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	240	 However, an additional broad band of ~150 kD appeared when 634-1480 was coexpressed with Flag3-633 (Fig 5 A, lane 5, fat arrow), implying that segment 634-1480 was then glycosylated.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Accordingly, the ~95-kD band could be digested to a perceptibly smaller band of ~90 kD (Fig 5 C, thin arrows) by either endoglycosidase-H or N-glycosidase-F, whereas the broad ~150-kD (Fig 5 C, fat arrow) band was insensitive to endoglycosidase-H, but was largely digested to a ~90-kD band after treatment with N-glycosidase-F (Fig 5 C).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Because endoglycosidase-H may be expected to remove glycosyl moieties only from proteins not yet modified by the early Golgi enzyme mannosidase II, whereas N-glycosidase-F removes all asparagine-linked glycosyl groups, these results argue that the ~90-kD band corresponds to the deglycosylated form of segment 634-1480, while the ~95- and ~150-kD bands correspond to its core glycosylated and fully glycosylated forms, respectively.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This, in turn, suggests that segment 634-1480 was merely core glycosylated when expressed alone (Fig 5 A, lane 3), but could be fully glycosylated when it was coexpressed with the contiguous segment Flag3-633 (Fig 5 A, lane 5).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Together with the several-fold increase in density of the 634-1480 signal in the presence of Flag3-633 (compare lanes 3 and 5), these findings indicate that maturation and stabilization of segment 634-1480 are promoted by its coexpression with an appropriate complementary segment such as Flag3-633.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Interestingly, however, the ~150-kD band was not detected when segment 634-1480 was coexpressed with Flag3-622 (Fig 5 A, lane 4).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This, despite the fact that the Flag3-633 and Flag3-622 segments, detected by the anti to Flag M2 antibody as single narrow bands (Fig 5 B), were both expressed at similar levels, and at almost the same level whether expressed alone or coexpressed with 634-1480.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Thus, although removal of the eleven residues (aa's 623 to 633) from Flag3-633 did not affect the stability of the resulting segment, Flag3-622 (Fig 5 B, lanes 2 and 5 vs.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	248	 1 and 4), this deletion abrogated the ability of that segment to promote glycosylation of the coexpressed fragment, 634-1480 (Fig 5 A, lane 5 vs.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	249	 These data indicate that completion of the COOH terminus of segment Flag3-622 by some or all of aa's 623 to 633 is required for productive interaction with segment 634-1480, which, in turn, seems essential for maturation of the resulting complex.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This is consistent with the conclusion from the functional measurements, using two-electrode voltage clamp, that the COOH terminus of NBD1 lies between residues 622 and 634.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	251	Similarly, the R-domain antibody did not detect the Flag3-432 segment (which lacks an R domain; Fig 6 A, lane 1), but recognized segment 433-1480, which, when expressed alone, gave a sharp band at ~125 kD (Fig 6 A, lane 2, thin arrow).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Coexpression of 433-1480 with Flag3-432 (Fig 6 A, lane 5) yielded that same band (thin arrow), together with an additional, broader band (fat arrow) of ~160 kD (together with weak degradation bands ~70 to 75 kD), consistent with glycosylation of segment 433-1480.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Indeed, after treatment with either endoglycosidase-H or N-glycosidase-F the lower (~125-kD) Mr band migrated as a slightly smaller fragment of ~120 kD (Fig 6 B, thin arrows).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	254	 On the other hand, the higher (~160-kD; Fig 6 B, fat arrow) Mr band was insensitive to endoglycosidase-H, but was converted to a ~120-kD band by N-glycosidase-F.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	255	 It seems, then, that the ~120-kD band represents the unglycosylated form of segment 433-1480, while the ~125- and the ~160-kD bands represent its core glycosylated and fully glycosylated forms.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	256	 However, hardly any protein was detected (over the range ~45 to ~180 kD) by the R-domain antibody when segment 449-1480 was expressed alone (Fig 6 A, lane 3).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Even when it was coexpressed with the Flag3-432 segment, only a relatively weak band of ~70 kD could be detected, presumably representing a degraded form of 449-1480 protein (Fig 6 A, lane 4, *).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	258	 So, it appears that the stability of 449-1480 protein was slightly increased in the presence of Flag3-432, although no glycosylated form of 449-1480 was observed.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus, deletion of aa's 433 to 448 from 433-1480 yielded a segment that seemed highly unstable, even when coexpressed with a complementary segment of CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	260	 These biochemical findings support our conclusion from the electrophysiological assays of function that the NH2 terminus of NBD1 lies between residues 432 and 449.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	261	Physical Association between Complementary Fragments Starts in the Endoplasmic Reticulum Coimmunoprecipitation tests were made using anti to Flag M2 affinity beads to evaluate physical association between Flag-tagged NH2-terminal segments of CFTR and complementary COOH-terminal segments in membrane extracts from oocytes coinjected with cRNAs encoding severed CFTR molecules.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Both segments Flag3-622 and Flag3-633 (detected with an antibody against an epitope near CFTR's NH2 terminus; Fig 7 A, bottom, lanes 2 and 3) were able to coimmunoprecipitate the core glycosylated (~95-kD; thin arrow) form of segment 634-1480 (top, lanes 2 and 3).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	263	 However, the fully glycosylated (~150-kD; fat arrow) form of 634-1480 was coimmunoprecipitated only with Flag3-633 (Fig 7 A, top, lane 3) and not with Flag3-622 (lane 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Because the immunoprecipitation was via the Flag tag, it appears that both Flag3-622 and Flag3-633 segments associate with the core glycosylated segment 634-1480 (Fig 7 A, top, lanes 2 and 3, thin arrow), presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but only the Flag3-633 plus 634-1480 complex proceeds to the Golgi compartment, and eventually to the cell surface membrane as a mature, fully glycosylated channel.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The Flag3-622 plus 634-1480 complex (Fig 7 A, lane 2), on the other hand, does not appear to leave the ER.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	266	Correspondingly, immunoprecipitation of segment Flag3-432 (detected with the anti to NH2-terminal antibody; Fig 7 B, bottom, lanes 1 and 2) resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of both core-glycosylated (thin arrow) and fully glycosylated (fat arrow) forms of segment 433-1480 (top, lane 2), but of little or no protein corresponding to segment 449-1480 (top, lane 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The latter result corroborates the conclusion from the Western blot of Fig 6 A that segment 449-1480 appears to be rapidly degraded in the oocyte.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Coimmunoprecipitation (using the anti to Flag beads) of both immature and mature forms of 433-1480 (Fig 7 B, top, lane 2, thin and fat arrows), however, demonstrates that segments Flag3-432 and 433-1480 physically associate with each other, and that this association takes place in the ER (or, at the latest, in the early Golgi compartment).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	269	 These data indicate that the complementary pairs of CFTR segments that constitute functional channels, whether severed just before or just after the intact NBD1, begin their association in the ER before proceeding through the Golgi to the cell membrane, whereas segment pairs that do not comprise an intact NBD1 fail to exit the ER.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	270	The NH2-terminal Flag Epitope Lowers the Po of CFTR Channels by Slowing Opening Forskolin activates CFTR channels indirectly via a pathway that involves adenylyl cyclase and PKA holoenzyme, and, in the oocyte, such activation appears to be subject to saturation (Csanady, L.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Gadsby, manuscript submitted for publication).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Moreover, IBMX at millimolar concentrations likely directly stimulates CFTR channel activity (Al-Nakkash and Hwang 1999 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Both of these facts make our two-microelectrode recordings only coarse assays of the function of CFTR channels, whether intact or severed, expressed in oocytes.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	274	 We therefore directly activated the channels by applying catalytic subunit of PKA to the cytoplasmic surface of inside-out patches excised from the oocytes, and evaluated their behavior in detail.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Also, because the NH2-terminal CFTR segments described so far had all been tagged with the Flag M2 epitope, we characterized the unitary currents of the three representative channel types, WT CFTR, CFTR severed just before NBD1, and CFTR severed just after NBD1, in each case with and without the Flag tag (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The representative recordings in Fig 8 show that WT and Flag-WT CFTR channels share several of the accepted hallmark characteristics, such as single-channel conductance, the requirement for ATP and prior phosphorylation by PKA for channel activity, relatively slow channel gating (interburst and burst durations on the order of seconds), and locking of the channels in the open state by PPi or by AMPPNP (data not shown).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	277	 However, kinetic analysis revealed that the Po of Flag-WT was ~1/3 that of WT (Fig 9 and Table 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	278	 This reduction in Po was not due to any change in mean burst duration (i.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	279	, in closing rate), but rather reflected an approximately threefold prolongation of the mean interburst duration (i.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	280	, approximately threefold lower opening rate) of Flag-WT compared with WT channels (Fig 9).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Comparable results were obtained when the severed CFTR channels Flag3-432 plus 433-1480 and Flag3-633 plus 634-1480 were compared with their Flag-less counterparts (Fig 9).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	282	 As evident from the recordings in Fig 8, all of these constructs displayed the same general channel characteristics as listed above for WT CFTR channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Despite this broad similarity, both of the severed CFTR channels containing the NH2-terminal Flag showed interburst durations two- to threefold longer than those of the corresponding Flag-less severed CFTR channels (Fig 9 and Table 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Therefore, the Flag epitope added to the NH2 terminus of CFTR significantly reduces channel Po by selectively slowing channel opening.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	291	Severing CFTR between NBD1 and the R Domain Lowers Po by Speeding Channel Closing The more interesting question is whether severing CFTR, either just before or just after NBD1, affects channel gating.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The results of the kinetic analysis (Fig 9 and Table 2) demonstrate that severed channels formed from segments 1-432 plus 433-1480 had a Po, a mean burst duration, and a mean interburst duration that were not significantly different from those of WT CFTR channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Furthermore, this similarity was not influenced by addition of the Flag epitope, since severed channels formed from Flag3-432 plus 433-1480 segments showed Po, and burst and interburst durations, closely similar to those of Flag-WT channels (Fig 9 and Table 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	294	 However, severed channels formed from CFTR segments 1-633 plus 634-1480 had a smaller Po than WT or 1-432 plus 433-1480 channels, attributable to a reduced burst duration (i.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	295	, to an increased closing rate).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	296	 This effect of severing CFTR channels just after NBD1 was independent of the presence or absence of the Flag epitope, because the mean burst duration of channels comprising segments Flag3-633 plus 634-1480 was significantly shorter than that of either Flag-WT or Flag3-432 plus 433-1480 channels (Fig 9 and Table 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	297	 These findings indicate that severing CFTR just before NBD1 has no measurable effect on channel Po or gating kinetics, whereas severing CFTR between NBD1 and the R domain leads to a reduction in Po due to an increase in channel closing rate.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	298	Neither Adding the Flag Epitope, nor Severing CFTR before or after NBD1, Affects Single-Channel Conductance or the Apparent Affinity for ATP To verify that neither incorporating the Flag epitope nor severing CFTR before or after NBD1 causes a major structural alteration in the channel pore, we measured single-channel conductances of WT and Flag-WT CFTR channels, and of severed channels formed from segments 1-432 plus 433-1480, or Flag3-432 plus 433-1480, or 1-633 plus 634-1480, or Flag3-633 plus 634-1480, in excised patches exposed to symmetrical 140 mM Cl- solutions.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Under these conditions, as illustrated for WT and for 1-432 plus 433-1480 channels, each channel type was characterized by an ohmic single-channel conductance: its average magnitude was ~7 pS and there was no significant difference between the conductance of WT CFTR channels and that of any of the other constructs (P = 0.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	307	Assuming that a step after binding of ATP at one of the NBDs rate limits channel opening (see Csanady and Gadsby 1999 ; Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ; Zeltwanger et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	308	 1999 ), there are two possible explanations for the observation that opening rate, and hence Po, are decreased in Flag-tagged CFTR channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This decrease could result from a reduction either in the binding affinity for ATP at that site, or in the rate of a step after binding (such as a step related to hydrolysis, or transmission of the gating conformational change to the pore).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	310	 To distinguish between these two possibilities, for each CFTR construct we measured macroscopic currents in large patches containing many channels, and compared the current magnitude during a test exposure to 50  microM MgATP with that obtained at 2 mM MgATP, just before and after the test (Fig 11).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The ratio of these currents (I50 microM/I2mM) provides a rough measure of apparent affinity for ATP because, for all constructs, 2 mM MgATP proved to be a saturating concentration; thus, I1mM/I2mM ratios were 1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	312	03 for Flag3-432+433-1480, and 1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Both the representative macroscopic current records for each of these constructs and the bar graph summary (Fig 11) show that the I50 microM/I2mM ratios were all very similar and close to 0.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Hence, the observed reduction in Po after addition of the Flag epitope to the NH2 terminus of CFTR (Fig 9) is likely to reflect slowing of a rate-limiting step after ATP binding.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	323	 This is because residues 415-432 in CFTR align (Fig 12, below) with those comprising the first ss strand in the recently solved high-resolution structures of HisP, the NBD of histidine permease (from Salmonella typhimurium; Hung et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	324	 1998 ), and of the NH2-terminal NBD in RbsA, which incorporates the two NBDs of the ribose transporter (from Escherichia coli; Armstrong et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Although the sequences of these three NBDs (NBD1 of CFTR, NH2-terminal NBD of RbsA, and HisP) share only on the order of 20% identity, largely restricted to the highly conserved ABC signature sequence and to the Walker A and B sequences (Walker et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	326	 1982 ), because the latter both contribute to the active site, and yet are separated by ~140 residues in HisP, this large distance strongly constrains alignments of different NBD sequences (Hung et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Moreover, despite the small degree of identity, the catalytic site architectures of HisP and RbsA are closely similar: both resemble an open cup, formed by a broken ss-barrel, within which the nucleotide binds (Hung et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	328	 In both crystal structures, a conserved aromatic residue, Tyr16 in HisP and Phe14 in RbsA, located at the end of the first ss strand (Fig 12, below), makes extensive hydrophobic contact with the adenine base of the bound nucleotide and, at least in HisP, seems crucial for nucleotide binding (Shyamala et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Depending on the alignment, the corresponding residue in NBD1 of CFTR is likely to be Leu435 (Fig 12, below; compare Hung et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Insofar as the structure of NBD1 in CFTR resembles those of HisP and RbsA, the deletion of aa's 415 to 432 may be expected to remove the entire first ss strand, which, in turn, through its proximity to Phe433 and Leu435, would be anticipated to influence nucleotide binding.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	331	 To see whether this deletion affects the apparent affinity for ATP activation of channel Po, we measured the ratio I50 microM/I2mM for Flag3-414+433-1480 CFTR channels in macropatches (Fig 11).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	332	 This ratio was found to be close to 0.

0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	346	In this work, we have demonstrated that physical and functional association of complementary segments of CFTR, severed just before or after NBD1, results in split channels with microscopic properties closely similar to those of intact WT CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Further, by systematically shifting the sever point, we have been able to define the domain boundaries of NBD1 to within 10 to 15 amino acids.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	348	 The newly defined boundaries have important ramifications for structural and functional studies of CFTR's NBDs, whether as isolated polypeptides or in their native state, incorporated into full-length CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	349	That a severed membrane transport protein may nevertheless function has been demonstrated previously.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	350	 coli cells expressing both putative hexahelical halves of lac permease, severed within its central cytoplasmic loop, transport lactose at about one third the rate of cells expressing intact permease, but no transport is seen in cells expressing either half alone (Bibi and Kaback 1990 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Similarly, coexpression in Xenopus oocytes of up to three complementary segments (severed within cytoplasmic or extracellular loops) comprising the full-length human erythrocyte anion exchanger (band 3, or AE1) resulted in Cl- influx levels comparable with those observed after expression of intact WT band 3 (Groves et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Although the domain organization of band 3 is not yet known, it is remarkable that the protein backbone can be cut at at least four sever points (and at at least two of them simultaneously) with little detectable loss of Cl- transport function.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	353	 It is perhaps less surprising that a known multidomain protein like the voltage-gated Na channel, which has four repeats, each with six putative membrane-spanning helices, can still function with a single cut between two repeats (at least, in two of the three linking loops; Stuhmer et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Eukaryotic ABC transporters are also multidomain proteins with homologous internal repeats, a consequence of their evolution from prokaryotic ancestors in which the individual domains are often expressed from separate genes (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	355	 So it is not surprising that ABC molecules such as the yeast a-factor transporter, STE6, can also function when coexpressed as two separate halves (Berkower and Michaelis 1991 ), nor that coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that those two halves physically interact (Berkower et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Representatives of the two families of multidrug-resistance ABC proteins, Pgp (Loo and Clarke 1994 ) and MRP (Gao et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	357	 1996 ) have also been shown to survive being cut in half, between NBD1 and the second transmembrane domain, and to retain at least partial function: severed MRP transported substrate at least a third as well as intact MRP (a fraction possibly simply reflecting the efficiency of simultaneous transfection of the insect cells used; Gao et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	358	 1996 ), whereas severed Pgp supported substrate-induced ATPase activity about half that of intact Pgp, but showed no sign of drug transport in NIH-3T3 cells, possibly due to defective trafficking to the cell membrane (Loo and Clarke 1994 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Physical and functional association between NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of CFTR (residues 1-835 and 837-1480; cut after the R domain) was demonstrated by Ostedgaard et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	360	 1997 , who found that the severed construct supported intracellular cAMP-activated anion fluxes, assayed by measurements of SPQ fluorescence, that were comparable with those of WT CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	361	Assaying the function of severed molecules to define domain boundaries is an approach well suited to multidomain, single-gene eukaryotic ABC transporters, because individual domains may each correspond to the product of a single ancestral gene and may therefore reasonably be expected to be capable of folding separately.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Indeed, there are already several examples of putative links between domains of such eukaryotic ABC proteins being severed without destroying the molecule's overall function (as described above).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	363	 In general, if severing the backbone of a protein does not detectably impair its function, it is reasonable to conclude that covalent linkage at that point is not required for the assayed function.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	364	 It may further be concluded either that the cut occurs between functional domains, or that the sever point lies within such a domain but the native fold and function are nevertheless retained (Shiba and Schimmel 1992 ; Betton and Hofnung 1994 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	365	 However, the latter possibility becomes far less likely if function remains intact when a substantial deletion is introduced on one side or the other of the sever point.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	366	 That was precisely our finding when we effectively deleted the 18-residue segment 415-432 (by coexpressing Flag3-414 plus 433-1480; Fig 3) from the NH2-proximal side of NBD1, or the 34-residue segment 634-667 (by coexpressing Flag3-633 plus 668-1480; Fig 2) from the COOH-proximal side of NBD1 (Fig 12, gray).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	367	 In contrast, we could detect neither function nor mature protein when we simply introduced a single cut (Fig 12, red) only 16 or 11 residues away from those deletions, respectively, but in the direction of the conserved core of the domain.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Therefore, the domain boundaries of NBD1 of CFTR, as defined by the assays of microscopic function used here, can be confidently assigned to lie within residues 433 to 448 and 623 to 633 at the NH2 and COOH termini of NBD1, respectively.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	369	In the present work, we have made detailed single-channel measurements that show that individual severed CFTR channels, cut just before (1-432 plus 433-1480) or after (1-633 plus 634-1480) NBD1, have the same unitary conductance as WT CFTR channels (Fig 10) and almost identical microscopic gating characteristics in the presence of PKA catalytic subunit (Fig 9).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Both severed constructs had the same opening rate as WT channels, and the same apparent affinity for activation of channel Po by MgATP, and both were locked open by PPi (Fig 8) or AMPPNP.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Only the closing rate of channels cut after NBD1 differed from that of WT, and was ~40% faster, indicating that the bursting state is somewhat destabilized by that cut, due to a slight acceleration of the rate-limiting step for channel closing (likely reflecting speeding of the slowest step in the ATP hydrolysis cycle at NBD2; Csanady et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Thus, we can conclude that the normal gating function of NBD1 (which we and others infer to be control of channel opening; for reviews, see, e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	373	, Csanady and Gadsby 1999 ; Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ) does not depend on its covalent linkage either to the first transmembrane domain or to the R domain, since the maximal opening rates are the same for intact channels as for channels cut before or after NBD1 (Fig 9).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Nor does channel opening require segments 415-432 (Fig 3 and Fig 11) or 634-667 (Fig 2).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	375	 On the other hand, we found a consistent and significant effect of incorporating the eight-residue Flag tag at the NH2 terminus of CFTR, which reproducibly slowed channel opening approximately two- to threefold, resulting in an approximately two- to threefold reduction in Po for both severed and intact constructs, without affecting the mean burst duration, conductance, or locking of any of the channels.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	376	 It is notable that attaching the 238-residue green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the NH2 terminus of CFTR was found to affect neither single-channel conductance (assayed in bilayers) nor macroscopic whole-cell conductance in transfected NIH-3T3 cells (Moyer et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	377	 But it remains unclear whether channel Po was affected by the large GFP tag, because the bilayer experiments did not address channel number or gating kinetics, and no comparison was made between the levels of CFTR protein expressed in cells transfected with WT CFTR and those transfected with GFP-CFTR.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Interestingly, an interaction between an acidic region of CFTR's NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail and the R domain was recently demonstrated, which stabilized the open state of the channel (Naren et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	379	 1999 ); disrupting the interaction by mutating the acidic residues resulted in shorter bursts.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	380	 It is not yet clear whether, or how, that finding relates to our observation here that incorporation of the largely acidic Flag at the NH2 terminus of CFTR stabilized the channel closed state (both for intact and severed channels).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	381	 We have found, however, that this effect is also mediated via the R domain, since addition of an NH2-terminal Flag does not alter the opening rate of severed CFTR channels from which the entire R domain (aa's 634 to 836) is missing (Csanady, L.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Gadsby, manuscript submitted for publication).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	383	None of the half-molecule constructs gave measurable basal or activated Cl- conductance in two-microelectrode recordings of macroscopic currents, regardless of whether the oocytes were expressing the NH2-terminal half with (construct Flag3-835; not illustrated) or without (Flag3-633; Fig 4) the R domain, or the COOH-terminal half with (CFTR construct 634-1480; Fig 4) or without (construct 837-1480; not illustrated) the R domain.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	384	 However, because we did not record from patches excised from those oocytes, we cannot rule out the possibility that an extremely low density of channels might be formed from certain half molecules.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Our macroscopic current results contrast with a recent report that expression of only the COOH-terminal half of CFTR, either with or without the R domain, gave macroscopic, intracellular cAMP-activated, whole-cell currents in injected oocytes and in transfected IB3 cells, as well as unitary currents activated by PKA and ATP in patches excised from the IB3 cells (Devidas et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Although a major procedural difference was the injection of 50 ng cRNA per construct in those experiments (vs.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	387	5 ng in ours), it seems unlikely that protein expression was correspondingly high because the activated conductance of WT CFTR was only 10  microS (Devidas et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	388	 1998 ), more than 20-fold smaller than the average in the present experiments (Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 3, Table 1).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	389	 1994 did observe channel currents in patches excised from HeLa cells expressing just the NH2-terminal half of CFTR truncated after the R domain (segment 1-835), though channel formation was far less efficient than for WT CFTR, which presumably accounts for the fact that no change in SPQ fluorescence could be detected when the same cells were challenged with cAMP-elevating cocktail (Ostedgaard et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	390	How do the boundaries of CFTR's NBD1 that we have functionally defined here compare with the crystal structures of the HisP and RbsA NBDs, whose close similarity to each other supports their being considered reasonable models for the structure of all ABC NBDs, including those of CFTR? Although the safe boundaries of CFTR's NBD1 (433-633) circumscribe only 200 residues, whereas the crystallized NBDs of HisP and RbsA included 259 and 241 residues, respectively, they still compare reasonably well because alignments (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	391	 1998 ) indicate that NBD1 of CFTR lacks a stretch of 20 to 30 amino acids present in the other NBDs.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Moreover, the safe sever points can be rationalized on the basis of such alignments.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Thus, Phe433 would be predicted to occur near the end of the first ss strand (Fig 12), some distance from the -phosphate of bound ATP (although nearby Leu435, if not Phe433 itself, is implicated in binding of the nucleotide base; see Hung et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	394	 1998 ), and Leu633 would be expected to occur after the final ss strand in the NBD structure, between it and a pair of final helices (arranged slightly differently in HisP and RbsA).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	395	 In contrast, the nontolerated sever point Glu449 occurs just before a highly conserved glycine that in HisP and RbsA begins a ss strand at the center of the ss sheet that forms the major wall of the active site, where severing might be anticipated to disrupt its structure.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	396	 At the COOH terminus, Gly622 is predicted to lie in the loop connecting the last two (antiparallel) ss strands of that large ss sheet, where severing might perturb stabilizing interactions between those two strands.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Overall, that the structures of HisP and RbsA afford reasonable interpretations of our results with NBD1 of CFTR supports the notion that the NBDs of all ABC transporters are likely to share the same general fold.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	398	 If so, our findings have importance for the design of peptide models of CFTR's NBDs and imply, for instance, that CFTR NBD1 constructs truncated at or near residue 589 would be structurally incomplete and hence functionally disadvantaged (see Hartman et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	399	 1992 ; Ko and Pedersen 1995 ; Ko et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	400	 1998 ), as might CFTR NBD2 constructs truncated at Leu1399 (corresponding to NBD1 Leu602; Randak et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	401	The finding that severed CFTR channels lacking residues 415-432 (i.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	402	, coexpressed Flag3-414 plus 433-1480) are opened by MgATP with the same apparent affinity as seen for WT CFTR channels (K1/2 ~ 50  microM; Fig 11) is intriguing.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	403	 This is because a number of observations have suggested that it is binding of ATP at NBD1 (and possibly hydrolysis of that ATP) that is responsible for CFTR channel opening (reviewed in Csanady and Gadsby 1999 ; Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ).
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	404	 For example, CFTR 1-835 channels, truncated after the R domain and hence lacking NBD2, are opened by MgATP with micromolar apparent affinity (Sheppard et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	405	 1994 ), and CFTR 1-1218 channels, also lacking NBD2, yield large currents in whole oocytes and robust channel gating in excised patches (Chan et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Moreover, mutant K1250A CFTR channels, in which ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 is severely impaired (Ramjeesingh et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	407	 1999 ), show brief WT-like openings at low micromolar [ATP], but extremely long openings at higher [ATP] that reflect binding at NBD2 of ATP that cannot be hydrolyzed (Zeltwanger et al.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	408	 1999 ); those results imply that the brief openings at low [ATP] involve only NBD1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	409	 It is, nevertheless, possible that the binding site responsible for channel opening is not formed entirely by NBD1.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	410	 If the relatively high affinity action of MgATP to open CFTR channels does indeed occur at NBD1 even in Flag3-414 plus 433-1480 channels, then our findings prompt a new series of questions.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Thus, despite an overall similarity in the organization of the NBDs of all ABC transporters, perhaps the detailed structure of the nucleotide binding pocket of NBD1 in CFTR differs from that of HisP or RbsA? Or, perhaps the detailed structures are similar, but our expectations of the consequences of deleting the ss strand formed by residues 415-432 are unwarranted? Alternatively, perhaps substantial contributions to the binding energy for MgATP at NBD1 are made by other regions of the CFTR polypeptide, such as NBD2 (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	412	, Jones and George 1999 ) or cytoplasmic loops from the transmembrane domains (e.
0.43467933.10919864.html.plaintext.txt	413	 1997 )? Point mutations at residues believed to lie in or near the catalytic sites of CFTR's NBDs, chosen on the basis of the HisP and RbsA structures, should soon help resolve some of these questions (compare Vergani et al.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-activated chloride channel that resides on the apical surface of epithelial cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	5	 One unusual feature of this protein is that during biogenesis, 75% of wild type CFTR is degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradative (ERAD) pathway.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Examining the biogenesis and structural instability of the molecule has been technically challenging due to the limited amount of CFTR expressed in epithelia.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Consequently, investigators have employed heterologous overexpression systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Based on recent results that epithelial specific factors regulate both CFTR biogenesis and function, we hypothesized that CFTR biogenesis in endogenous CFTR expressing epithelial cells may be more efficient.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	9	 To test this, we compared CFTR biogenesis in two epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR (Calu-3 and T84) with two heterologous expression systems (COS-7 and HeLa).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Consistent with previous reports, 20 and 35% of the newly synthesized CFTR were converted to maturely glycosylated CFTR in COS-7 and HeLa cells, respectively.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, CFTR maturation was virtually 100% efficient in Calu-3 and T84 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome had no effect on CFTR biogenesis in Calu-3 cells, whereas it stabilized the immature form of CFTR in HeLa cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated that CFTR message levels are 4-fold lower in Calu-3 than HeLa cells, yet steady-state protein levels are comparable.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Our results question the structural instability model of wild type CFTR and indicate that epithelial cells endogenously expressing CFTR efficiently process this protein to post-Golgi compartments.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Newly synthesized proteins entering the secretory pathway are carefully monitored by the ER1 quality control machinery to ensure that only correctly folded molecules exit and continue their journey to the cell surface.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Misfolded membrane and secretory proteins are promptly recognized as such and degraded by the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD; reviewed in (1, 2).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Understanding this process is critical, since a number of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyrosis, and familial hypercholesterolemia are caused by protein folding defects that often arise from missense or deletion mutations (3, 4).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Despite the fact that many of these mutations result in the production of proteins that retain some biological activity, they are rapidly degraded by ERAD, preventing proper targeting of the proteins to their biologically relevant destinations (reviewed in Ref.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	19	Interestingly, inefficient protein biogenesis appears to occur even for "wild type" proteins, with a number of examples that include the epithelial sodium channels (6), Shaker-type potassium channels (7), major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (8), the opioid receptor (9, 10), the erythropoietin receptor (11), the erythrocyte anion exchanger 1 (Band 3) (12), and CFTR (13).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Many of these proteins, including CFTR, are assembled in the cell membrane as part of a multiprotein complex (14, 15), suggesting that the molecular rationing of the components in these complexes might be regulated during biogenesis.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	21	CFTR is a large transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two homologous halves, each containing six transmembrane segments (TMD1 and TMD2) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2), that are connected by a regulatory domain (16).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The 1480-amino acid protein is a member of the traffic ATPase or ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (17) and functions as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel (18, 19) that regulates other ion conductive pathways including epithelial Cl-, Na+, and ATP transport (20-22).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The most common mutation in CFTR, F508, results in the production of a protein that fails to exit the ER (13) and is rapidly degraded by ERAD (23-25).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Interestingly, even the wild type protein is substrate for ERAD, with as much as 75% being degraded by the proteasome during biogenesis (13, 24, 25).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Since only a small fraction of newly synthesized wild type CFTR reaches the cell surface where it performs its biological function, the question has often arisen as to why CFTR biogenesis so inefficient.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A study by Tector and Hartl (26) suggested the possibility that transmembrane segment 6 in TMD1 is unstable due to 3 charged residues within this domain.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Substitution of these residues with non-charged amino acids resulted in an increase in protein stability but a loss of chloride transport (26), suggesting that protein stability had been compromised for biological function.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	33	In the present studies, we monitored the maturation efficiency of CFTR in two human epithelial cell lines that endogenously expresses CFTR, Calu-3 (34), and T84 cells (35).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Metabolic pulse-chase analysis of CFTR in these cells grown under both nonpolarizing and polarizing conditions indicated that core glycosylated (Band B) CFTR is very efficiently (100%) processed to a maturely glycosylated (Band C) protein that is extremely stable.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Moreover, quantitative cell surface biotinylation assays revealed that the CFTR surface pool is substantially elevated in Calu-3 cells compared with heterologous expression systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Thus, endogenous CFTR maturation differs fundamentally from the patterns reported in recombinant overexpression systems, and these differences extend across multiple cellular compartments.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	153	  ERAD of CFTR Is Insignificant in Calu-3 Cells Early degradation of wild type CFTR by the proteasome has been described as a common feature of CFTR biogenesis (23, 25, 48).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Because CFTR maturation approaches 100% efficiency in Calu-3 cells, we hypothesized that the disappearance of Band B CFTR in these cells is clearly the result of maturation and not degradation by the proteasome.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	155	 To test this possibility, we compared the effects of two proteasome inhibitors (ALLN (50  microM) (48) and clasto-lactacystin--lactone (10  microM) (49)) on the half-lives of Band B CFTR in HeLa and Calu-3 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	156	 4, while 50  microM ALLN caused a significant increase in the half-life of Band B CFTR in HeLa cells, it had no effect on the stability of the immature CFTR in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that the core-glycosylated protein is not a substrate for ERAD in Calu-3 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Similar results were seen when the proteasome was blocked using 10  microM clasto-lactacystin--lactone (data not shown).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These results support our hypothesis that in Calu-3 cells all newly synthesized, core-glycosylated CFTR is processed to the fully glycosylated form, and therefore, there is no role for the proteasome in the early events of CFTR processing in Calu-3 cells.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Interestingly, these experiments in Calu-3 monolayers suggested that the amount of radiolabeled CFTR dramatically decreased compared with non-polarized conditions and that rates of conversion of newly synthesized (Band B) CFTR to fully glycosylated (Band C) CFTR was slower than under standard conditions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Only 30% of the newly synthesized (Band B) CFTR was converted into fully glycosylated (Band C) at 2 h, and maturation was completed only after 6 h of chase.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Because of low transcription and consequent low translation of CFTR in HT29 cells, only T84 cells synthesized sufficient amounts of the protein to effectively follow maturation efficiency.

0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	216	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   To our knowledge, the experiments shown here represent the first complete analysis of wild type CFTR biogenesis in human epithelial cell lines endogenously expressing the protein and highlight the following important points.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	217	 First, in contrast to heterologous CFTR-expressing cell lines, CFTR maturation is efficient in Calu-3 and T84 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Second, the mature CFTR is very stable and a large portion of it is intracellular.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Third, since CFTR biogenesis is efficient, ERAD plays no role in the degradation of the wild type protein.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	220	 And finally, although CFTR message levels are low in Calu-3 cells compared with transduced cells, the steady-state protein levels are comparable with heterologous expression systems, suggesting that CFTR biogenesis and protein stability are not faithfully reproduced in the heterologous systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These studies indicate that detailed analysis of endogenous CFTR expressing cell lines is warranted.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	222	Initial studies of CFTR biogenesis described complete and early degradation of the F508 CFTR and inefficient maturation of the wild type protein (13, 24, 52).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Most of these studies employed heterologous overexpression systems, with one exception (24).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Kopito and colleagues (24) compared wild type CFTR maturation efficiency in stable HEK cells to HT29 and T84 cells endogenously expressing wild type CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In these cells, CFTR expression levels were 10-50-fold lower than in HEK, but the maturation efficiency of CFTR was only 25% after 2 h of chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In our studies, CFTR maturation in Calu-3 and T84 cells reached the maximum (100%) only after 4 h.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Analysis of CFTR maturation efficiency in COS-7 and HeLa cells suggested that there was no significant increase in Band C levels between the 2- and 4-h chase periods, whereas in Calu-3 cells and T84 cells CFTR maturation was only completed by the end of the 4th h.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This slower CFTR processing noted in endogenously expressing cells was even more pronounced in Calu-3 cells grown as polarized monolayers.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	229	 As a comparison with other cell lines, we found that CFTR mRNA and protein levels were 4- and 10-fold higher in Calu-3 cells than in T84 and HT29 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	230	 While we were not able to follow the maturation of the protein in HT29 cells, analysis in T84 revealed that CFTR maturation was very efficient and only complete by the end of a 4-h chase.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	231	A more rapid disappearance of Band B CFTR in T84 and HT29 than in HEK cells was also described and attributed only to degradation (24).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	232	 However, those experiments were completed before the role of the proteasome in early CFTR degradation was described or before protein overexpression was shown to overload the proteasome.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that either the inhibition of the proteasome (25, 48) or protein overproduction (53) could result in delayed degradation.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Therefore, it is now clear that disappearance of Band B could be due to both degradation and maturation.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In our studies, proteasome blockade revealed that in Calu-3 cells disappearance of band B was not due to proteasomal degradation, whereas in HeLa cells it partially was.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	236	The increased half-life of the mature CFTR in Calu-3 cells suggests that epithelial factors stabilize CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	237	 This finding is supported by studies showing that CFTR half-life in heterologous systems is 8-12 h (38, 52), whereas in LLC-PK1 (54) and in MDCK cells (55), two kidney epithelial cells stably expressing the wild type CFTR, the half-life is significantly longer when the cells are grown under polarized conditions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Increased stability of the mature wild type CFTR in epithelial cells is also consistent with our previous findings that growing MDCK cells as polarized monolayers results in increased steady-state CFTR levels and function.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Furthermore, possible cell type-specific differences in wild type CFTR biogenesis and stability are suggested by our findings that cellular polarization in Calu-3 cells did not have a significant effect on total and cell surface CFTR levels in contrast to our previous findings in MDCK cells (56).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	240	Both morphological and cell surface biotinylation studies indicate the existence of a large intracellular CFTR pool in Calu-3 cells.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The dynamics and precise cellular localization of this pool remain unclear, but several studies (44, 57-61) have indicated that CFTR is found in endosomal and recycling endosomal compartments.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	242	 How regulation of surface localized CFTR is accomplished in polarized epithelia and whether there is a physiological role for the intracellular pool remain open questions.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	243	The factors that allow efficient CFTR maturation as well as those that are responsible for stabilizing the mature protein in Calu-3 and T84 cells have not been identified.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, dramatic progress has been made recently in identifying tissue-specific factors that organize the delivery and function of transport proteins to their appropriate membrane domains (27, 62-64).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	245	 These results suggest that both the cellular context and molecular rationing of transport components are important not only for proper function but also for intracellular trafficking (27, 64).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Nevertheless, normal epithelial cell function depends on the accurate delivery of a large number of membrane components to a particular cell surface domain, and defects in this process often lead to disease (3, 4).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Therefore, it is crucial to understand how different cell types organize the biogenesis and intracellular processing of key molecules (27, 28).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Since CFTR plays a central role in the regulation of epithelial ion transport in multiple organ systems, understanding its biogenesis, cellular distribution, and stability in epithelia may be the first step toward identifying the molecular defects leading to early degradation of otherwise functional mutants, such as F508 CFTR.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	249	The importance of elucidating the biogenesis and intracellular journey of wild type CFTR is also underscored by two publications indicating that some F508 CFTR can be found at the cell surface in native epithelia (65, 66).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These earlier reports raise the possibility that in the correct physiological milieu, even the mutant protein might traffic differently than reported in heterologous expression systems.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Furthermore, a number of CFTR-associating proteins have been identified and shown to regulate either the function (32) or the intracellular journey of CFTR (33).
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Whether these or other yet to be identified proteins have any effect on the biogenesis and stability of the wild type protein in native epithelia remains to be determined.
0.4319393.15066992.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Although endogenous, wild type CFTR synthesis is quite low in many native tissues, our results suggest the usefulness of cell lines endogenously expressing CFTR as powerful tools for investigating cell type-specific differences in CFTR biogenesis and function.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	6	We have previously shown that only a fraction of the newly synthesized human  opioid receptors is able to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and reach the cell surface (Petaja-Repo, U.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In the present study, we investigated the fate of those receptors that are retained intracellularly.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the disappearance of the receptor precursor form (Mr 45,000) and of two smaller species (Mr 42,000 and 39,000) is inhibited by the proteasome blocker, lactacystin.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The treatment also promoted accumulation of the mature receptor form (Mr 55,000), indicating that the ER quality control actively routes a significant proportion of rescuable receptors for proteasome degradation.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In addition, degradation intermediates that included full-length deglycosylated (Mr 39,000) and ubiquitinated forms of the receptor were found to accumulate in the cytosol upon inhibition of proteasome function.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Finally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the -subunit of the Sec61 translocon complex revealed that the receptor precursor and its deglycosylated degradation intermediates interact with the translocon.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Taken together, these results support a model in which misfolded or incompletely folded receptors are transported to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon, deglycosylated and conjugated with ubiquitin prior to degradation by the cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	14	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 quality control scrutinizes newly synthesized proteins entering the secretory pathway and ensures that only correctly folded and, in the case of multimeric proteins, fully assembled complexes are deployed to distal cellular compartments (1).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Those that fail to fulfill these criteria are retained in the ER and subsequently degraded.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Even minor changes in the protein primary structure can cause retention in the ER.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This is exemplified in many diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cases of 1-antitrypsin deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia, which are characterized by an "ER storage phenotype" (2).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although less thoroughly characterized, numerous naturally occurring mutations leading to ER retention of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have also been evoked as the cause of inherited diseases.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	19	 For example, ER-retained mutants of rhodopsin, the luteinizing hormone receptor, and the V2-vasopressin receptor have been implicated in some forms of retinitis pigmentosa, male pseudohermaphroditism, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively (3-6).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	20	Emerging evidence indicates that degradation of aberrant ER proteins is mediated by the cytosolic multiprotease complex, the 26 S proteasome.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Indeed, an increasing number of misfolded or unassembled yeast and eukaryotic integral membrane and secreted proteins have been shown to be substrates for this disposal mechanism (7-26).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, proteasome-mediated degradation is not restricted to misfolded or unassembled proteins, as evidenced by the observation that some resident ER proteins are substrates for this degradation pathway in response to cellular signals (27-29).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It can thus be hypothesized that this degradation pathway might have a role in regulating steady state levels of normal wild type proteins traversing the secretory pathway, as has been described for many cytosolic and nuclear regulatory molecules (for review, see Refs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Reported examples pointing to this phenomenon are, however, scarce, exceptions being apolipoprotein B100 (32, 33), apolipoprotein(a) (34), and tyrosinase (35).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In a recent report, Schubert and co-workers (36) showed that at least 30% of newly synthesized proteins might be degraded by the proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Whether these degraded proteins represent defective ribosomal products resulting from errors in translation, as suggested, or might also include correctly translated but incompletely folded proteins remains to be determined.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	27	Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins is a well described phenomenon (for review, see Refs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	28	 30 and 31), but the detailed mechanisms involved in the ER-associated proteasomal degradation remain unclear.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recent findings have led to the emergence of models suggesting that misfolded or incompletely folded ER proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane through the Sec61 translocon complex and conjugated with ubiquitin before hydrolysis by the 26 S proteasomes (for review, see Refs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	30	We have previously shown that the human  opioid receptor (hOR) is an example of integral membrane proteins that are partially retained in the ER, possibly due to difficulties in the folding process (40).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Another example is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (for review, see Ref.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Only about 40% and 25% of the newly synthesized wild type hOR and CFTR molecules, respectively, are able to leave the ER and reach the cell surface.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We thus set out to determine whether the ER-retained hORs are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasomes and, if so, to delineate the mechanisms involved in this process.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The results presented here indicate that these receptors are transported back to the cytosol, in a process that involves the Sec61 translocon, and deglycosylated before being degraded by the proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasomal pathway led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated receptor forms, pointing to the fact that polyubiquitination may be a targeting signal for disposal of misfolded or incompletely folded hOR molecules.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	98	Degradation of ER-retained Newly Synthesized hORs Is Mediated by the Proteasomal Pathway-- We have previously shown that a large fraction of newly synthesized hORs in HEK-293S cells remains in a pre-Golgi compartment as core-glycosylated Mr 45,000 precursors that are not transported to the cell surface (40).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Now we set out to investigate the fate of these intracellularly retained receptors.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	100	 To determine whether proteasomes are involved in the degradation of these receptor forms, cells were incubated with lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome (44, 45).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	101	 HEK-293S cells stably expressing the receptor carrying a C-terminal FLAG epitope (HEK-293S-hOR-FLAG cells) were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and after a chase in a medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine, cell lysates were prepared and the receptors isolated by immunoprecipitation (Fig.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	102	 A major band of Mr 45,000 and two minor ones of Mr 42,000 and 39,000 were apparent in untreated cells at the end of the pulse (Fig.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	103	 During the subsequent chase, label incorporated into these bands decreased and a slower, more diffusely migrating band of Mr 55,000 appeared, representing the fully mature receptor (40).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	104	 When the cells were treated with lactacystin, an increase in labeling of all receptor species was detected (Fig.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Furthermore, proteasome inhibition significantly retarded the disappearance of the Mr 45,000, 42,000, and 39,000 receptor species, the half-life of the last one being the most dramatically affected (Table I).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Similar findings were obtained using two other proteasome inhibitors, the peptide aldehydes MG-132 and PSI (45) (data not shown).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Taken together, these results suggest an active role of proteasomes in the elimination of newly synthesized hORs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The fact that lactacystin promoted increase in receptor labeling, even within a shorter pulse period of 15 min, suggests that targeting to degradation begins very early, either cotranslationally or immediately after the receptor synthesis is complete.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Inhibition of this rapid degradation is most likely responsible for the increase in the amount of mature receptors observed in pulse-chase labeling experiments (compare lanes 4 and 5 in Fig.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Our findings are not due to the presence of a FLAG-epitope tag at the C terminus of the receptor since the same results were also obtained using a receptor harboring the tag at its N terminus (data not shown).

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We therefore assessed whether the smaller molecular weight receptor species of Mr 42,000 and 39,000 represent deglycosylated receptors rather than proteolytic fragments.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	128	 For this purpose, immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse-labeled samples were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation using PNGase F to remove the two N-linked glycans from the receptor (40).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	129	 2 (lane 5), complete deglycosylation of the Mr 45,000 receptor precursor led to the appearance of a single species migrating at Mr 39,000.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The fact that the Mr 42,000 species was found to be an intermediate in the stepwise deglycosylation of the receptor precursor suggests that this species represents a receptor carrying one N-linked glycan.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The mobility of the Mr 39,000 species that was stabilized in lactacystin-treated cells was indistinguishable from that of the PNGase F-digested core-glycosylated Mr 45,000 receptor form (Fig.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Receptors were immunoprecipitated from four fractions: 1000  x  g pellet containing cellular debris, nuclei and trapped soluble proteins, 10,000  x  g pellet containing crude membranes, 100,000  x  g pellet containing residual microsomal membranes, and 100,000  x  g supernatant containing cytosolic proteins.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	163	The fact that inhibition of proteasomal degradation significantly increased the amount of the Mr 39,000 hOR species in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	164	 3A, lanes 7 and 8), suggests that this species may dislocate from the ER membrane and accumulate in the cytosol prior to proteasomal degradation.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	165	 To test this hypothesis, receptors were immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction after pulse-chase labeling of lactacystin-treated cells.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	166	 3E, a small amount of the Mr 39,000 receptor species was present in the cytosol at the end of the pulse.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, the amount detected clearly increased during the chase, indicating that the Mr 39,000 species originates from a pool of newly synthesized receptors that are retained in the ER and not from a failure or inefficiency of the translocation machinery.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Thus, this species most likely results from deglycosylation of the Mr 45,000 receptor precursor that is destined for degradation and eventually dislocates from the ER membrane.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Although hardly any ubiquitinated material could be seen in the membrane fraction (lane 2), longer exposure revealed that some ubiquitinated receptors were also associated with this fraction (lane 7).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These results suggest that ubiquitinated receptors accumulate in the cytosol after the receptor dislocates from the ER membrane but that addition of ubiquitin molecules to the receptor begins prior to dislocation.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	192	 To further verify that the receptor itself was being ubiquitinated and did not coimmunoprecipitate with other ubiquitinated proteins, the anti-ubiquitin antibody immunoprecipitates were purified a second time with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody following SDS denaturation.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Polyubiquitination of the receptor did not result from the presence of a FLAG-epitope tag at its C terminus since a N-terminally tagged receptor form was also found to be ubiquitinated (data not shown).

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Such nonubiquitinated species probably results from constant deubiquitination by ubiquitin isopeptidases (50).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	200	 It is very unlikely that this form could result from a lactacystin-mediated interference in cotranslational protein translocation into the ER membrane since this species accumulates in the cytosol during the chase period of the metabolic labeling experiment shown in Fig.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This interaction was shown to be specific because these species were absent when the anti-Sec61 antibody was replaced with a preimmune serum in the first immunoprecipitation step (Fig.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Because the cells were chased for 60 min before the lysates were prepared, the receptor species that interact with the translocon are more likely to be in transit to exit the ER rather than being translocated into the membrane.

0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	217	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	218	The results of the present study indicate that core-glycosylated hOR precursors that are not competent to enter the maturation pathway are transported to the cytosol in a process that involves the Sec61 translocon, removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, and addition of ubiquitin molecules.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This process leads to targeting of a significant proportion of newly synthesized receptors for degradation by the 26 S proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The hOR thus appears to be a protein that, due to inherent difficulties in acquiring its native conformation, is very efficiently disposed of by the ER quality control.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	221	 This elimination could result either from a high level of irreversible misfolding or from limitations in the folding kinetics.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Because proteasomal blockade was found to enhance ER export and maturation of the receptor, kinetic limitations leading to the premature degradation of folding intermediates most likely contribute to the observed phenomenon.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Irrespective of the nature of the receptor forms that are targeted for degradation (irreversibly misfolded or folding intermediates), the present results show that the ER quality control can eliminate a high proportion of wild type proteins.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	224	 This does not seem to be unique to the hOR since Schubert and colleagues (36) recently suggested that at least 30% of newly synthesized proteins are degraded by the proteasomes (36).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	225	 It was hypothesized that degradation of what was referred to as defective ribosomal products could serve as an important adaptation for early antigen presentation during viral infection (36, 51).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Whether the high rate of degradation of the newly synthesized hORs also serves a biological purpose remains to be determined.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Alternatively, this process could merely reflect the exceedingly stringent control system monitoring the rapid but error-prone protein synthesis machinery.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Because expression to a relatively high level (~10 pmol/mg of protein for the clone used) is needed to perform the type of studies presented here, one cannot entirely exclude that overexpression is in part responsible for the proteasomal-mediated degradation observed.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, we feel that this is unlikely since identical data were obtained using a clone expressing a smaller number of receptors (4 pmol/mg of protein; data not shown).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Additionally, the fact that several endogenously expressed ER proteins have been shown to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in a regulated manner (27-29) reinforces the idea that this proteolytic pathway is a general mechanism used to regulate protein biosynthesis.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	231	Several lines of evidence demonstrate the role of cytoplasmic proteasomes in the high degradation rate of newly synthesized hORs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	232	 First, the turnover rate of the core-glycosylated Mr 45,000 precursor as well as that of the two smaller receptor species of Mr 42,000 and 39,000 was reduced considerably in cells treated with proteasomal inhibitors, lactacystin, MG-132, and PSI.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Second, the amount of the fully mature receptor was increased upon proteasomal inhibition.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Finally, the Mr 39,000 receptor and its polyubiquitinated forms accumulated in the cytoplasm following proteasomal blockade.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Given that the Mr 39,000 receptor species contains the full-length receptor polypeptide, these data support the hypothesis that integral membrane proteins are released completely from the ER membrane prior to proteasomal degradation rather than cleaved partially within the membrane (13-15, 17, 42).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	236	Association of the hOR precursor and that of the two full-length deglycosylated intermediates with the Sec61 translocon supports the recently proposed model, suggesting that retrotranslocation of misfolded or incompletely folded ER proteins to the cytoplasm is mediated by the Sec61 complex (13, 17, 21, 46, 52, 53), the multimeric protein complex that is also responsible for the cotranslational translocation of proteins into the ER (54).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Like the hOR, the major histocompatibility class I molecule and the F508 mutant of the CFTR were found to interact with the Sec61 translocon during their transit out of the ER, which leads to their degradation by the proteasomes (13, 17).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	238	 It can be hypothesized that dislocation of these integral membrane proteins may involve a reverse process of membrane integration involving lateral opening of the translocon toward the lipid bilayer (39, 54).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	239	 However, how these misfolded or incompletely folded proteins are recognized and delivered to the dislocation machinery is unknown.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Similarly, the precise mechanism by which these proteasomal substrates are extracted from the lipid bilayer as well as the origin of the driving force for their retrotranslocation are still unresolved issues.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	241	The finding that the Mr 39,000 hOR degradation intermediate accumulates in the cytosol following lactacystin treatment suggests that proteasomal function is not obligatory for dislocation of membrane proteins from the ER membrane.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	242	 However, this does not rule out the possibility that, in normal conditions (i.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	243	 when proteasomes are not impaired), dislocation and degradation of misfolded or incompletely folded proteins may be tightly coupled events.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In fact, three observations in the present study suggest coupling between proteasome function and dislocation of proteins from the ER membrane.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Inhibition of the proteasome was found to: 1) increase the amount and reduce the turnover-rate of the membrane bound Mr 42,000 and 45,000 forms of the receptor, 2) increase the total amount of receptor coimmunoprecipitated with the -subunit of the Sec61 complex, and 3) increase the relative proportion of the translocon-associated Mr 39,000 degradation intermediate that ultimately dislocates from the ER membrane into the cytosol.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Thus, although proteasomal function is not obligatory for dislocation, its impairment appears to lead to attenuation of the process and prolongation of association with the translocon.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	247	 These results are consistent with findings showing that mutant (21) and chimeric (55) transmembrane proteins were stabilized within the ER membrane of yeast mutants expressing functionally impaired proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Coupling of dislocation and degradation could be achieved by direct transfer of protein substrates to the proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Indeed, although proteasomes are mainly detected in the cytosol and the nucleus, some have been found to be associated with ER membranes (56).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Coupling of membrane dissociation and proteolysis would clearly increase the efficiency of proteolysis, because direct transfer of the unfolded retrotranslocated proteins to the proteasome would eliminate the need for additional unfolding of the substrate that is a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation (31).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	251	 At the same time, the proteasome itself, via its regulatory subcomplex, PA700, could provide the driving force for the retrotranslocation (31).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Such coupling would also be a very effective way to prevent cytoplasmic aggregation of dislocated membrane proteins.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In this context, it is noteworthy that proteasomal blockade has been shown to promote the formation of high molecular weight insoluble aggregates (8, 16).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	254	 For example, both wild type and F508 mutant forms of the CFTR were shown to accumulate, together with cytosolic chaperones, in a specific pericentriolar structure, called the aggresome (57, 58).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	255	Inhibition of proteasomal degradation resulted in accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of the hOR in the cytosol, suggesting that this modification may target the misfolded or incompletely folded receptors to the proteasome.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Based on the finding that a small amount of ubiquitinated receptor forms was detected in the membrane fraction, it can also be envisioned that polyubiquitination could provide a direct signal for proteasome recruitment to the ER membrane.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	257	 However, it is unclear whether ubiquitination is a prerequisite for the rapid breakdown of the receptor, as has been shown for many other integral membrane and secretory proteins that are degraded by the proteasomes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	258	 For example, many misfolded or unassembled ER proteins were shown to be stabilized by mutant ubiquitin-activating (8, 46, 48) or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (9, 10, 18, 20, 21, 59) or by dominant-negative ubiquitin mutants that prevent polyubiquitination of substrate proteins (8-10, 18, 21, 48, 60).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	259	 When considering the enzymes that could be responsible for the ubiquitination of the hOR while it is still membrane-bound, it is noteworthy that two yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, the Ubc6p and the Ubc7p, have been implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of ER proteins (9, 10, 18, 20, 21, 28, 59).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Both of these enzymes are localized to the ER, thus possibly enabling ubiquitination of misfolded or incompletely folded proteins prior to their dislocation from the membrane.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The Ubc6p is an integral membrane protein, which is anchored to the membrane via a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence (61), whereas the Ubc7p is docked onto the membrane protein Cue1p (59).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In a recent report, several mammalian homologs of the Ubc6p were identified (62).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Whether these enzymes are actually involved in ubiquitination and degradation of ER proteins remains to be determined.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	264	Proteasomal degradation of the hOR is preceded by removal of the two N-linked oligosaccharides from the Mr 45,000 receptor precursor.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This is in agreement with previous reports on glycoproteins for which proteasomal degradation has been described (13-17, 26, 35, 42, 46).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Although PNGase-type activity has been detected in both cytosolic and microsomal membrane fractions of mammalian tissues (63, 64), the enzymes mediating the deglycosylation of misfolded or incompletely folded proteins as well as their precise location have remained elusive.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	267	 However, recent cloning of a cytosolic yeast PNGase (65) may be pointing to the first candidate involved in deglycosylation of proteasomal substrates.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	268	 In any case, our data suggest that deglycosylation of the hOR occurs prior to dislocation from the ER membrane and the translocon.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Indeed, neither the Mr 45,000 receptor precursor nor the partially deglycosylated Mr 42,000 form were found in the cytosolic fraction.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Furthermore, the fully deglycosylated Mr 39,000 degradation intermediate was found to coimmunoprecipitate with the -subunit of the Sec61 complex.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	271	Whether the degradation pathway uncovered for the hOR in the present study is a unique characteristic of this receptor or represents a general mechanism regulating the maturation and cell surface expression of most GPCRs remains an open question.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Indeed, very little is known about the processes involved in the folding/maturation/degradation of other GPCRs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Inhibition of proteasome function was found to lead to an increase in the 2-adrenergic receptor expression in HEK-293 cells (66) and only three GPCRs, rhodopsin (67) and the yeast - and a-mating factor receptors (68, 69), have previously been shown to be ubiquitinated.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	274	 For rhodopsin, no specific role has yet been attributed to the modification whereas ubiquitination has been proposed to be an internalization signal for the activated -mating factor receptor, leading to its lysosomal/vacuolar degradation (68, 70-72).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Interestingly, monoubiquitination rather than polyubiquitination normally associated with the proteasome degradation pathway appears to be sufficient to promote such internalization (70, 72).
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	276	 It will be interesting to determine whether ubiquitination of the hOR and other mammalian GPCRs can, in addition to its role in the proteasome-mediated degradation of ER-retained receptors, also be implicated in their internalization and lysosomal degradation.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Such a dual role for ubiquitination has been proposed for a number of yeast and mammalian membrane proteins (38) but has not been documented yet for mammalian GPCRs.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	278	Results of the present study support the notion that the cytosolic proteasomal disposal mechanism is involved in the elimination of newly synthesized hORs, resulting ultimately in degradation of even salvageable folding intermediates.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This raises several important questions.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	280	 For example, it becomes important to determine the mechanisms by which the stringent ER monitoring system discriminates conformational variants of the receptor and sorts them either for degradation or allows their transport downstream within the secretory pathway.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Future studies are also needed to identify the pathways and components that facilitate folding of the receptor and to determine whether these are under the control of dynamic regulatory processes.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Although inhibiting proteasomal function favored ER export and maturation of the receptor, a large proportion of the newly synthesized receptors still remained entrapped within the ER.
0.44344512.11054417.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Whether approaches acting at earlier off-pathway steps could be more effective in enhancing receptor folding still remains to be investigated.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We have previously identified the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)-interacting protein CAL and demonstrated that CAL modulates CFTR plasma membrane expression by retaining CFTR within the cell.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Here, we report that in addition to regulating membrane expression, CAL also regulates the expression of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The co-expression of hemagglutinin-tagged or Myc-tagged CAL with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR in COS-7 cells causes a dose-dependent reduction in mature GFP-CFTR, independent of its tags.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Bafilomycin A1, a lysosomal proton pump inhibitor, increases mature GFP-CFTR, confirming previous reports of lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Importantly, bafilomycin A1 reverses CAL-mediated CFTR degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, on the other hand, does not reverse the effect of CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	9	 CAL has no effect on CFTR maturation, suggesting that it exerts its effects on mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Co-expression of CAL enhances the degradation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We showed previously that CAL reduces the half-life of CFTR at the cell surface.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Here we show that expression of dominant-negative dynamin 2 K44A, a large GTPase inhibitor that is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and vesicle formation in the Golgi, increases cell surface CFTR as measured by surface biotinylation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More importantly, dynamin 2 K44A also restores cell surface CFTR in CAL-overexpressing cells and partially blocks the CAL-mediated degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These data suggest a model in which CAL retains CFTR in the cell and targets CFTR for degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Cystic fibrosis is a common lethal genetic disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)1 (1, 2).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The best-known and probably the primary defect in cystic fibrosis is salt and water transport in plasma membranes of epithelial cells lining the organs of lung, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat duct, and reproductive systems (3).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CFTR is a membrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transport family.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It functions as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase- and ATP-regulated Cl to  channel (4), as well as a regulatory protein for the epithelial sodium channel (5) and other channels (6), and as a putative receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These well characterized functions of CFTR require its correct synthesis, maturation, and trafficking from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to the cell surface.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	20	Misfolded proteins are recognized by ER quality control system and are targeted for degradation in ER-associated degradation (8).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Immature, wild type CFTR is folded inefficiently in the ER with a large fraction degraded before reaching the plasma membrane (9).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	22	 That which is folded efficiently traffics to the Golgi and acquires complex glycosylation characteristic of the mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The most common mutation in CF, F508CFTR, is a misfolded protein and is recognized as such by the ER, translocated to the cytosol, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (9).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus, the predominant majority of the F508 never matures and traffics to the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	25	The degradation of mature CFTR is less well understood.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (10) found that both the lysosome and proteasome are involved.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	27	 They found that lysosomal inhibitors increase the half-life of mature wild type CFTR in baby hamster kidney cells transfected with CFTR and in the endogenous CFTR in Caco-2 and T84 cells.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Interestingly, C-terminal truncation mutants do not traffic to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Instead, they are degraded in the proteasome (10).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, CFTR appears to enter different degradative pathways depending on signals within its C terminus.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	31	CFTR possesses a type I, C-terminal, PDZ (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1)-binding motif.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Several PDZ domain proteins known to interact with CFTR include NHE-RF/EBP-50, CAP70, and CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) (11 to 15).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The C-terminal tail of CFTR plays a potential regulatory role in modulating its Cl to  channel activity.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Adding recombinant NHE-RF or CAP70 fusion proteins to the cytoplasmic side of CFTR in vitro increases the activity of CFTR (15, 16).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition, NHE-RF anchors CFTR to cytoskeleton stabilizing the cell surface CFTR (13, 17).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both NHE-RF and its related protein, E3KARP, link cAMP-dependent protein kinase to CFTR (13, 18).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Moreover, NHE-RF was shown to link 2-adrenergic receptor to CFTR (19).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Formation of such macromolecular complexes facilitates the efficiency of activation CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	39	CAL (also known as PIST (PDZ domain protein interacting specifically with TC10), GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing), and FIG (fused in glioblastoma)) (11, 20 to 22) is a CFTR-interacting PDZ domain protein that associates predominantly with the Golgi apparatus.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells by decreasing the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This effect of CAL can be overcome by NHE-RF, which restores the plasma membrane expression of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	42	 CAL favors the retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Interestingly, overexpression of CAL also reduces the amount of CFTR (23).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	44	 These findings point to a role for CAL in the intracellular trafficking of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Consistent with this notion, CAL interacts with proteins involved in membrane vesicle trafficking such as the SNARE protein, syntaxin 6, and the small GTPase, TC10 (20, 22).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Furthermore, CAL also interacts with and potentially regulates the intracellular trafficking of the Wnt receptors, frizzled 5 and 8, neural members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, CALEB/NGC (21, 24), and the chloride channel, CLC-3B (23).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	47	Recently, PDZ domain interactions were found to be involved in trafficking of other plasma membrane proteins both to and from the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	48	 For example, synapse-associated protein 102 is involved in the delivery of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors to the cell surface (25).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In addition, NHE-RF regulates 2-adrenergic receptor recycling to plasma membrane (26).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	50	In addition to the PDZ domain, the C-tail of CFTR contains motifs for endocytosis.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	51	 A tyrosine motif at the C terminus of CFTR binds directly with the  micro light chain of the AP2 complex involved in sorting CFTR for endocytosis into clathrin-coated pits (27).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Surface CFTR is endocytosed rapidly.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	53	 For example, within 5 min, 50% CFTR at the plasma membrane is endocytosed via AP2 clathrin-coated pits.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	54	 CFTR contained within endosomes can be either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded in the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Because surface CFTR has a long half-life (24 to 48h), the majority of CFTR must be recycled back to the cell surface instead of targeted to the lysosome for degradation.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Note that expression of either type of tagged CAL construct significantly reduced steady state levels of the mature band of CFTR assayed at 48 h post-transfection.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Consistent with previous results (23), the effects of CAL on mature CFTR were dose-dependent and independent of the epitope tags.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Both results argue that CAL down-regulates CFTR mature protein in a specific fashion.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Our data combined with previous findings obtained with other lysosome blocking agents (10, 11) suggest that lysosomal degradation is an important process in regulating mature CFTR abundance.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The reversal of CAL-mediated reduction of mature CFTR by bafilomycin A1 is also reproduced in the stable cell line 4F2 (Fig.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	159	 These results strongly suggested that CAL plays a key role in regulating the bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	160	 On the other hand, treating CAL-transfected cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not rescue mature GFP-CFTR (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	161	 2A) back to the control levels observed in the absence of CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In contrast to bafilomycin A1 treatment, in the presence of CAL, MG132 actually reduced levels of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It has been observed by several investigators that proteasome inhibition does not increase the maturation of CFTR (31, 32).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	164	 MG132 did not increase immature CFTR in the Nonidet P-40 lysates probably because blocking of proteosomal degradation leads to the accumulation of CFTR into a detergent-insoluble polyubiquitinated form of immature CFTR (32).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The failure of MG132 to inhibit CAL reduction of mature CFTR is further evidence that CAL can function downstream of the proteosome and influence the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	166	What Is the Effect of CAL on CFTR Maturation? The steady state level of mature CFTR is determined by new protein synthesis and the trafficking and maturation of CFTR from ER to Golgi as well as post-Golgi degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	167	 To eliminate the possibility that, in addition to enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR in the lysosome, CAL decreases CFTR synthesis and/or maturation, we examined the synthesis and maturation of CFTR by metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	168	 3A, COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR with or without HA-CAL were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 30 min at 16 h post-transfection.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The cells were then chased in medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine for 1 to 4 h to follow the maturation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	170	 3A, band B) is the newly synthesized CFTR in ER that appears first.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Not all newly synthesized CFTR is converted to mature CFTR (band C, upper band); because CFTR folds inefficiently, most of band B is degraded by ER-associated degradation (8).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	172	 3 shows that GFP-CFTR matures similarly whether transfected or not transfected with CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, CAL exerts its effects on mature CFTR and does not affect the synthesis and trafficking to Golgi.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	174	 To test this hypothesis directly, the effect of CAL on mature CFTR was examined.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	175	 GFP-CFTR becomes fully mature after chasing for 4 h (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	176	 There is no significant difference in the amount of CFTR in CAL transfected and untransfected cells (40,990  plus or minus  1840 versus 39,284  plus or minus  1464 arbitrary unit/dish, p  >  0.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The mature CFTR was then followed when cells were chased for an additional 16 h.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	178	 3C, there was less 35S-labeled mature CFTR after 16 h in cells transfected with HA-CAL than with those not transfected with HA-CAL, confirming the role of CAL in the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	179	 On the other hand, if bafilomycin A1 was added at 4 h in the absence of CAL, followed by a 16-h chase, more labeled CFTR remains after 16 h compared with that remaining in the absence of both CAL and bafilomycin A1, suggesting that degradation was inhibited.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Of note is that there is more labeled CFTR remaining in CAL-transfected cells in the presence of bafilomycin than in CAL-transfected cells in the absence of bafilomycin.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Importantly, the fraction of mature CFTR sensitive to bafilomycin A1 is statistically larger in the presence of CAL versus the control (50.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	182	01), indicating that CAL is enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Taken together, these data suggest that CAL does not affect early CFTR biosynthesis in the ER or maturation to mature CFTR.

0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We previously identified CAL as a novel CFTR-interacting protein and showed that co-expression of CAL retains CFTR in the intracellular compartment decreasing cell surface expression of CFTR (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Here, we show that CAL causes a dose-dependent reduction in the total amount of mature CFTR (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The proton pump inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, reverses CAL-mediated reduction in mature CFTR (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Transfection of CAL leads to an increase in the extent of bafilomycin A1-sensitive degradation of CFTR (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, on the other hand, does not reverse the effect of CAL (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Pulse-chase experiments indicate that CAL has no effect on CFTR maturation, suggesting that it exerts its effect on mature CFTR (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	262	 3) by enhancing the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	263	 As we have previously shown, CAL reduces the half-life of CFTR at the cell surface (11).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Co-expression of a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin 2, Dyn2K44A-GFP, with CAL and CFTR restores cell surface CFTR and partially blocks the CAL-mediated degradation of mature CFTR (Figs.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	265	 These data suggest a model in which CAL retains CFTR in the cell and targets mature CFTR for degradation via mechanisms involving post-Golgi vesicle formation and trafficking.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	266	Both intracellular retention and degradation of mature CFTR by CAL contributes to the CAL-mediated down-regulation of CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	267	 To date, no enzymatic activity has been identified in CAL.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Examining the protein domains and motifs suggests that CAL is a scaffolding protein with multiple protein-binding domains.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Like other scaffolding proteins, CAL operates as an adaptor to couple multiple proteins.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Other than the PDZ domain that binds to CFTR, the second coiled-coil domain binds to the small GTPase TC10 and the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 (20, 22).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Both TC10 and syntaxin 6 are known to be involved in intracellular trafficking.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	272	 TC10 is a member of the Rho-GTPase family.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In adipose tissues, TC10 is involved in regulating the trafficking of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	274	 As an adaptor protein, CAL is likely to link CFTR to the intracellular trafficking processes carried out by TC10 or syntaxin 6 in CFTR-expressing epithelial tissues.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	275	At steady state, CAL is localized to the Golgi complex, particularly in the TGN and cytosol.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	276	 TC10 is localized at the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles; syntaxin 6 is primarily in Golgi and endosomes.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	277	 CFTR spans all of these compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	278	 For these proteins to work in concert on CFTR, they must physically interact.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	279	 One possibility is that they interact at the interface of their respective compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Alternatively, one or all of these proteins could cycle among different compartments.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	281	 For example, CAL may traffic from TGN/Golgi to the plasma membrane and then to endosomes and to the lysosome, or it may traffic directly from the TGN to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	282	 6 depicts evidence supporting this notion.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The data show that expression of a dominant-negative dynamin 2 mutant redistributes CAL to the cell periphery into punctuate structures that co-localize with the mutant dynamin 2.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In this circumstance CAL is arrested at the sites where dynamin regulates vesicle budding (Fig.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A is well known to inhibit endocytosis and to affect the Golgi (33, 35).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The observation that the dynamin 2 mutant Dyn2K44A enhances surface expression of mature CFTR and does not have a large effect on the total amount of mature CFTR supports the notion that the primary effect of Dyn2K44A is post-Golgi.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus, it is likely that CAL can traffic with CFTR past the Golgi and target CFTR for degradation either through endocytosis at the plasma membrane or via direct trafficking from a post-Golgi compartment to the lysosome.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, it is important to note that our data do not exclude other ways of regulating mature protein and cell surface expression CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	289	The evidence that CAL is involved in trafficking in tissues other than epithelia was suggested by two recent papers.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Neuronal CAL contributes to the pathology of Lurcher mice (39).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Lurcher mutant mice are ataxic because of degeneration of the cortex of the cerebella.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Constitutive activation of the GluRd2Lc receptor causes an inward current and the death of Purkinje cells.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Neuronal CAL has an additional 8 amino acids at the beginning of the second coiled-coil domain.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	294	 CAL binds to GluRd2 and Beclin1 and links receptor activation to autophagy and cell death (39).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Autophagy involves trafficking membrane compartments to the lysosome for degradation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Therefore, CAL maybe involved in lysosomal trafficking in autophagy.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	297	More information on the function of CAL came from knockout mouse experiments (40).
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In CAL knockout mice, the males are infertile.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The mature sperm of male mice missing CAL lack acrosome, a specialized lysosomal structure derived from the Golgi that is required for oocyte activation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In normal mice, CAL is located in the TGN and TGN-derived vesicles of the round spermatids.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	301	 These data suggest that CAL is involved in acrosome biogenesis, perhaps by facilitating protein cargo transport to this organelle.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	302	New therapies are under development to promote F508 CFTR maturation.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Interfering with the degradation of F508 CFTR in the post-Golgi compartments may be an attractive method to boost levels of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Our current study suggests a method to accomplish this by inhibiting the degradation of mature CFTR.
0.5272462.14570915.html.plaintext.txt	305	 More importantly, a more specific way of blocking the interaction between CAL and CFTR may potentially allow more CFTR to be trafficked to the plasma membrane.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	14	CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is an epithelial anion channel that requires cAMP-dependent phosphorylation plus intracellular ATP to open (19, 46, 50).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These channels are normally expressed in the apical membranes of epithelial cells lining the airways, intestines, pancreatic ducts, and kidney tubules (19, 46, 33, 56).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mutations in the gene coding for CFTR impair epithelial Cl and HCO3 transport and cause cystic fibrosis (CF).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Most CF patients ( > 90%) have an allele coding for a mutant CFTR that lacks phenylalanine at the 508 position (19, 46).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	18	 F508 CFTR retains function as a protein kinase A- and ATP-regulated anion channel (9) but is absent from the plasma membranes of most cells used for heterologous expression (6, 14).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Hence, many CF patients are expected to benefit from increased F508-CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	20	 (34, 35) identified an important caveat regarding heterologous expression of CFTR.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Specifically, they showed that wild-type CFTR was not present in the plasma membranes of HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells unless the cells were confluent and polarized.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Furthermore, the change in CFTR localization to the cell surface was not mediated by a change in transcription or translation, since polarized and nonpolarized HT-29 cells contained similar amounts of CFTR mRNA and protein (34, 35).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These data suggest that the trafficking of CFTR to the apical cell surface is highly regulated.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There are also a number of reports showing that detectable amounts of endogenous CFTR protein is present at the apical membranes of epithelial cells from F508-homozygous CF patients (14, 15, 28, 44, 49, 62).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus it is likely that additional factors regulate endogenous CFTR maturation and cell surface localization in epithelial cells.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The aims of this study were to test this hypothesis and to gain some insight regarding how endogenous CFTR expression may be increased.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	27	Growing primary or immortalized airway epithelial cells on filters with nearly all of the apical fluid removed has been shown to cause a six- to eightfold increase in CFTR-mediated anion secretion compared with conventional (submerged) controls (30, 52).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This maneuver has been referred to as air-liquid interface culture (27, 31, 36, 41, 43) or air interface culture (30, 52).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The mediator responsible for the increased Cl or HCO3 secretory response following air-liquid interface culture and its possible effects on CFTR remains unknown.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Since most conventional cell cultures are hypoxic (8, 12, 40, 59), we hypothesized that improved cellular oxygenation may enhance CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	31	We used a subclone of the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line as a model to test this hypothesis.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	32	 MDCK cells from American Type Culture Collection (23) consist of at least two strains or types (38, 45).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Type I MDCK cells form high-resistance monolayers that demonstrate small Cl secretory currents following addition of cAMP-mediated agonists, whereas type II MDCK cells form low-resistance monolayers and do not respond to cAMP (5, 32, 45, 51).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recent studies indicate that type I clones endogenously express small amounts of CFTR under conventional culture conditions (32).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Thus subclones of type I MDCK cells may provide a good model to test for possible enhancement of CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	36	In the present study, we show that culturing type I MDCK cells with an air-liquid interface caused a 50-fold increase in forskolin-stimulated Cl secretion over a period of 4-5 days in culture.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	37	 On the basis of this observation, we then tested the notion that the increased Cl secretory response was mediated by enhanced CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Finally, we exposed submerged or air-liquid interface cultures to varying amounts of O2 to determine whether the effects of air-liquid interface culture were mediated by improved oxygenation.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The data presented here show that increasing oxygen from hypoxic to atmospheric levels markedly enhanced CFTR maturation and apical membrane localization.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Our observations have important implications since cultured cells (39, 47, 53, 59) and CF patients (18, 24, 57) are often hypoxic.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Figure 1 compares representative Isc records from MDCK-AA7 monolayers grown either with the apical side submerged by culture medium (solid line) or with an apical air-liquid interface for 4 days (dashed line).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Forskolin (10  microM) was added to both sides to increase cellular cAMP (43).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The forskolin-stimulated currents were inhibited by basolateral addition of either barium (5 mM, see Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	116	 1), bumetanide (10  microM, not shown), or ouabain (100  microM, not shown).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The effects of forskolin, barium, bumetanide, and ouabain indicate that the forskolin-stimulated Isc provides a direct measure of electrogenic Cl secretion (1, 5, 10, 45, 51, 52, 60).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These results also agree with those of previous studies of type I MDCK cells (5, 45, 51).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Electrogenic Na+ absorption did not contribute to Isc, since apical amiloride (100  microM) had no effect on Isc when added before (Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	120	 1) or after forskolin (not shown).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Both filters that produced the records shown in Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	122	 1 were seeded with ~5  x  104 cells/cm2, and both were cultured under standard conditions for 1 wk.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	123	 One monolayer was then exposed to an air-liquid interface for 4 days by having most of the apical fluid removed and not replaced, while the other monolayer remained submerged under  > 2.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus the imposition of an apical air-liquid interface for 4 days markedly enhanced forskolin-stimulated Cl secretion.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Amiloride (100  microM) was used to abolish possible Isc due to active Na+ absorption (3).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Forskolin (10  microM) was then added to both sides to increase cellular cAMP and stimulate electrogenic Cl secretion (52).

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Amiloride, forskolin, and BaCl2 were present continuously in the bathing solutions following addition.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	150	 One possible explanation for the results shown in the previous section is that growth with an air-liquid interface increased the number of CFTR Cl channels in the apical membranes.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	151	 As an initial test of this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation was used to determine whether air-liquid interface culture had any effect on the amount and/or biochemical properties of CFTR.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Figure 3 compares the immunoprecipitated CFTR derived from conventional, fluid-immersed monolayers (fluid) with the CFTR obtained from air-interface monolayers (air).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	153	 CFTR immunoprecipitated from filter-grown T84 cells served as a control (1, 10).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Submerged MDCK-AA7 monolayers expressed only a small amount of CFTR.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Furthermore, much of the protein from submerged monolayers had an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a 140-kDa molecular weight protein.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In contrast, the MDCK-AA7 monolayers grown with an air-liquid interface for 5 days showed an increase in total CFTR protein level as well as a shift toward a higher molecular weight (~170 kDa).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Previous studies indicate that a 140-kDa band B form of CFTR represents an immature, core-glycosylated protein, whereas a 170-kDa band C form is fully glycosylated (6, 14).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus the increase in the total amount of CFTR protein and the increase in molecular weight following air-liquid interface culture suggest that the 50-fold increase in forskolin-stimulated Isc is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced maturation.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	167	 On the basis of the immunoprecipitation data shown in Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	168	 3 and previous studies (2, 6, 14, 46), we expected CFTR to be located intracellularly in MDCK-AA7 monolayers grown using conventional methodology.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Indeed, punctate CFTR immunofluorescence was localized within a perinuclear compartment of the submerged cells.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To test the hypothesis that improved cellular oxygenation mediates the increase in CFTR maturation and cell surface expression, we cultured submerged MDCK-AA7 monolayers in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 for 5-6 days.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Figure 6 compares representative records from monolayers grown under identical conditions except for the culture atmosphere, which contained either 95% O2 (dashed line) or room O2 (solid line).

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Since both monolayers were grown under identical conditions except for a fivefold increase in PO2, we conclude that increased oxygen mediates the 50-fold increase in Cl secretion.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization of CFTR further revealed that culturing submerged monolayers with 95% oxygen produced similar changes in the mobility and cellular localization of CFTR as air-liquid interface culture (data not shown, also refer to Fig.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Since CFTR maturation and cell surface expression are augmented by oxygen in MDCK-AA7 cells, we further predict that the forskolin-stimulated Isc should increase as the volume of apical media is decreased.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This prediction is based on the notion that the apical media acts as a barrier to oxygen diffusion (refer to DISCUSSION).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	243	 We tested this hypothesis by growing MDCK-AA7 cells for 6 days with 40, 80, 160, or 300  microl of apical MEM and then assaying for forskolin-stimulated Isc.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	244	 These data are summarized in Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Indeed, the CFTR-mediated Isc (Isc-forskolin) increased with decreasing volumes of media (left), and the plot of Isc-forskolin as a function of volume1 is suggestive of a linear relationship (right).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The minimum depth tested that permitted maximum current was ~0.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Moreover, these data show that even modest changes in media volume (i.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Thus we have identified an important caveat regarding the study of endogenous CFTR expression using conventional cell culture technique.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The large unstirred layer of medium overlaying cells in culture limits the amount of oxygen available for cellular respiration.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Figure 10 illustrates how the partial pressure of O2 will vary as a linear relation of the media depth (d), given a steady state.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	262	 This relationship is derived from a simple force-flow relation (i.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	263	, Fick's law) (1) where the flow of oxygen (JO2, in units of milliliters per minute per cm2 of cells) is directly proportional to the difference between PO2 at the air-media interface [(PO2)air] and the cells [(PO2)cell] and the O2 diffusion constant of Krough for water at 37 degrees C (k = 3.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	276	, Fick's law) and assumes that oxygen diffusion and utilization have reached steady state.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	277	Maneuvers that improve oxygenation in cultures either by stirring the overlaying fluid layer using a rocking shaker (12, 47) or rolling bottle (20) or by reducing the medium depth with an air-liquid interface (27, 30, 36, 41, 43, 52, 54) enhance cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation in a variety of cells.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Hypoxia can also have important functional consequences.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	279	 For example, monolayers of kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells are only gluconeogenic (39) and ammoniagenic (8) as observed in vivo when cells are cultured in the presence of increased oxygen levels.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Similarly, pancreatic -cells have been shown to release insulin only in normoxic cultures (13).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The data contained in the present study demonstrate that improved cellular oxygenation markedly augments CFTR function, maturation, and localization in a model cell line.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	282	Assuming that MDCK-AA7 cells consume oxygen at a similar rate as hepatic (53), LLC-PK1 (8), 3T3 (53), or L cells (59), Eq.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	283	 2 predicts that confluent MDCK-AA7 monolayers submerged under our conventional conditions (i.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	284	 We further expect that either removing the apical media or culturing these monolayers with an approximate fivefold increase in oxygen should restore cellular PO2 to approximately normoxic levels (53).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Indeed, both maneuvers caused similar increases in CFTR-mediated Isc and cell surface expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	286	 However, these data do not exclude the alternative hypothesis that conventional cultures are normoxic and that the effects of 95% O2 were mediated by hyperoxia (58).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus we exposed air-liquid interface cultures to varying PO2 (Figs.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The use of CFTR as a bioassay indicates that conventional MDCK-AA7 cultures are hypoxic, as predicted by Eq.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Furthermore, these data show that CFTR maturation and function varies with physiological oxygenation.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Interestingly, the increase in PO2 between arterial and venous blood may cause a two- to threefold enhancement of CFTR expression.

0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	292	 One question that arises from this study is, Why do conventional culture conditions nearly abolish CFTR expression in MDCK-AA7 cells, whereas T84 cells grown under identical conditions express high levels of mature CFTR protein (refer to Fig.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	293	 3)? One possible explanation comes from previous studies by Dickman and Mandel (12) and others showing that the poor oxygenation in culture favors the proliferation and growth of cells with enhanced glycolysis (4, 12, 37, 40).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The selection and evolution in vitro is expected to be driven further by media formulated with high glucose (25 mM) and containing few substrates for oxidative phosphorylation.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Indeed, T84 cells express few mitochondria (T.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Hence differences in metabolism should be considered in future studies of wild-type and mutant CFTR.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	297	Moreover, the ability of air-liquid interface culture to increase cAMP-dependent Cl secretion is not limited to MDCK-AA7 cells.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	298	 An augmented Cl secretory response following air-liquid interface culture has been observed in three cell lines; Calu-3 (52), MDCK-AA7 (this article), and several T84 clones (Venglarik, unpublished data) as well as in primary cultures of airway epithelial cells (Ref.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	299	 30 and Venglarik, unpublished data).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The observation that CFTR-expressing epithelial cells derived from airways, kidney, and colon respond similarly to air-liquid interface culture is suggestive of a relationship between oxygen tension and Cl secretion in vivo.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	301	 It is also likely that the mediator and cellular mechanisms underlying the enhanced Cl secretory Isc are the same.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Hence, this study provides important new insight regarding a relationship between cellular oxygenation and CFTR maturation and trafficking and identifies a model cell line to further investigate the underlying mechanisms.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	303	Possible role of metabolism in CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Previous studies show that vectorial transport is reduced by conditions that decrease oxidative phosphorylation, presumably to preserve cellular integrity (7,17).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that oxygen-induced increase in CFTR expression in MDCK-AA7 cells may also be related to improved metabolism.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	306	 We and others have shown that decreasing the cellular ATP/ADP ratio can acutely limit Cl secretion by reducing the open probability of the CFTR Cl channels (19, 50).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The results presented in this article are suggestive of a more long-term mechanism whereby a decrease in oxygen can reduce the number of CFTR channels present in the apical membrane.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Such an adaption may help conserve energy either during prolonged periods of moderate hypoxia or under conditions where ATP is being consumed by either vectorial transport or other metabolic pathways (17).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	309	 There is already evidence that air-liquid interface culture markedly increases oxidative phosphorylation in primary cultures of bovine airway cells (31).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	310	 MDCK-AA7 cells should provide a convenient model for future studies investigating the precise relationship between cellular metabolism and CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	311	 We have identified an important source of variability in CFTR cell surface localization that may explain why some cells have F508 CFTR at the plasma membranes while others have none.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Indeed, many freshly isolated epithelial cells and cultured epithelial cells grown with an air-liquid interface have functionally or biochemically detectable levels of F508 CFTR at the cell surface (14, 28, 44, 49, 60, 62), whereas most conventional cultures do not (6, 11, 21, 25).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	313	 (49) were the first to demonstrate that the 180-kDa form of F508 CFTR was expressed in the apical membranes of primary and immortalized CF cell lines (49).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	314	 On the basis of the oxygen dependence of wild-type CFTR expression in MDCK-AA7 cells, we consider it likely that some of the variation in F508 CFTR cell surface expression is due to hypoxic culture conditions.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	315	Furthermore, although there is evidence that the maturation and trafficking of F508 CFTR may be defective in heterologous systems (6), little is known regarding the processes that normally regulate CFTR biogenesis.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Our data show that oxygen can modulate endogenous CFTR expression posttranscriptionally.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Oxygen is known to regulate the expression of several other proteins at this level (22, 26, 29, 48).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	318	 For example, normoxia promotes the translation and/or folding of cytochrome c oxidase (22), while hypoxia abolishes the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (26, 48) and stabilizes the plasma membrane form of the glucose transporter GLUT-3 (29).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Increased synthesis, decreased degradation, or an extended half-life are three possible mechanisms for the O2-enhanced CFTR expression.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	320	 We have been unable to detect augmented synthesis of CFTR in air-liquid interface cultures of MDCK-AA7 cells using 35S-met pulse chase analysis (data not shown).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Hence, we speculate that the increased levels of fully glycosylated (170-kDa) CFTR may be due to increased maturation and/or stability at the apical plasma membrane.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	322	 There is already some evidence to suggest that normoxia causes apical membranes to differentiate both functionally (47) and morphologically (30, 41).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Thus it is possible that the improvement in CFTR biogenesis is mediated by a more global mechanism designed to regulate the composition and/or architecture of the apical membranes during differentiation.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	324	Finally, many CF patients are hypoxic due to mucus plugs in the small airways and progressive loss of lung function (18, 24, 57).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	325	 If F508 CFTR cell surface expression depends on oxygenation, then there may be some correlation between nasal potential difference and pulmonary function among this subset of CF patients.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Indeed, two recent reports show that the basal nasal potential difference was similar to nonaffected controls in a subpopulation of CF patients that have normal pulmonary function (18, 24).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Although these results are somewhat controversial, they are consistent with studies localizing mutant CFTR at or near the apical membranes of F508 homozygous patients (14, 44, 49, 60, 62).
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Thus CF patients with at least one F508 allele (i.
0.4332927.11121385.html.plaintext.txt	329	, 92% of the total CF population) may benefit from maneuvers that improve tissue oxygenation or drugs that mimic oxygen signaling pathways in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells.

0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	221	 1999 ), we hypothesized that COOH-terminal truncations may interfere with the recycling of CFTR and lead to premature endolysosomal proteolysis.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	222	To test this hypothesis, the disposal rate of the metabolically labeled, complex-glycosylated T70 and T82 CFTR was measured in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors after allowing the conversion of the core- into complex-glycosylated form (Fig 2 A).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The degradation rate was unaltered upon exposing the cells to NH4Cl, chloroquin, or bafilomycin B, agents that inhibit endolysosomal proteolysis by dissipating the acidic luminal pH and interfering with cargo delivery (Fig 2 B).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Similarly, leupeptin and pepstatin A, inhibitors of cathepsins B, H, L, N, S, and T (Seglen 1983 ), have a negligible effect on the degradation rate (Fig 2A and Fig B) and the steady state expression of truncated CFTRs (Fig 2 C).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In contrast, these drugs stabilized the interleukin 2 receptor chain (Tac), which is targeted for lysosomal degradation (Fig 2 D; Hemar et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	226	 1995 ), validating their efficacy and suggesting that the initial proteolysis of the truncated CFTR is largely independent of endolysosomal proteases.

0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Surprisingly, leupeptin and pepstatin A provoked the accumulation of degradation intermediates of both wt and T70 CFTR predominantly in lysosomes (Fig 3 B).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	233	 These inhibitors also provoked the appearance of breakdown products in isolated lysosomes of intestinal epithelia (CaCo-2 and T84) expressing CFTR endogenously, implying that lysosomal proteolysis cannot be attributed to heterologous overexpession (data not shown).

0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Comparable inhibition was observed when lactacystin was added after the pulse labeling (Fig 4 C) or after a 2-h chase (Fig 4 D).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This latter protocol has ensured that augmented conversion of the core- to the complex-glycosylated form was not attributable to the lactacystin effect.

0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	340	We presented compelling evidence indicating that the dramatically decreased expression level and residence time of the complex-glycosylated truncated CFTR cannot be attributed to missorting for lysosomal degradation at the trans-Golgi or endosomal compartment.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Instead, the truncated CFTR is targeted to the plasma membrane with comparable efficiency to its wt counterpart (Fig 1).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The turnover of the total and cell surface biotinylated T70 CFTR pools was insensitive to inhibitors of endolysosomal proteases.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	343	 In contrast, weak bases and cathepsin inhibitors stabilized the full-length form and degradation intermediates of wt CFTR in transfected cells as well as in epithelia, highlighting the multiple role of endolysosomal proteolysis in the turnover of wt CFTR (Fig 2 and Fig 3).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	344	Several criteria were used to establish that proteasomes are involved in the accelerated metabolism of the truncated CFTR from post-Golgi compartments, including the cell surface.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	345	 First, the degradation rates of the complex-glycosylated T70, 82, and 98 CFTR were delayed in the presence of lactacystin, the most specific inhibitor of proteasome (Fenteany et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Second, a dramatic extension of the plasma membrane residence time of biotinylated T70 CFTR was evoked by lactacystin (Fig 6), implying that proteasomes are indispensable in the proteolysis of the truncated CFTR from the cell surface and/or endosomal compartment.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Since proteasome inhibitors had no impact on the degradation of Tac-Lamp1, an indirect effect of lactacystin on lysosomal proteolysis could be precluded (Fig 5).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Third, MG132 and lactacystin evoked the accumulation of polyubiqutinated adducts of the complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR, consistent with the notion that a fraction of the T70 CFTR is tagged by polyubiquitin chain(s) before degradation (Fig 7).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Finally, both MG132 and lactacystin partially restored the expression level of complex-glycosylated T70, T82, and T98 CFTR, as well as the plasma membrane cAMP-activated chloride conductance of T70 CFTR transfectants without facilitating the biogenesis of the mutants (Fig 5D and Fig E).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Although these observations indicate that proteasome activity is one of the rate-limiting steps for the turnover of the full-length complex-glycosylated T70 CFTR, proteasome inhibitors failed to restore the mutant stability to that of the wt CFTR.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	351	 This could be explained by incomplete inhibition of proteasome activity and/or the involvement of other, presently unidentified proteolytic mechanisms.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	352	The COOH-terminal tail of CFTR might confer stability to the mature CFTR by several mechanisms or a combination thereof.

0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	355	 However, this possibility appears to be unlikely, since the steady state expression level and turnover rate of a CFTR variant lacking the COOH-terminal 26 amino acid residues are normal (Mickle et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Neither can aggregation of T70 CFTR at the trans-Golgi or at early endosomes target the mutant for lysosomal degradation.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Finally, the absence of the COOH-terminal tail may structurally destabilize the folded CFTR, increasing the portion of nonnative molecules that are susceptible to proteolysis.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	358	Evidence suggests that nonnative states of soluble polypeptides induced by mutations or thermal or chemical denaturation can lead to accelerated degradation (Parsell and Lindquist 1993 ; Hershko and Ciechanover 1998 ; Brodsky and McCracken 1999 ; Plemper and Wolf 1999 ), a paradigm that may apply to the degradation of nonnative plasma membrane proteins, including the truncated CFTR, as well.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Based on the enhanced protease susceptibility and the decreased in vivo thermostability of T70 CFTR (Fig 8 and Fig 9), we speculate that structural destabilization of the native form is induced by disrupting interaction(s) of the COOH terminus.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Using various yeast screening assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the Deg-1 proteolytic motif in the MAT2 transcription factor, it has been established that ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc6 and Ubc7) can recognize hydrophobic stretches and exposed hydrophobic surfaces on amphipathic helices (Sadis et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	361	 These or similar motifs, normally buried inside the globular domains of CFTR or inserted into the membrane plane, may serve as recognition signal(s).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	362	 In support of this notion, the decreased plasma membrane residence time and impaired expression level of the ss2- and the 2A-adrenergic receptors were also attributed to structural destabilization (Gether et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	363	 1997 ; Wilson and Limbird 2000 ).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	364	 However, the mechanism responsible for the downregulation of these G protein to coupled receptors, which could be partially rescued with ligand stabilization, has remained obscure.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	365	A key question that remains to be resolved is whether ubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasome-dependent degradation of the mutant CFTR from the cell surface or endosomal compartment.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Several tyrosine kinase and G protein to coupled receptors have been observed to undergo ligand-induced ubiquitination and downregulation via lysosomal and/or proteasomal degradation (Bonifacino and Weismann 1998 ; Hershko and Ciechanover 1998 ; Hicke 1999 ; Strous and Govers 1999 ).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Ubiquitination also appears to be necessary and sufficient to induce the internalization and downregulation of plasma membrane receptors and transporters (e.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	368	, FUR4, GAP1, STE2, STE3, and STE6) via vacuolar proteolysis in yeast (Hicke 1999 ).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	369	 The constitutive downregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in association with the Nedd4 ubiquitin-ligase, was proposed to follow a similar degradation route, in contrast to the unassembled subunits of the channel, which were degraded by a proteasome-dependent mechanism at the ER (Staub et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	370	Since both covalent and noncovalent attachment of ubiquitins can serve as a degradation signal of plasma membrane proteins via internalization (Govers et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	371	 2000 ), one possible scenario is that augmented ubiquitination of CFTR, or an associated protein, facilitates the internalization of the mutant.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	372	 On the other hand, in light of multiple tyrosine- and dileucine-based endocytic signals in CFTR, ubiquitin attachment may not be a prerequisite for endocytosis (Lukacs et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Consistent with the dispensable nature of ubiquitination, downregulation of the ss2-adrenergic and mutant m2-muscarinic receptors can proceed without endocytosis, presumably by direct association with proteasome and/or other, presently unidentified proteases (Jockers et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	374	 1999 ; Wilson and Limbird 2000 ).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	375	 The recognition that both 26S proteasome and P700 subunit are able to degrade nonnative polypeptides lacking polyubiquitin conjugates supports the notion that a ubiquitin-independent degradation mechanism cannot be ruled out (Murakami 1992 ; Braun et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Importantly, these degradation pathways are not mutually exclusive and may function in parallel.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	377	Since the retrograde translocation of the T70 CFTR via the translocon is unlikely to occur in post-Golgi compartments (Xiong et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	378	 1999 ), the coordinated action of multiple proteolytic systems is invoked to resolve the topological problem of disposing transmembrane segments and exofacial loops of the T70 CFTR.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Degradation appears to be initiated by the unfolding of cytosolic domains in a proteasome-dependent manner.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	380	 The biochemical as well as functional rescue of cell surface resident T70, but not wt CFTR (data not shown), by proteasome inhibitors substantiate this hypothesis.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Whereas the initial cleavage of the mature wt CFTR, as opposed to mutant, relies on the activity of lysosmal proteases, subsequent degradation of wt and T70 CFTR converges in endolysosomes, demonstrated by their overlapping proteolytic fragmentation pattern in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors (Fig 3 B).
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	382	Although the truncated CFTR is one of the first mutant plasma membrane proteins subjected to sequential proteasomal and lysosomal breakdown, the coordinated action of these proteolytic systems is not without precedent.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Although both lysosomes and proteasomes are involved in the constitutive and ligand-induced disposal of connexin43, the renal Na/Pi cotransporter, and the PDGF ss receptor, respectively (Mori et al.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	384	 1998 ), the recognition mechanism of these substrates by the proteasome remains unknown.
0.45175216.11381082.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Considering that deletion of the COOH-terminal tail appears to destabilize CFTR structurally, we propose that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may play a role in the recognition and elimination of not only the T70 CFTR, but also other nonnative or partially unfolded plasma membrane proteins.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	4	In order to gain a better insight into the structure and function of the regulatory domain (RD) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, 19 RD missense mutations that had been identified in patients were functionally characterized.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nine of these (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P) resulted in aberrant processing.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Mutants that induced a whole cell current that was significantly different from wild-type CFTR were subsequently analysed at the single channel level in COS1 cells transiently expressing the different mutant and wild-type proteins.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three mutant chloride channels, G622D, R792G and E822K CFTR, were characterized by significantly lower intrinsic chloride channel activities compared with wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Two mutations, H620Q and A800G, resulted in increased intrinsic chloride transport activities.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, T665S and E826K CFTR had single channel properties not significantly different from wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	14	Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The disease is characterized by abnormal salt transport across the apical border of epithelial cells (1).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The CFTR protein (2-4) is a transmembrane protein consisting of two repeated motifs, each composed of a transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), separated by a highly charged regulatory domain (RD).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The RD consists of alternating clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acids and harbours multiple consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) (3).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	18	Reconstitution of the CFTR protein into proteoliposomes proved that it forms a linear low conductance chloride channel (5).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Activation of CFTR is complex and occurs in different steps.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	20	 First, the RD is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent PKA.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This step is enhanced through pre-stimulation with PKC (6).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In a second step, ATP binds to and is hydrolysed at the first NBD, thereby opening the channel and allowing chloride ions to flow down the electrochemical gradient.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In a third step, ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 closes the channel (7).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As long as the RD is phosphorylated, ATP can re-open the channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Dephosphorylation of the RD by phosphatases (8) results in final closure of the channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	26	The precise mechanisms by which the RD regulates anion flow is far from understood.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although the RD contains nine consensus sites for PKA, they all are redundant and phosphorylation at a single site is sufficient for channel activation (9).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Given the fact that activation of CFTR can only occur through PKA phosphorylation, this degeneration of phosphorylation sites is very puzzling.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	29	 On the other hand, the channel can be locked in the activated state through mutagenesis of Ser to Asp moieties at the PKA consensus sites (10).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This observation indicates that negative charges introduced by PKA phosphorylation are important for channel activation.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Deleting part of the RD (amino acids 708-835) will also yield a CFTR channel that escapes PKA regulation and that is constitutively active (11).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It was therefore hypothesized that the RD closes the chloride channel pore and that it will be repulsed from the pore when negative charges are introduced.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although these [Delta]R-CFTR proteins are constitutively active, their open probability (Po) is only one third of that found for wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, addition of an unphosphorylated RD to [Delta]R-CFTR has no effect on this channel activity, while addition of a phosphorylated RD doubles the Po.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This increase in activity apparently results from a higher rate of channel opening because of a higher sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Based on these findings it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of the RD changes the sensitivity of NBD1 for ATP (12,13).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	37	Given the crucial role of the RD in the regulation of channel activities, a thorough knowledge of its structure and function is warranted.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In this regard, the known RD missense mutations found in patients could provide important information about the metabolism and the function of the RD.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Our investigations of 19 missense mutations will show that some mutations affect protein maturation, others lead to decreased function or gain of function, while still others appear to have no effect in the assay systems used.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	40	RESULTS Cross-species analysis of the RD.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	41	When exon 13 sequences of CFTR from nine different organisms were aligned (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	42	 1), a high conservation of the N-terminal part (RD1, up to amino acid 650) was observed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In the C-terminal two- thirds (RD2), only the PKA phosphorylation sites were conserved and they were all located in this subdomain.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The RD is highly charged, in part due to the presence of PKA consensus sequences which are highly basic.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Two acidic amino acid stretches were found.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The first one (amino acids 725-730) is located in the first half of RD2 and, although this region is poorly conserved, its negative charge was found in all species studied.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The second acid region (amino acids 822-828) was located at the end of the RD and was completely conserved.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Alignment of exon 13 sequences derived from different species.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	56	 192567) were aligned using the GENALIGN multiple sequence alignment program of the Intelligenetics software.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Mutations detected in patients (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, H620Q, D622G, G628R, L633P, T665S, F693L, K698R, V754M, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) are indicated in bold and underlined, the PKA phosphorylation sites by an arrow and the two acidic domains are boxed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	58	Of the 21 RD missense mutations, three (K698R, R766M and R792G) were located in PKA recognition consensus sites.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Only R766M and R792G disrupted a PKA recognition site and might therefore interfere with CFTR regulation.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The different RD mutations affected almost all, except D648V, V754M and A800G, amino acid moieties that were absolutely or highly conserved.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The high conservation of these mutated amino acids highlights their importance for structure and function.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Six of the 21 disease mutations affected the charge of the amino acid residue and two even resulted in an amino acid of opposite charge.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The latter two were located in the highly conserved C-terminal acidic domain.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	64	Effect of RD mutations on CFTR processing.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	65	At the beginning of this study, 19 different RD mutations (Table 1) had been described in patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Since then, it was found that the F693L mutation is a polymorphism (14,15) and that the I807M polymorphism is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) (our unpublished data).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Two additional disease mutations, which were not characterized at the functional level in this study, were identified [K698R and V754M (15)].
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The nature by which all the RD mutations cause CFTR dysfunction is, however, unknown.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	69	 It is known that some CFTR mutations, like F508, cause misfolding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in retention and degradation by the quality control system that operates in this cell compartment (16).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Therefore, we first determined the maturation pattern of the different mutant CFTR proteins listed in Table 1.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The different mutations were introduced into wild-type CFTR cDNA, inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and the mutant constructs were transfected into COS1 cells.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The corresponding proteins were analysed by means of pulse chase experiments.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	73	 When CFTR translation products enter the ER, they become glycosylated through addition of two high-mannose glycosyl groups on the fourth extracellular loop.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This event gives rise to the appearance of a 150 kDa protein, the most prominent form of wild-type CFTR after 30 min chase (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	75	 As the protein leaves the ER and enters the Golgi apparatus, the glycosyl groups become modified to complex sugar groups and this gives rise to a protein with lower mobility (190 kDa), as can be seen in lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 2.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Only the 190 kDa protein will move further to the plasma membrane and will contribute to chloride channel activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This maturation pattern was found not only for wild-type CFTR but also for some of the mutants (Table 2), such as I807M CFTR (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Some of the mutants, however, presented an abnormal maturation pattern, as can be seen for L610S and D614G CFTR (Fig.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These mutant proteins only yielded the 150 kDa form, even after 210 min chase, indicating that they gave rise to misfolded proteins that were retained and degraded in the ER.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In order to confirm that the 150 kDa form was indeed the ER form and the 190 kDa form was the complex glycosylated one, two enzymatic digestions were performed (results not shown).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	81	 When the immunopurified proteins were incubated with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that only recognizes and cleaves off high-mannose residues, only the 150 kDa forms of the maturing and non-maturing mutants were digested.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	82	 N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that recognizes and degrades high-mannose and complex glycosyl groups, degraded the 150 kDa as well as the 190 kDa form.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The mutations that gave rise to a protein that was not able to proceed to the 190 kDa form (I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P; Table 2) are therefore class two mutations (17), where the disease phenotype is caused by the absence of sufficient CFTR protein at the cell surface.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Cells expressing GFP were selected and used for single channel measurements.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The number of channels was estimated by overlapping sweep events.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	143	05) and the number of cells patched is indicated.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	144	Since the discovery of the CFTR gene, 21 RD missense mutations have been identified in patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	145	 We studied the effect of 19 of these mutations (Table 1) on the maturation and electrophysiological properties of CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Nine mutations caused aberrant processing: I601F, L610S, A613T, D614G, I618T, L619S, H620P, G628R and L633P.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	147	 A very striking observation was that all mutations that caused a processing defect were clustered in the N-terminal part (amino acids 601-619) of the RD, while those that showed a normal maturation pattern were clustered in the C-terminal end (amino acids 648-826).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	148	 These effects were not caused by the different types of mutations that had been introduced, since similar amino acid changes were found in both subdomains.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In the region linking these two parts the effect of a mutation depends on the amino acid change introduced.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This is illustrated for amino acid 620, where two different mutations were detected in CF patients.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	151	 When His620 was changed to Gln, no effect on maturation was observed.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	152	 When His620 was changed to Pro, an amino acid that dramatically affects the secondary structure of the protein and therefore possibly its correct folding, a non-maturing protein was obtained.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It should be noted, however, that the effects of mutations involving Pro are not that dramatic when they are located in the second subdomain of CFTR, since a recombinant protein in which three wild-type Pro residues were mutated still formed the mature 190 kDa form (18).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	154	The RD has initially been assigned to that portion of the CFTR protein that is encoded by exon 13.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that the RD can be divided into two subdomains.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Cross-species analysis revealed that the N-terminal part of this domain has been highly conserved at the amino acid level during evolution, from shark to human, while in the C-terminal two-thirds only the phosphorylation sites are conserved (19).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Moreover, all the RD phosphorylation sites are exclusively located in this second part.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	158	 A new model for NBD1 was recently obtained by computational modelling, based on the X-ray structure of bovine mitochondrial F1 ATPase.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	159	 According to this model, amino acids 453-650, which have so far been attributed to the exon 13 RD, are in fact predicted to be part of NBD1 (20).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Here we found that missense mutations located in this part of the RD fail to mature, a characteristic of the majority of NBD1 mutations (21).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	161	Mutations that did not affect maturation (H620Q, G622D, D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, R792G, A800G, I807M, E822K and E826K) were subsequently analysed at the electrophysiological level.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	162	Three of these (G622D, R792G and E822K) gave rise to chloride channels with significantly lower Po than the wild-type channel.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	163	 One of these mutations, R792G, disrupts a consensus recognition site for PKA.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Since it was shown that this site is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA (9) and that it is one of the strongest stimulatory sites for CFTR activation (22), elimination of this PKA recognition sequence might result in a chloride channel with aberrant regulation and, as a consequence, lower activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Strikingly, two mutations (H620Q and A800G) showed a significantly increased Po, when compared with wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	166	 So far, only the P574H mutation, located in NBD1, has been shown to give rise to a protein with higher intrinsic chloride transport properties.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This mutant, however, does not mature (23,24).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The `hyperactive' disease-causing mutations described here, H620Q and A800G, do mature.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	169	The remaining mutations (D648V, T665S, F693L, R766M, I807M and E826K) caused no significant alterations in intrinsic chloride channel activity.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	170	 F693L turned out to be a polymorphism (15), thereby explaining its normal function.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	171	Apart from being a chloride channel, CFTR is also a regulator of other channels.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	172	 It was found that CFTR is a negative regulator of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (25-28) and a positive regulator of outwardly rectifying chloride channels (29,30), of potassium channels (31) and of an ATP channel associated with CFTR (32).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, mutant proteins that have a wild-type or an increased channel activity may cause a CF phenotype due to abnormal regulatory properties.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In view of the fact that the RD is quite unique for CFTR, compared with other ATP-binding cassette proteins, and that an interaction between the RD and the ATP channel has been shown, this domain becomes the prime candidate to play a crucial role in the regulatory activities of CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	175	We have recently shown that polymorphic alleles, like those found at the M470V locus, can also affect CFTR properties, both at the maturational and the electrophysiological levels (33).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The `normal' or `hyperfunctional' mutations could therefore cause CFTR malfunctioning when present on a particular haplotype background.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Since the haplotypes were not known for most of the mutations studied, their functional effect might have been masked.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	178	 On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that these patients carried an as yet undetected second mutation on the same CFTR allele.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	179	 As a result, the studied exon 13 mutation would then be a polymorphism.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	180	In conclusion, based on the maturation studies, the CFTR RD can be subdivided into two subdomains: the N-terminal one-third of exon 13, which is very sensitive to missense mutations, and the C-terminal part of exon 13, which shows less stringent structural requirements.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	181	 For some mutations, however, no defect in maturation could be detected.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, they gave rise to chloride channels with intrinsic activities that were similar to or even higher than wild-type CFTR.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Further experiments are required to clarify the mechanism by which the latter mutations cause disease.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	184	MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of RD mutants.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	185	An XhoI-KpnI fragment containing the CFTR coding region was isolated from the prokaryotic vector pTG5960 (Transgene SA, Strasbourg, France) and inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In order to remove a potential ATG start codon derived from the multiple cloning site of pTG5960, the construct was digested with KpnI and EcoRV and the resulting linear plasmid was blunt-end ligated after T4 DNA polymerase treatment.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The CFTR coding region present in the resulting construct was characterized by dideoxy sequencing and one polymorphism, V470, was identified.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The sequence also contained three neutral amino acid changes (t930c, a933g and t936c) that had been introduced in order to inactivate a cryptic prokaryotic promoter (36).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	189	 All RD missense mutations that had been reported before May 23, 1996, to the Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Analysis Consortium (Table 1) were introduced using the Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA).
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 1.

0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	193	 For this purpose, wild-type CFTR cDNA derived from pcDNA3-CFTR was ligated as a T4 DNA polymerase-treated XhoI-SacI fragment in pCINeo/IRES-GFP.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The latter had first been linearized with NheI, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and dephosphorylated with bovine alkaline phosphatase.
0.4141868.9736778.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The RD and its flanking sequences were subsequently removed from pCINeo/wtCFTR-IRES-GFP by complete digestion with XbaI and partial digestion with BstXI and was replaced by the corresponding mutant CFTR fragments that had been obtained by complete digestion of the different mutant pcDNA3-CFTR constructs with XbaI and BstXI.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	4	Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The most common disease-causing mutation, F508, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To investigate whether the ER retention of F508-CFTR is caused by immobilization and/or aggregation, we have measured the diffusional mobility of green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	7	 GFP-labeled F508-CFTR was localized in the ER and wt-CFTR in the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes in transfected COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Both chimeras localized to the ER after brefeldin A treatment.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Spot photobleaching showed that CFTR diffusion (diffusion coefficient ~109 cm2/s) was not significantly slowed by the F508 mutation and that nearly all wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR diffused throughout the ER without restriction.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Stabilization of molecular chaperone interactions by ATP depletion produced remarkable F508-CFTR immobilization (~50%) and slowed diffusion (6.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	11	5  x  1010 cm2/s) but had little effect on wt-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Fluorescence depletion experiments revealed that the immobilized F508-CFTR in ATP-depleted cells remained in an ER pattern.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The mobility of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR was reduced by maneuvers that alter CFTR processing or interactions with molecular chaperones, including tunicamycin, geldanamycin, and lactacystin.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Photobleaching of the fluorescent ER lipid diOC4(3) showed that neither ER restructuring nor fragmentation during these maneuvers was responsible for the slowing and immobilization of CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These results suggest that (a) the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to restricted ER mobility, (b) the majority of F508-CFTR is not aggregated or bound to slowly moving membrane proteins, and (c) F508-CFTR may interact to a greater extent with molecular chaperones than does wt-CFTR.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	17	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR)1 mediates transepithelial chloride transport across epithelial cells in the airways, intestine, pancreas, and sweat gland.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Some mutations in CFTR cause the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis, which produces chronic lung infection, progressively impaired pulmonary function, and pancreatic insufficiency.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The most common CFTR mutant, F508-CFTR, is retained at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently is unable to function as a plasma membrane chloride channel (1).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Electrophysiological studies indicate that the ER-retained F508-CFTR is at least partially functional in excised ER membranes (2).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Further, growth of F508-CFTR-expressing cells under non-physiological conditions (low temperature, Ref.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	22	 3 or with chemical chaperones, Ref.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	23	 4) indicates that under certain conditions F508-CFTR can be transported to the plasma membrane and restore cell chloride permeability.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	24	CFTR biosynthesis is an inefficient process.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Newly synthesized wild type (wt)-CFTR and F508-CFTR are folded into the ER membrane where they become core-glycosylated (5, 6).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Only 20-30% of newly synthesized wt-CFTR is transported to the Golgi where complex glycosylation occurs, with the remaining protein ubiquinated and degraded by the proteasome (7, 8).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Wild type CFTR exists initially in a protease-susceptible form (t1/2 ~30 min) that becomes more stable upon transport from ER to Golgi (t1/2 ~24 h), whereas F508-CFTR is rapidly degraded (t1/2 ~30 min) (5, 6).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Inhibition of proteasome function results in the formation of aggresomes, which are detergent-insoluble, perinuclear protein aggregates common to many degenerative diseases (9-11).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	29	CFTR folding in the ER appears to be facilitated by interactions with the cellular quality control machinery.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Wild type CFTR and F508-CFTR have been shown to interact with the molecular chaperones Hsc70, Hdj2, Hsp70, Hsp90, and calnexin but not with BiP or Grp94 (12-15).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Recent data suggest that the Hsc70 co-chaperone CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) targets immature CFTR for proteasome-mediated degradation (16).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Biochemical data indicate that calnexin and Hsp70 bind F508-CFTR more avidly than wt-CFTR (12, 13).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The differential processing of F508-CFTR and wt-CFTR, however, is probably not accounted for by gross structural differences.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Proteolytic cleavage experiments have suggested that the conformation of F508-CFTR is similar to that of the early, relatively unstable form of wt-CFTR (17).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In vitro folding studies of the isolated nucleotide binding domain 1 (containing the phenylalanine 508 residue) support the view that the F508 mutation does not affect structure (18, 19) but may affect folding kinetics.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	36	Here we have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to measure the diffusional mobility of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR at the ER to investigate whether F508-CFTR immobilization or interaction with chaperones is responsible for its ER retention.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the failure of F508-CFTR to be exported from the ER: immobilization of F508-CFTR, potentially by association with chaperones or by self-aggregation; efficient F508-CFTR recycling from the Golgi; and/or failure of the ER export machinery to recognize F508-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Photobleaching measurements were done on cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR; a series of maneuvers was used to probe for interactions with CFTR processing machinery.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	39	 It was shown previously that GFP fusion to the N terminus of CFTR did not effect CFTR localization, processing, or function (9, 20-22).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We used photobleaching previously to quantify aqueous phase rheology in cellular and organellar compartments (23-25) and to investigate protein-protein interactions of aquaporin (AQP) water channels in the ER and plasma membranes (26, 27).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We find here that the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to immobilization, aggregation, or binding to slow moving membrane components; however, a greater fraction of F508-CFTR than wild type CFTR interacted with molecular chaperones after ATP depletion, and inhibition of CFTR processing by a proteasome inhibitor resulted in CFTR aggregation and immobilization.

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In some experiments transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence prior to diOC4(3) labeling, and those cells were photobleached.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The relatively small amount of GFP had little effect on the recovery of the much brighter and more rapidly diffusing diOC4(3).

0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The simplest interpretation of this finding is that ATP depletion, which stabilizes protein interactions with molecular chaperones, is able to reveal F508-CFTR interactions that are not observable under normal conditions.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	215	 As discussed in the Introduction, F508-CFTR structure is thought to be similar to that of an early intermediate of wt-CFTR, and biochemical evidence supports F508-CFTR associations with molecular chaperones.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	216	Additional maneuvers were performed to investigate specific interactions between wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR and the cellular protein processing machinery.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in significant slowing and immobilization of both wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR, similar to findings for the VSVG glycoprotein (29).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Similar results were found with a glycosylation-null wt-CFTR mutant, which was poorly expressed in the plasma membrane as determined by biotinylation studies (not shown).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Protein glycosylation can facilitate folding, sorting, and quality control (31).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Our data are thus consistent with a role for glycosylation in CFTR folding.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Proteasome inhibition causes the accumulation of deglycosylated wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR in detergent-insoluble, high molecular weight aggregates (9, 32).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Consistent with the observations here, Bebok et al.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	223	 (32) demonstrated an association between the Sec61 translocation system and CFTR that was enhanced by proteasome inhibition.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	224	 After prolonged (14 h) incubation with lactacystin, wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR were found in aggresomes (9, 10).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Aggresomes are vimentin-enclosed, pericentriolar, electron-dense structures that contain aggregates of misfolded, often ubiquinated proteins associated with molecular chaperones and proteasomes.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	226	 As expected, the GFP-CFTR chimeras were completely immobile in aggresomes.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	227	Inhibition of interaction between Hsp90 and CFTR by geldanamycin also slowed the diffusion of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR, with greater immobilization of F508-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Geldanamycin has been shown to disrupt interactions of Hsp90 and CFTR, increasing the degradation rates of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR (14).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Hsp90 has thus been proposed to have a potential role in protecting CFTR from rapid degradation.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The relative immobilization of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after geldanamycin treatment supports a role of Hsp90 for CFTR processing.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	231	 As suggested for VSVG by Nehls et al.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	232	 (29), we believe that the physical state of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR after perturbation of CFTR processing by tunicamycin or geldanamycin may be different from that produced by ATP depletion.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The slowing and immobilization of CFTR by ATP depletion may represent CFTR interactions with molecular chaperones existing in large complexes (33), whereas the immobilization after tunicamycin and geldanamycin, or molecular deglycosylation, may represent CFTR self-aggregation.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Because of the logarithmic relationship between molecular radius and diffusion rate for a protein in a bilayer, substantial aggregates (10-100 units) must be formed to significantly slow diffusion.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The similar responses of wt-CFTR and F508-CFTR to some of the pharmacological maneuvers are consistent with the intrinsically inefficient folding of wt-CFTR, which when compared with P-glycoprotein (another member of the ABC cassette family) is poorly folded.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	236	The diffusion coefficient for CFTR diffusional mobility in the ER, ~10  x  1010 cm2/s, is within the range of other ER membrane proteins that have been studied.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The membrane water channel AQP2 (retained in the ER with BFA) and the ER-retained mutant AQP2-T126M have diffusion coefficients of 2.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Cytochrome P450 2C2, an intrinsic ER protein, has a diffusion coefficient of 5.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	239	 VSVG in its native and misfolded states and two ER resident transmembrane proteins (lamin B receptor and the -subunit of the signal recognition particle receptor) have diffusion coefficients of 26-50  x  1010 cm2/s, depending upon temperature (29).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Two Golgi resident transmembrane proteins (galactosyltransferase and the KDEL receptor) retained in the ER with BFA have diffusion coefficients of 21-48  x  1010 cm2/s, depending upon cell type and temperature (29, 35).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The diffusion coefficient of the ER-retained MHC class 1 molecule H2Ld is 20-46  x  1010 cm2/s and that of TAP1 (transporter associated with antigen presentation 1) is 12  x  1010 cm2/s (36).
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The variation in these diffusion coefficients probably reflects different protein sizes, interactions with ER and cytoplasmic proteins, and ER composition in different cells.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	243	In summary, the photobleaching data provide the following evidence: (a) the ER retention of F508-CFTR is not due to restricted ER mobility, (b) the majority of F508-CFTR is not aggregated or bound to slowly moving membrane proteins, and (c) F508-CFTR may interact to a greater extent with molecular chaperones than does wt-CFTR.
0.44094175.11877404.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Measurements of ER membrane protein diffusion provide a unique in vivo approach to study protein-protein associations that complements classical biochemical and 2-hybrid methods.

0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	4	Although the biosynthetic arrest of the F508 mutant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) can be partially reversed by physical and chemical means, recent evidence suggests that the functional stability of the mutant protein after reaching the cell surface is compromised.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To understand the molecular basis for this observation, the current study directly measured the half-life of F508 and wild-type CFTR at the cell surface of transfected LLC-PK1 cells.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Plasma membrane CFTR expression over time was characterized biochemically and functionally in these polarized epithelial cells.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Surface biotinylation, streptavidin extraction, and quantitative immunoblot analysis determined the biochemical half-life of plasma membrane F508 CFTR to be ~4 h, whereas the plasma membrane half-life of wild-type CFTR exceeded 48 h.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This difference in biochemical stability correlated with CFTR-mediated transport function.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These findings indicate that the F508 mutation decreases the biochemical stability of CFTR at the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We conclude that the F508 mutation triggers more rapid internalization of CFTR and/or its preferential sorting to a pathway of rapid degradation.

0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	13	MOST CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is caused by a gene mutation that results in the deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 of CFTR, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein (13).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The F508 deletion results in a misfolding of the nascent CFTR molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to its retention in the ER by chaparone proteins and its subsequent ubiquitination and premature degradation by the cytoplasmic proteosome complex (reviewed in Ref.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	15	 As a consequence, little if any F508 CFTR is processed to its mature, fully glycosylated form or trafficked to the plasma membrane where CFTR normally functions as a cAMP-activated chloride channel.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Because the F508 mutant retains some intrinsic chloride transport function (8, 18), interest in approaches that drive F508 CFTR past the ER quality control system and to the cell surface has grown.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	17	Several in vitro studies have shown that surface expression of F508 CFTR can be upregulated by chemical or physical means.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Butyrate compounds have been shown to create cAMP-activated chloride currents in cultured F508 cells, presumably by overwhelming the ER quality control system through an increase in gene transcription (4, 28).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Glycerol (30) and low temperature (8) stabilize the conformation of newly synthesized F508, allowing some of it to bypass the ER quality control system and reach biochemical maturity.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	20	 After each of these treatments, an increase in cAMP-activated chloride transport can be detected in the mutant cells.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings suggest that pharmacological agents that downregulate the ER quality control system might be useful in correcting the chloride transport defect in F508 cells.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	22	For this approach to be clinically effective, the F508 protein must maintain some degree of biochemical stability after reaching the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Little is known, however, of the fate of the CFTR protein after it reaches the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Initial work suggested that F508 and wild-type CFTR had similar plasma membrane half-lives (8), but a subsequent in vitro study has shown that cAMP-activated chloride currents in nonpolarized F508 cells are less stable than those in wild-type cells (23).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Because plasma membrane expression of the CFTR proteins was not directly examined in that study, the molecular basis for this observation is not known.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The functional instability in F508 cells could have been due to more rapid inactivation of F508 channels at the cell surface or to more rapid internalization and/or degradation of the mutant protein.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Functional inactivation is supported by data from several studies that show the conduction properties of F508 CFTR differ from those of wild-type CFTR (6, 9, 11).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In fact, a recent electrophysiological study has since confirmed that F508 CFTR is more rapidly inactivated than wild-type CFTR in excised membrane patches (31).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	29	Documented differences in vesicle trafficking of F508 and wild-type CFTR (2, 32) suggest a potential role for membrane trafficking in the regulation of plasma membrane CFTR function.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, technical difficulties in getting measurable quantities of the F508 protein to the cell surface have hindered efforts to compare plasma membrane F508 and wild-type CFTR protein expression.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The current study overcame that obstacle by the simultaneous treatment of cells with low temperature and sodium butyrate, which act synergistically to markedly upregulate surface CFTR expression (12).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	32	 With readily detectable levels of F508 CFTR at the cell surface, it became possible to test the hypothesis that the F508 protein is more biochemically unstable than wild-type CFTR.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Performed in a polarized epithelial cell line, the experiments presented confirm that the biochemical half-life of plasma membrane F508 CFTR is much shorter than that of wild-type CFTR.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These differences in biochemical half-life correlate with transport function, suggesting that rapid internalization and/or degradation of F508 CFTR alone can account for the rapid loss of chloride transport function characteristic of F508 cells.

0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although we were able to detect some functional F508 CFTR at these early time points by the qualitative 125I efflux assay, no functional CFTR expression was detected in F508 cells after 24 h of chase, which contrasts sharply with the persistence of functional CFTR in the wild-type cells at this time.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Similar kinetic studies were performed in transfected (unpolarized) C127 cells, where F508 expression exceeds that of wild-type CFTR after butyrate and low-temperature treatment, and similar half-life values for F508 and wild-type CFTR were obtained (data not shown).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Thus several lines of evidence indicate that the difference in plasma membrane expression of F508 and wild-type CFTR reflects the biology of these two protein species and not simply overexpression.

0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	185	Until the long-term goals of gene therapy are realized, strategies designed to upregulate plasma membrane expression of F508 CFTR remain an important potential therapeutic option in CF (16, 29).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Much emphasis has been placed on the biogenesis of F508 CFTR, with the goal being to overcome its biosynthetic arrest and thereby increase the delivery of functional F508 CFTR channels to the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Effective correction of the CF defect, however, will require stable expression of F508 after reaching the plasma membrane, and one study has shown that the functional half-life of plasma membrane F508 in intact cells is less than that of wild-type CFTR (23).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The current study sought to test the hypothesis that the short functional half-life in F508 cells results from more rapid removal of CFTR channels from the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	189	To study the biochemical stability of plasma membrane F508 CFTR, sufficient quantities of the mutant protein needed to be driven to the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The current study took advantage of combination therapy with sodium butyrate and low temperature to increase surface F508 protein expression to levels sufficient for the direct measurement of CFTR protein half-life by a quantitative immunoblot technique (12).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Thus, in all experiments, cells were pretreated with sodium butyrate and low temperature to upregulate CFTR protein expression and then were followed at 37 degrees C to examine the plasma membrane half-life of each CFTR species.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Because cell polarity can affect membrane trafficking, all experiments were performed in a polarized epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	193	After butyrate and low-temperature treatment, most of the CFTR in these cells was intracellular.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that only the mature, fully glycosylated (band C) form of CFTR reached the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	195	 No evidence for the direct targeting of immature (electrophoretic bands A and B) CFTR to the plasma membrane was found.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Quantitative analysis of CFTR distribution in butyrate/low-temperature-treated LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated that ~65% of band C CFTR remained intracellular.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This was true for both F508 and wild-type CFTR and is similar to observations made in other cell systems (26, 36).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Although changes in band C CFTR expression correlated with changes in plasma membrane CFTR expression in transfected LLC-PK1 cells, this may not be true in all cell types.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus surface protein labeling techniques remain the most accurate means of measuring plasma membrane CFTR expression.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	200	The biochemical finding of a prominent intracellular compartment of CFTR was confirmed immunocytochemically.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	201	 After butyrate/low-temperature treatment, both F508 and wild-type cells labeled similarly, with modest surface but prominent intracellular signals.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The identity of the intracellular signal in each cell type remains unknown.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In the wild-type cells, surface biotinylation demonstrated that most of the unbiotinylated CFTR is of the band C form and therefore is presumably in a post-ER compartment (Golgi, endosomes, transport vesicles, etc.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	204	 In F508 cells, where most of the unbiotinylated CFTR is of the band B form, a large ER component to the intracellular signal would be expected.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Identification of the sources of intracellular CFTR labeling in these cells will, however, require much additional study.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	206	The kinetics of F508 and wild-type CFTR degradation over time was examined at physiological temperature and under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The rate of CFTR degradation was quantified biochemically and confirmed by functional assay.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Replicate experiments indicate that the biochemical half-life of plasma membrane F508 CFTR is ~4 h, whereas the biochemical half-life of plasma membrane wild-type CFTR exceeds 48 h.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These values correlate with changes in 125I efflux and are remarkably similar to the functional data generated by Lukacs et al.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	210	 (23) in nonpolarized C127 cells.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	211	 This time-dependent correlation between the rate of plasma membrane CFTR degradation and the loss of cAMP-stimulated 125I efflux indicates that the functional instability in F508 cells can be theoretically attributed to more rapid degradation of plasma membrane F508 CFTR.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The data, however, do not exclude a contributory role for channel inactivation in this process.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	213	These findings establish that the F508 mutation has a negative effect on the biochemical stability of CFTR at the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This biochemical instability must be due to more rapid internalization of mutant protein and/or its selective targeting for rapid degradation.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	215	 CFTR is endocytosed in clathrin-coated vesicles (1, 22), and the molecular signal for CFTR internalization may reside in its cytoplasmic tail (10, 24, 25).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The F508 mutation, however, is in the first nucleotide-binding domain and is some distance from the cytoplasmic end of the molecule.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus CFTR must have another internalization signal, or the F508 mutation must have an indirect effect on the COOH-terminal signal(s).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Based on our understanding of CFTR folding during biogenesis, it is attractive to hypothesize that the F508 mutation affects CFTR folding in such a manner that the COOH-terminal internalization signal is altered.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The fundamental question is what is the signal? COOH-terminal tyrosine-based sequences have been implicated in the positioning of membrane proteins in coated pits (7, 20), and one recent study has implicated phosphorylation of tyrosine-1424 in the regulation of CFTR endocytosis (25).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	220	 On the other hand, the rate of internalization of Ste6, a yeast homolog of CFTR, and Ste3p, another yeast membrane protein, are regulated by ubiquitination (14, 27).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Because ubiquitination is the major signal for the degradation of both wild-type and F508 CFTR during biogenesis (35), it is provocative to speculate that it is also involved in plasma membrane CFTR degradation.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	222	 During CFTR biosynthesis, ubiquitination targets the immature forms of both F508 and wild-type CFTR to rapid proteosome degradation with similar kinetics (34).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	223	 A pool of wild-type CFTR, however, escapes this fate, becomes fully glycosylated, and reaches the plasma membrane.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	224	 If ubiquitination was also the signal for plasma membrane CFTR degradation, one would have to postulate that the wild-type and mutant proteins were differentially ubiquitinated at the cell surface to account for their different rates of degradation.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Because the yeast data suggest that the proteasome complex is not the final target of ubiquitinated plasma membrane Ste6 (15), one must also consider the possibility that ubiquitination of plasma membrane CFTR serves a different role (e.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	226	, signaling for internalization and/or sorting rather than proteosome degradation).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Although provocative, a role for ubiquitination in the downregulation of surface CFTR expression remains highly speculative at this time.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	228	Alternatively, mutant and wild-type CFTR may have similar rates of internalization but are differentially sorted in the endocytic compartment, with F508 being targeted for rapid lysosomal degradation while wild-type CFTR is recycled back to the plasma membrane.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In this case, the F508 mutation might be affecting the interaction of CFTR with specific GTP-binding (Rab) proteins that regulate vesicle trafficking (reviewed in Ref.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Rab4 has been most closely associated with sorting endosomes, so an understanding of its interactions with F508 and wild-type CFTR would be of particular interest.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Last, one must consider the effect of phosphorylation on CFTR trafficking, particularly in light of data showing that the rate of endocytosis differs in F508 and wild-type cells after cAMP activation (2).
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Although the current study did not examine the biochemical stability of plasma membrane CFTR under stimulatory conditions, the basal phosphorylation state of these two CFTR species may differ, and this, in turn, could expose different internalization signals.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	233	In conclusion, the F508 mutation dramatically reduces the residence time of CFTR at the cell surface.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This must be due to an effect of the mutation on the rate of CFTR internalization and/or its intracellular targeting.
0.48690367.11121388.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Although little is known about this aspect of CFTR biology, it has clear implications for any therapeutic strategies that rely on delivering more F508 protein to the cell surface.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	4	Cystic fibrosis, the most commonly inherited lethal pulmonary disorder in Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To identify genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR in pulmonary tissues in vivo, microarray analyses of lung mRNAs were performed on whole lung tissue from mice lacking (CFTR()) or expressing mouse CFTR (CFTR(+)).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Whereas the histology of lungs from CFTR() and CFTR(+) mice was indistinguishable, statistically significant increases in the relative abundance of 29 and decreases in 25 RNAs were identified by RNA microarray analysis.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Of RNAs whose expression was consistently altered by the absence of CFTR, functional classes of genes influencing gene transcription, inflammation, intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and ion transport were identified.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Likewise, expression of several membrane transport proteins that interact directly with CFTR were increased, suggesting that CFTR-protein complexes initiate genomic responses.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Absence of CFTR influenced the expression of genes modulating diverse pulmonary cell functions that may ameliorate or contribute to the pathogenesis of CF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	12	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	13	Cystic fibrosis (CF)1 is the most common lethal, inherited pulmonary disorder and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	14	 More than 800 distinct mutations in the CFTR gene have been associated with clinical diseases characteristic of cystic fibrosis (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Whereas many organs are affected in CF, morbidity and mortality in the disease is primarily related to mucus accumulation, recurrent infections, and excessive inflammation in the lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Whereas the pathogenesis of CF is not fully understood, abnormalities in cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion and excessive sodium reuptake by epithelial cells related to CFTR deficiency are thought to alter fluid homeostasis at the airway surface liquid leading to its dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance, and infection (see Ref.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Because the elucidation of the primary structure of CFTR, a myriad of functions and numerous interactions with other cellular proteins have been ascribed to CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, in addition to the role of CFTR in the regulation of cAMP-dependent chloride transport, this protein may play pleotropic roles in many cellular processes by interacting with the cytoskeleton, membrane transport proteins, as well as receptors, protein routing and degradation machinery (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A number of studies support the concept that the excessive inflammatory responses occur in the CF lung, but the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities have not been clarified.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Changes in levels of IL-8 and other proteins mediating inflammatory signaling including NFB and iNOS have been associated with CF, in the presence or absence of infection, raising the possibility that abnormalities in CFTR may constitutively alter pathways mediating inflammation (4-6).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	21	In the lung, CFTR is distributed primarily in apical regions of airway and submucosal gland epithelial cells (7).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Abundance and cellular sites of expression of CFTR are strongly influenced by developmental, spatial, and humoral factors, supporting the concept that the expression and function of CFTR are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Despite extensive study, the precise role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of CF disease remains poorly understood.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	24	 At the clinical level, severity of CF disease is highly variable even among individuals bearing identical mutations, supporting the concept that environmental and hereditary factors may influence the severity of the disorder (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These clinical observations, and observations demonstrating strain differences in the severity of CF phenotype after CFTR gene targeting or mutation in mice (8), support the concept that the expression of CFTR and its function in cellular processes may be influenced by many genes or pathways intensifying or mollifying CF disease in various organs.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Morbidity and mortality in patients with CF is strongly associated with pulmonary disease caused by mucous accumulation, inflammation, and infection; however, deletion of CFTR mice does not cause significant pulmonary disease suggesting that expression of alternative channels or other complementary genes maintains pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Whereas numerous in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for study of CFTR, analysis of genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR are complicated by heterogeneity of cell models, and culture conditions that may influence cell function and gene expression independently of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Direct RNA analysis of pulmonary tissue from humans with CF is complicated by the nearly ubiquitous, severe pulmonary infections that may secondarily modify cellular responses and gene expression, complicating identification of responses to CFTR in vivo.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	29	In the present study, we undertook experiments to identify RNAs influenced by the presence and absence of CFTR in vivo, seeking to identify genes and pathways that interact with or compensate for the CFTR to maintain pulmonary function.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In this study, stereotypic genomic responses to the lack of CFTR were observed in pulmonary tissues in the absence of infection or disease.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	32	Transgenic mice bearing a null mutation in CFTR (CFTR()), generally succumb to intestinal disease in the weanling period (9).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To generate healthy mice deficient in CFTR, the human CFTR cDNA was expressed in the intestinal epithelium under control of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein gene promoter (iFABP), fully correcting small intestinal pathology and supporting normal postnatal survival of CFTR() mice (10).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The iFABP-hCFTR, mCFTR() mice have been maintained in a mixed FVB/N, C57BL/6 background without evidence of gastrointestinal or pulmonary disease for nearly a decade in our laboratory.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To minimize the potential influence of strain differences in this colony, lung RNA was isolated from sex-matched littermates at 3, 6, and 11 weeks of age.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	42	 RNA was also isolated from lungs of surviving CFTR()/hCFTR() and CFTR(+) littermates at 3 weeks of age for comparison with those bearing the iFABP-hCFTR transgene.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	168	The absence of CFTR caused stereotypic changes in gene expression in the lungs of CFTR() mice in the absence of detectable infection or inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Cellular responses to CFTR included enhanced expression of transcription factors and signaling pathways known to influence CFTR gene expression (IL-1 and CEBP).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Likewise, expression of RNAs modulating inflammation, ion transport, protein trafficking, and degradation were altered, indicating that a number of cellular pathways may compensate for or mediate CFTR-dependent functions that, in turn, may maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the CFTR() mice or alternatively, influence CF phenotype following response to pathogens.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The absence of CFTR initiates reproducible changes in lung gene expression that may modify inflammation, host defense, and other cellular functions, that likely contribute to or mollify the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease in CF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	172	Because strain is known to influence pulmonary findings in CF mice (8), and the transgenic mice presently studied were generated in a mixed FVB/N, C57 Bl/6 background, lung RNA was compared from sex-matched littermates at various ages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	173	 An extensive data set was utilized to identify CFTR-dependent changes in gene expression that were present throughout development and in the absence of inflammation, seeking to identify pathways influenced primarily by CFTR, rather than sex, strain, age, or other secondary phenomena.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	174	 As expected, expression of mCFTR was not detected in the gastrointestinal-corrected mCFTR() mice, consistent with previous findings (10).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Histologic analyses, performed presently and previously, demonstrated no structural abnormalities, infection or inflammation in the lungs of these mice as maintained in our vivarium (10, 11), supporting the concept that changes in gene expression were related to CFTR and not to age or lung disease.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Analysis of arrays prepared from pairs of mCFTR() mice and mCFTR(+) littermates (those lacking the iFABP-hCFTR transgene), confirmed the microarray findings, demonstrating both the lack of mCFTR mRNA in lungs of the mCFTR() and that RNA changes were independent of the iFABP-hCFTR transgene.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	177	Expression of Genes Modulating CFTR-- Expression of a number of genes known to influence CFTR expression was enhanced in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including CEBP and IL-1 suggesting that CFTR cells responded by enhancing levels of RNAs encoding transcription factors or pathways that may compensate for the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	178	 IL-1 increased CFTR gene transcription in epithelial cells in vitro (15) and cis-acting elements binding CEBP (to CCAAT enhancer sites) and c-Fos (to AP-1 elements) are present in the promoter-enhancer regions of the mouse CFTR gene (16, 17).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Previous studies demonstrated that CEBP directly enhanced CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18), thus, the increased CEBP expression may represent a potential compensatory response to CFTR deficiency that, in turn, may influence expression of genes unrelated to CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Expression of c-fos was also increased in the mCFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Whereas AP-1 sites have been identified in the hCFTR promoter, the precise role of c-fos in regulation of CFTR has not been clarified; although treatment of various cell types with phorbol esters decreased CFTR gene transcription in vitro (18).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Because CEBP and c-fos activate or inhibit the expression of numerous genes that share cis-active elements with the CFTR gene, changes in their activity may broadly influence gene expression, perhaps inadvertently linking CFTR deficiency to the expression of genes whose activities are not directly related to CFTR protein function.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	183	 RNA encoding TNF-AIP-3, a zinc finger transcription factor, was also increased in the CFTR() mice, further linking transcription responses to the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Of considerable interest, TNF-AIP-3 RNA was induced by either IL-1 or TNF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	185	 TNF-AIP-3 inhibited NFB translocation in vitro, and may represent a compensatory response to the increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice (19).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	186	 JAK-3, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, and interferon regulatory factor-1 RNAs were decreased in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These RNAs encode transcription factors that regulate various pathways involved in inflammation and may, therefore, represent responses to the proinflammatory proteins induced in the CFTR() mice, in essence, being secondarily responsive to initial compensatory changes.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	188	Enhanced Expression of Genes Modulating Inflammation-- Genes involved in inflammation were overly represented among the RNAs induced and were distinct from those that were decreased in the lungs from CFTR() mice (Table III).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Most prominent among genes whose expression was increased were a family of calcium-binding proteins termed the calgranulins (S100A8, S100A9, and calbindin D9K).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	190	 S100A8 is expressed primarily by macrophages and monocytes and its expression is enhanced by various cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, and interferon  (20, 21).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This family of peptides is expressed by various cell types and share potent chemoattractant activities, stimulating inflammatory cell trafficking.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Increased expression of S100A8 (calgranulin A) was previously demonstrated in alveolar macrophages from CFTR mutant mice, the authors suggesting that increased S100A8 may contribute to the enhanced inflammatory responses seen in the absence of CFTR (22).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Expression of S100A8 by alveolar macrophages was induced by TNF-, interferon  and IL-1, mediated at least in part by AP-1-dependent pathways (20).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Chitinase A mRNA was also consistently increased in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The acidic chitinase A is a small peptide containing a mammalian lectin domain that binds complex carbohydrates on surfaces of microbial pathogens including fungi.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Like the S100 family of proteins, chitinase family members are also expressed by alveolar macrophages in the lung (23).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Thus, decreased mCFTR initiated changes in expression of gene expressed primarily in alveolar macrophages.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	198	 It remains unclear whether these responses are mediated by direct effects of CFTR in alveolar macrophages or by altered cellular signaling initiated by the lack of CFTR in epithelial or other pulmonary cells that secondarily alters macrophage activity.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	199	Intense neutrophilic infiltration and an increased IL-8 production are strongly associated with CF lung disease in humans (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Increased IL-8 and neutrophilic infiltrates were observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CF patients in the absence of documented pulmonary infection (4).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Although it remains possible that antecedent, but resolved, infections may have contributed to the increased inflammation observed in the CF, these observations support the concept that CF is associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In the present study, IL-1, IL-4, and CSF-1 receptor RNAs were increased and each may contribute to the proinflammatory milieu.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	203	 IL-1 enhances CFTR gene transcription, induces inflammation, and is known to stimulate production of the S100-calgranulins, perhaps indicating a network of genes influenced by CFTR through IL-1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	204	 IL-4 is a potent inflammatory mediator that enhances inflammation and mucous production in airway epithelia.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Transgenic animals expressing IL-4 or animal models in which IL-4 is induced developed severe goblet cell hyperplasia, increased mucous production, and inflammatory cell infiltrates (24), findings typically found in patients with cystic fibrosis.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	206	 CSF-3r RNA encoding a receptor that mediates monocytic cell migration, proliferation, and activity in response to CSF-3 (G-CSF) was increased 3-4-fold in the CFTR() mice (25).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus, taken together, expression of a number of genes; many influenced by IL-1 and mediating inflammation, were induced in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	208	Despite the increased expression of proinflammatory molecules, there is no evidence of inflammation in the lung of the CFTR() mice perhaps indicating that normal homeostasis is maintained by the complex responses of the lung to the lack of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The presence of stereotypic changes in expression of many genes suggests that the presence of a single ameliorating gene, for example, an alternative chloride channel, does not fully explain the physiologic adjustment of the lung the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	210	 At present, it is unclear whether these proinflammatory responses are secondary to changes in the expression and function of CFTR in the epithelial cells that, in turn, modulate cell signaling and cytokine production in the lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Alternatively, the absence of CFTR in the alveolar macrophages may alter expression of genes mediating inflammation in those cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	212	 It is of considerable interest that changes in RNAs modifying inflammation were altered in the lungs of mCFTR() mice in the absence of detectable bacterial infection or inflammation, supporting the concept that the transcriptional adjustment to CFTR deficiency suffices to maintain normal pulmonary homeostasis in the mouse in vivo.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Alternatively, the levels of expression of the proinflammatory molecules may not be adequate to cause histologically detectable inflammation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	214	 It remains unclear whether these adjustments in gene expression may, in turn, render the CFTR() mice susceptible to inflammation following infection or injury.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	215	Changes in NFB- and TNF--dependent Pathways-- RNAs encoding a number of proteins involved in TNF signaling and NFB activation were also induced in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The abundance of TNF-AIP-3 mRNA, a zinc finger transcription protein, a protein whose expression is induced by both TNF- and IL-1, was increased in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	217	 TNF-AIP-3 inhibits NFB activity at target genes (19) and may represent a response to the proinflammatory milieu established in the CFTR() lung.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	218	 PEG-3, a protein that regulates the induction of NFB following TNF stimulation, was also increased, providing for the support for transcriptional relationships between CFTR deficiency and activity of NFB (26).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Recent studies of Schroeder et al.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	220	 (27) support the concept that the CFTR is required for regulation of NFB, serving as a pattern-associated molecular recognition molecule, following pulmonary exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In that study, NFB activation and its nuclear trafficking were deficient in CF cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Taken together with the observation that IL-1-mediated transcription of CFTR gene transcription is dependent upon NFB, this important pathway mediating inflammation appears to be influenced by CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	223	In the present microarray analysis, CFTR deficiency was associated with increased claudin 8 and decreased gap junction connexin 37.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Decreased expression of gap junction proteins (Cx43, 40, -37, and -32) and decreased gap junction communication were observed in various in vitro cell systems after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (28).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The observed changes in RNAs mediating cell adhesion and increased expression of IL-1 seen in the CFTR() mice are consistent with findings that in the absence of CFTR, IL-1 and TNF- failed to inhibit cell communication via gap junctions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Previous studies demonstrated that CFTR is required for the uncoupling of gap functions between epithelial cells during inflammation, a process that may restrict the spread of pathogens or signaling among adjacent cells.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	227	 It will be of interest to test whether cell adhesion mediated by the claudins is also linked to the pathogenesis of CF.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	228	Changes in Protein Degradation Pathways-- Several genes involved in protein degradation were altered in the absence of CFTR compared with normal.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Proteosome 26 S subunit (PSMC3) is the major proteolytic component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Proteosome 26 S regulates degradation of proteins influencing cell cycle, oncogenesis, transcription, and immunity, including CFTR itself (29, 30).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The proteosome is composed of two subcomplexes, the 20 S proteosome and PA700.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	232	 PSMC3 expression was modestly, but significantly increased (1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In contrast, PA28 (PSME3), an activator of the 20 S proteosome, was decreased 1.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	234	 These observations are consistent with previous findings that proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF- or interferon- increased expression of the 26 S proteosome and its activators PA28  and  (31), whereas expression of PA28  was decreased by interferon- (32).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	235	 RNA encoding adaptor protein complex AP-2, 1 subunit (Ap2a1), a protein involved in the formation of intracellular transport vesicles was also decreased in the absence of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	236	 CFTR co-precipitates with -adaptin (33).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Recent studies demonstrated that a C-terminal domain of CFTR binds to the AP-2 adaptor complex to form clathrin-coated vesicles that mediates CFTR internalization (34).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	238	 ADP-ribosylation factor 5 belongs to a family of GTP-binding proteins that play important roles in the control of membrane trafficking, including formation of secretory vesicles at the trans-Golgi network, endosomal and vesicle-plasma membrane fusion (35).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Recent studies support the concept that CFTR regulates endosomal fusion and vesicular trafficking (36, 37) indicating potential relationships between CFTR and the actions of ADP-ribosylation factor 5.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Another gene in this functional category is represented by kinesin3, an mRNA that was decreased in the lungs of CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	241	Transport Proteins Influenced by CFTR-- RNAs encoding several transmembrane transport proteins and receptors were also altered in the lungs of CFTR() mice, including solute carrier 38 (member 4), the potassium inwardly rectifying channel (Kir 4.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	242	2 or Kcnj 15), the glutamate receptor (Grin 2d), the naturietic peptide receptor 3 (Npr-3), and the 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB-3).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Thus, expression of a number of membrane transport proteins was influenced by CFTR, perhaps representing compensatory responses to defects in CFTR-mediated transport activity.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	244	2 and Grin 2d RNAs were increased 2-3-fold in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	245	2 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells at sites similar to that of CFTR (38).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	246	2 regulates cation transport upon which chloride transport via CFTR or other chloride channels may be influenced.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Surprisingly, there is evidence for interactions between CFTR and Kir family members because they are both known to bind via PDZ binding domains through interactions with channel interacting PDZ domain protein (39).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Likewise, there is precedence for PDZ-dependent interactions among glutamate receptors, CFTR, and Kir family members (40).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Thus, the lack of CFTR enhanced the expression of a number of membrane proteins that may interact with CFTR via PDZ domains, perhaps indicating that CFTR-protein complexes may initiate changes in gene expression.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These findings support the concept that CFTR interacts with numerous membrane transport proteins and do not support a model in which activity of an alternative Cl transporter alone suffices to compensate for the lack of CFTR in pulmonary cells in the CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	251	Regulation of Cell Receptors by CFTR-- Natriuretic peptide receptor C (Npr-3 or NprC) was increased more than 2-fold in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Natriuretic peptides comprise a family of 3 structurally related molecules: atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) whose functions are cGMP-dependent (41, 42).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Among them, CNP increased ciliary beat, mucociliary clearance in airway epithelial cells, and activated CFTR-dependent chloride transport (42).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Natriuretic peptides regulate cytokine-stimulated NO production via the binding of Npr-3 (43).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Because deficient NO production was observed in respiratory epithelial cells of the iFABP-hCFTR, CFTR() mice, the increased expression of Npr-3 in CFTR() mice may represent a compensatory response influencing airway clearance and nitric oxide production via cGMP (44).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In contrast to the transport/receptors that were induced, ADRB3, a G protein-coupled transmembrane protein mediating cAMP production was decreased in CFTR() mice.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	257	 ADRB3 is co-expressed with CFTR in airway epithelium (45) and may be functionally coupled to CFTR via cAMP-independent pathways (46).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	258	 2-Adrenergic receptors directly interact with CFTR via the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor to form a signal transduction complex (47).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Co-regulation of ADRB3 and CFTR may indicate that these proteins interact closely at both structural and functional levels, a finding that may be linked to the important role of -adrenergic stimulation and cAMP in the activation of chloride transport mediated by CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	260	Altered Expression of RNAs Encoding CFTR Interacting Proteins-- Surprisingly, analysis of the RNA influenced by CFTR identified a number of proteins that directly or indirectly interact with CFTR via protein-protein interactions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This list included proteins involved in protein trafficking and degradation (proteosome 26 S and PA28 subunits and -adaptin), ion transport (Kcnj15 and Grin 2d), and receptors (Npr-3 and ADRB3).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Interaction of CFTR with many proteins occurs via PDZ binding domains that mediate protein-protein complex formation.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The finding that expression of CFTR interacting proteins is altered in the lungs of CFTR() mice, suggests that CFTR influences networks of signaling and transport activities in the cell and that cells respond to CFTR deficiency via transcriptional responses to CFTR-protein complexes, rather than to CFTR per se.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	264	Are Changes in Gene Expression Bystander Effects?-- Whereas genomic responses may compensate for the lack of CFTR mRNA and represent compensation for CFTR function, some responses may be secondary and mediated by pathways not directly related to the action of CFTR per se.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Alterations in cytokine production or changes in transcription factor activity caused by the absence of CFTR may secondarily change the behavior of numerous cell types, that may, in turn, contribute to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease by processes that are not direct functions of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Because CFTR is known to form a membrane-associated cyclic nucleotide-activated Cl channel and interacts with numerous other cellular proteins, changes in gene expression may indicate that cells sense the CFTR protein, CFTR-dependent activity, or CFTR-protein complexes that initiate transcriptional responses related to or unrelated to CFTR function.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	267	 At present, it is unclear whether the "sensor" is chloride ion, the presence of CFTR, or CFTR-protein complexes in intracellular and membrane compartments or to other functions of CFTR.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Likewise, the hierarchy and interrelatedness of the networks of RNA responses to CFTR deficiency remain to be unraveled.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	269	Maintenance of pulmonary homeostasis in the mCFTR() mouse was associated with complex adaptive responses in gene expression.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	270	 CFTR influenced RNAs encoding transcription factors, ion channels, membrane receptors, cytokines, and intracellular trafficking proteins.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Finally, CFTR altered the expression of a number of proteins that interact with CFTR via protein-protein interactions perhaps representing transcriptional responses to functions mediated by CFTR() protein complexes (Fig.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The diversity of genes whose expression was altered by CFTR support the concept that, in addition to regulation of Cl transport, CFTR plays diverse roles in multiple cellular functions.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The present findings support the hypothesis that pulmonary homeostasis in the CFTR() mouse is maintained by complex genomic responses to the lack of CFTR rather than by the action of a single alternative Cl channel.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Finally, the genes and pathways identified in this study provide new links between CFTR and cellular processes that may influence the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.

0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	277	 A model is proposed by which the lack of CFTR initiates expression of genes that are known to enhance CFTR expression IL-1 and CEBP, secondarily modulating inflammation (1, 2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Increased expression of cytokines, IL-4 and IL-1, and the cytokine receptor, CSF-3R, may influence inflammation (2) as well as expression of genes modulating protein trafficking, degradation, and cell-cell communication (3-5).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Abundance of RNA of chemoattractant peptides of the calgranulin family were enhanced, perhaps contributing to a proinflammatory environment within the lung (2).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	280	 CFTR altered the expression of RNAs encoding transport proteins and membrane receptors that likely interact with CFTR via PDZ domains (6, 7) supporting the concept that pulmonary cells respond to the lack of CFTR or CFTR complexes by regulating the expression of CFTR partners.
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Alterations in pathways regulating second messengers, including cAMP, via the 3-adrenergic receptor (Adrb3), were observed (7).
0.44193757.12482874.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Absence of CFTR also influenced expression of genes mediating endocytosis, membrane recycling, and regulated secretion (4, 8, 9).

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To investigate the mechanism of inward rectification, we studied CFTR Cl- channels in excised inside-out membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type human and murine CFTR using voltage-ramp and -step protocols.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Using a voltage-ramp protocol, the magnitude of human CFTR Cl- current at +100 mV was 74  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- current was reproduced in full by ensemble currents generated by averaging single-channel currents elicited by an identical voltage-ramp protocol.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, using a voltage-step protocol the single-channel current amplitude (i) of human CFTR at +100 mV was 88  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of that at -100 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Based on these data, we hypothesized that voltage might alter the gating behavior of human CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Using linear three-state kinetic schemes, we demonstrated that voltage has marked effects on channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, voltage was without large effect on the open probability (Po) of human CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In contrast, the Po of murine CFTR was decreased markedly at positive voltages, suggesting that the rectification of murine CFTR is stronger than that of human CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We conclude that inward rectification of CFTR is caused by a reduction in i and changes in gating kinetics.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We suggest that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel and not the result of pore block.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	17	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; Riordan et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	18	, 1989) is a phosphorylation-regulated Cl- channel that plays a central role in transepithelial fluid and electrolyte transport (Gadsby and Nairn, 1999; Sheppard and Welsh, 1999).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The characteristic behavior of CFTR is determined by the function of the different domains from which CFTR is assembled.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These include the two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) that are each composed of six transmembrane segments, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that each contain motifs which interact with ATP, and the unique R (regulatory) domain that contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites and many charged amino acids.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The MSDs assemble to form the Cl--selective pore while the NBDs and R domain control CFTR channel gating (Gadsby and Nairn, 1999; Sheppard and Welsh, 1999).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	22	In cell-attached membrane patch recordings, the single-channel current-voltage (I-V) relationship of CFTR outwardly rectifies (Berger et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	23	 (1991) attributed this outward rectification to Goldman-type rectification caused by the Cl- concentration gradient.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, subsequent studies have offered alternative explanations.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	25	 (1993) proposed that rectification is a function of the concentration and permeability of anions within the cell.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Second, Fischer and Machen (1994) attributed rectification to high frequency gating of the CFTR Cl- channel at negative voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Third, studies by a number of investigators have demonstrated that large anions cause a voltage-dependent block of the CFTR Cl- channel when they are present in the intracellular solution (McDonough et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 1994; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These anions bind within a deep wide vestibule at the intracellular end of the CFTR pore to prevent Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	30	 This block of the CFTR Cl- channel by large intracellular anions is reminiscent of the effect of intracellular cations on inward-rectifier K+ channels (Kir channels; Hille, 2001).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Inward rectification of these K+ channels is caused by voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ and polyamines found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, as first proposed by Tabcharani et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	33	 (1991), the outward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels observed in cell-attached membrane patches is likely caused by voltage-dependent block by large anions found in the cytoplasm of the cell (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a, 1999).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	34	When inside-out membrane patches excised from cells expressing wild-type human CFTR are bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions, the single-channel I-V relationship of CFTR is linear (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, we previously observed inward rectification of wild-type CFTR Cl- currents in excised membrane patches from C127 cells expressing wild-type human CFTR (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	36	, 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	37	 At negative voltages, the I-V relationship was linear, whereas at positive voltages, the I-V relationship exhibited inward rectification that was most marked at voltages above +50 mV (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	38	, 2000; Cai and Sheppard, 2002).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Using excised membrane patches from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing wild-type human CFTR, Linsdell and colleagues observed similar results in some studies (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1999; Linsdell and Gong, 2002), but not in others (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	40	, 1998; Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	41	 (1996) reported inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In this study, we investigate the mechanism of inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We employ voltage-ramp and -step protocols to study macroscopic and single-channel currents in excised inside-out membrane patches from cells expressing wild-type human and murine CFTR and kinetic modeling to analyze channel gating.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The intracellular solution was maintained at 37 degrees C using a temperature-controlled microscope stage (Brook Industries).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	59	After excision of inside-out membrane patches, we added the catalytic subunit of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) to the intracellular solution within 5 min of patch excision to activate CFTR Cl- channels.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	60	 To prevent the rundown of CFTR Cl- channels in excised membrane patches, we added PKA to all intracellular solutions.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Unless otherwise indicated, membrane patches were voltage-clamped at -50 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	62	To investigate the voltage dependence of CFTR, we used either membrane patches containing large numbers of active channels or membrane patches containing five or less active channels.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The number of channels in a membrane patch was determined from the maximum number of simultaneous channel openings observed during the course of an experiment, as previously described (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Using multichannel patches, we generated macroscopic I-V relationships by averaging currents generated by 15 to 30 ramps of voltage each of 2-s duration; holding voltage was -50 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Basal currents with no active CFTR Cl- channels recorded in the absence of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) were subtracted from those recorded in the presence of PKA and ATP to generate the I-V relationship of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	66	 To generate ensemble currents, we applied the same voltage protocol used with multichannel patches to membrane patches containing five or less active channels 50 to 100 times.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	67	 We subtracted basal currents recorded in the absence of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) from currents recorded in the presence of PKA and ATP before averaging subtracted currents to generate the ensemble current.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	68	 For single-channel studies of the voltage dependence of CFTR, voltage was stepped from -100 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments of 30 to 60 s duration.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Alternatively, voltage was clamped at a single voltage for 2 to 4-min periods to acquire sufficient data for analyses of gating kinetics.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	70	CFTR Cl- currents were initially recorded on digital audiotape using a digital tape recorder (model DTR-1204, Biologic Scientific Instruments; Intracel Ltd.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	83	 To determine which component function fitted best, the log-likelihood ratio test was used and considered statistically significant at a value of 2.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Burst analysis was performed as described by Carson et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	85	 (1995a), using a burst delimiter (tc; the time that separates interburst closures from intraburst closures) determined by analyses of closed time histograms (Fig.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Closures longer than tc were considered to define interburst closures, whereas closures shorter than this time were considered gaps within bursts.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Mean burst duration (TMBD) and open probability within a burst (Po(burst)) were determined directly from experimental data using pCLAMP software.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	90	 TMBD was determined from histograms of burst duration data plotted with logarithmic x-axes with 10 bins decade-1, Po(burst) was calculated using burst duration and closed times within bursts data, and Po was calculated as described previously (Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Only membrane patches that contained a single active channel were used for single-channel kinetic analyses.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	92	Modeling of Single-channel Kinetics To perform maximum likelihood analysis and develop kinetic models of CFTR channel gating, we used the QuB software suite (www.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In brief, digitized current records generated by pCLAMP software were imported with no further filtering and baseline corrected (program PRE).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Using a recursive Viterbi algorithm (program SKM), idealized currents were produced.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Finally, rate constants for kinetic models were calculated from the idealized current dwell time sequence using a maximum likelihood approach (program MIL).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	97	 For consistency with analyses using pCLAMP software, transitions  < 1 ms were excluded.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	98	To investigate the voltage dependence of rate constants, we first calculated rate constants at equivalent positive and negative voltages from individual membrane patches.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	99	 If rate constants are voltage dependent, the relationship between rate constant and voltage is described by the single exponential function:.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	100	(2)where k is the unknown rate constant, k0 is the rate constant at unitary ligand concentration and zero voltage, P is the ligand concentration, and V is voltage.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	122	 To identify the membrane currents generated by CFTR, we subtracted the membrane currents recorded under basal conditions from those recorded following the addition of PKA (75 nM) and ATP (1 mM) to the intracellular solution.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	124	 At negative voltages, the I-V relationship is linear, whereas at positive voltages, the I-V relationship exhibits weak inward rectification (Fig.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	144	 We reasoned that if the I-V relationship of individual CFTR Cl- channels exhibits inward rectification, summation of single-channel currents should reproduce the rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	145	 To test this hypothesis, we applied the same voltage protocol used to study macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents to membrane patches containing five or less active channels.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Visual inspection of these single-channel records suggests that current amplitude at negative voltages is larger than that at positive voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Consistent with this idea, the ensemble current generated by averaging the single-channel currents elicited by 70 voltage ramps inwardly rectifies (Fig.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	163	 To discriminate between these different possibilities, we investigated the effect of voltage on the single-channel activity of CFTR.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	192	 For example, at +100 mV single-channel current amplitude (i) = 88  plus or minus  2% of that at -100 mV (n = 10), whereas at +100 mV macroscopic current (I) = 74  plus or minus  2% of that at -100 mV (n = 10; P  <  0.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	195	 At negative voltages the gating behavior of CFTR was characterized by bursts of channel activity, interrupted by brief flickery closures, separated by longer closures between bursts (Fig.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These data suggest that voltage alters the gating behavior of the CFTR Cl- channel without noticeably changing Po.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	225	Thus, our data suggest that the single-channel behavior of CFTR accounts for the rectification of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	226	 CFTR Cl- current is determined by the product of the number of CFTR Cl- channels in the membrane patch (N), the single-channel current amplitude (i), and the probability (Po) that a single channel is open: ICFTR = N x i x Po.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	227	 If we set each of these variables to 100% for the -100 mV data, we can compare the CFTR Cl- current generated at -100 and +100 mV.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	303	 We attribute this subtle effect of voltage on Po to the changes in mean burst duration and interburst interval counterbalancing each other.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	304	To understand better the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, we calculated rate constants for both kinetic schemes at -50, -20, +20, and +50 mV and fitted the data using the single exponential function k=k0Pexp (Eq.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	323	 We were especially interested in the effects of PPi on the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating, because PPi abolished the asymmetric permeability of CFTR to large organic anions (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	378	 For example, the inward rectification of Kir channels, NMDA receptors, and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels is caused by voltage-dependent block of outward current flow by extrinsic cations.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	379	 In the case of Kir channels the blocking cations are intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines (Vandenberg, 1987; Lopatin et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	380	, 1994), whereas for NMDA receptors and cyclic nucleotide to gated channels the blocking cations are extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Nowak et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	381	, 1984; Zimmerman and Baylor, 1986).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	382	 In contrast, inward rectification of KAT1, an inward-rectifier K+ channel from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, results from an intrinsic gating mechanism (Zei and Aldrich, 1998).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Like voltage-gated K+ channels (Hille, 2001), KAT1 possesses a voltage-sensor, the S4 segment that uses the energy of voltage to control channel gating (Zei and Aldrich, 1998).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	384	Several lines of evidence suggest that channel block is not likely to account for inward rectification of the CFTR Cl- channel in excised inside-out membrane patches.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	385	 First, changes in the composition of the intra- and extracellular solutions did not abolish inward rectification (for data and discussion, see the online supplemental material, available at http://www.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Second, inward rectification has been observed using cells expressing either native or recombinant wild-type human CFTR (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	387	, Quinton and Reddy, 2000; Lansdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	388	, 2000; Linsdell and Gong, 2002; this study), indicating that inward rectification is independent of the expression system used to investigate CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Third, inward rectification of CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers was unaffected by changes in the composition of the lipid bilayer (Zhao et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	390	, 1996), suggesting that the surface charge of the membrane lipid does not affect inward rectification.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Fourth, the effects of voltage on the function of the murine CFTR Cl- channel (present study) indicate that inward rectification is a common characteristic of human and murine CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Fifth, mutation of several residues within the MSDs alters the shape of the I-V relationship of CFTR.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents is accentuated by mutation of R334, T338, T339, and S341 (sixth transmembrane segment (M6); Gong and Linsdell, 2003; Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	394	, 2002), S1118 (M11; Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	395	, 2000), and T1134 and N1138 (M12; Gupta et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	396	 In contrast, mutation of V317 (M5; Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	397	, 2002) causes outward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Based on these data, we speculate that inward rectification is an intrinsic property of the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Because ADP and PPi, two agents that interact with the NBDs, are without effect on inward rectification and because site-directed mutations in the MSDs enhance inward rectification, we propose that the CFTR pore determines this property of the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	400	For the CFTR pore, itself, to be responsible for inward rectification, the architecture of the pore should facilitate the flow of Cl- from the intra- to the extracellular side of the membrane, but hinder Cl- flow in the opposite direction.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	401	 To transport ions at maximal translocation rates, ion channels have evolved charged lined vestibules that concentrate and funnel ions toward the selectivity filter (Green and Andersen, 1991; Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Based on these considerations, inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR pore might be achieved by asymmetries in the geometry of the intra- and extracellular vestibules, differences in the distribution of Cl--binding sites between the two vestibules or a combination of these factors.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	403	Evidence for asymmetries in the topology of the intra- and extracellular vestibules is provided by studies of anion permeation and channel block.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Anion permeation studies indicate that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore is 0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	405	60 nm in diameter (Cheung and Akabas, 1996; Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	406	, 1997), widening under certain circumstances to a diameter of 1.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	407	3 nm (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	408	 This constriction, which likely represents the selectivity filter, occurs in the region of F337 and T338 in M6 because mutation of these residues altered dramatically the anion permeability sequence of CFTR, whereas mutation of other residues in M6 had less marked effects on anion permeation (Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	409	, 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	410	, 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	411	 On the intra- and extracellular sides of this constriction, the pore enlarges.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	412	 The voltage dependence of channel block by large organic anions suggests that the CFTR pore contains a wide intracellular vestibule that funnels blocking anions deep into the pore where they bind, occlude the pore, and block Cl- permeation (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1996; Sheppard and Robinson, 1997; Hwang and Sheppard, 1999; Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Less is known about the topology of the extracellular end of the CFTR pore.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	414	 Based on the ability of methanethiosulphonate reagents in the extracellular solution to react with M6 residues toward the cytosolic side of the membrane (Cheung and Akabas, 1996), there might also be a wide extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	415	 However, the inability of open-channel blockers to reach their binding sites when added to the extracellular solution and the short length of extracellular loops 3 and 6 led McCarty (2000) to propose that CFTR has a small extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Consistent with this idea, Linsdell and Hanrahan (1998a)(b) demonstrated that CFTR exhibits an asymmetric permeability to large organic anions (e.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	417	, galacturonate, glutathione, and lactobionate).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	418	 During the normal gating cycle, flow of large organic anions through the CFTR pore is only permitted in the intra- to extracellular direction (Linsdell and Hanrahan, 1998a,b).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	419	The sixth transmembrane segment plays a crucial role in determining the pore properties of CFTR (Sheppard and Welsh, 1999; McCarty, 2000; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Within M6, the residues R334 (Smith et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	421	, 2001; Gong and Linsdell, 2003), K335 (Anderson et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	422	, 2002), and possibly R352 (Guinamard and Akabas, 1999; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	423	, 2002) contribute to Cl--binding sites.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Assuming that the narrowest part of the CFTR pore occurs in the region of F337 and T338 (see above and Linsdell et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	425	, 1998, 2000; McCarty and Zhang, 2001; Gong et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	426	, 2002; Gupta and Linsdell, 2003), the data suggest that three Cl--binding sites (S341, I344, and R352) might be located in a spacious intracellular vestibule, whereas two Cl--binding sites (R334 and K335) might be located in a more confined extracellular vestibule.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	427	 This simple model suggests that current flow through the CFTR pore might inwardly rectify.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	428	 However, an important caveat of this model is that present knowledge of the mechanism of anion permeation by the CFTR Cl- channel is incomplete and it is quite likely that residues in other transmembrane segments contribute to Cl--binding sites.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Nevertheless, asymmetries in the size of the intra- and extracellular vestibules and/or the distribution of Cl--binding sites within the CFTR pore are plausible explanations for the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	430	Besides the architecture of the CFTR pore, voltage-dependent gating might make some contribution to the observed inward rectification of current flow through the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Work by other investigators and ourselves demonstrate that CFTR channel gating exhibits voltage dependence despite the lack of a marked effect of voltage on Po.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	432	 First, using cell-attached membrane patches from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing wild-type human CFTR, Fischer and Machen (1994) demonstrated that slow (ATP dependent) gating is voltage independent, whereas fast (flickery intraburst) gating is voltage dependent, becoming the dominant gating mode at strong negative voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Second, using excised membrane patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type human CFTR, Zhang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	434	 (2002) demonstrated that burst duration increases at negative voltages, whereas interburst interval is unaffected by voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	435	 Third, to investigate the flickery closures that interrupt bursts of channel openings, Zhou et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	436	 (2001) analyzed the gating kinetics of the CFTR variant K1250A whose prolonged openings facilitate the discrimination of fast and slow gating events.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	437	 (2001) found that the rate of transition from the short-lived closed state to the open state exhibits voltage dependence and is sensitive to permeant anions in the extracellular solution, suggesting that brief flickery closures represent the voltage-dependent occupancy of an anion-binding site within the CFTR pore by unknown intracellular anions.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	438	To elucidate the effects of voltage on CFTR channel gating, we adopted a different strategy to other investigators.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	439	 We employed kinetic modeling to analyze the gating behavior of single wild-type human CFTR Cl- channels in excised membrane patches bathed in symmetrical Cl--rich solutions at 37 degrees C and lightly filtered our data.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Using this approach, we determined the effect of voltage on both fast and slow gating events.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	441	 Our data indicate that voltage has significant effects on CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	442	 Membrane depolarization decreased both the duration of bursts and the interburst interval, but increased the duration of gaps within bursts.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	443	 However, because the voltage dependencies of the different rate constants were in opposite directions, Po was largely unaffected by voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	444	 The voltage independence of Po and the lack of effect of ADP and PPi on the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- currents argue that changes in CFTR channel gating do not contribute to the rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	445	 However, other data suggest the contrary.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	446	 First, the predicted CFTR Cl- current (N x i x Po) at +100 mV, which is accounted for by reductions in both i and Po, agrees closely with the measured CFTR Cl- current at this voltage.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	447	 Second, the Po of murine CFTR is decreased markedly at positive voltages.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Third, comparison of the data of Smith et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	449	 (2001) and Gong and Linsdell (2003) suggests that the strong inward rectification of the CFTR variant R334C is not accounted for by voltage-dependent changes in i.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	450	 Based on these data, we argue that voltage-dependent changes in CFTR channel gating contribute to the inward rectification of macroscopic CFTR Cl- currents.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	451	Our data indicate that the total equivalent gating charge for CFTR is only 0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	452	 The small size of the gating charge of CFTR is consistent with the lack of marked voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	453	 The data suggest that residues with charged and uncharged polar side chains move only a very small distance within the transmembrane electric field.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	454	 These residues might be located either along the full-length of the CFTR pore or restricted to a specific region of the permeation pathway.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	455	 Alternatively, linear three-state kinetic schemes might be too simple to describe the voltage dependence of CFTR channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Because the total equivalent gating charge of CFTR is comparable to the amount of charge movement intrinsic to the voltage-dependent Cl- channel ClC-0 (Chen and Miller, 1996), we favor the former idea.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	457	 The amino acid sequence of ClC-0 lacks a motif equivalent to the S4 segment, the voltage sensor of voltage-gated cation channels (Hille, 2001).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	458	 Instead, permeant anions in the extracellular solution act as the source of the gating charge (Pusch et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	459	 The binding of Cl- ions to a Cl--binding site located at the extracellular end of the ClC-0 pore causes a conformational change that precedes channel opening and inward Cl- flow (Chen and Miller, 1996).
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	460	 Because bound Cl- ions traverse the transmembrane electric field, gating is both voltage and Cl- concentration dependent (Pusch et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Excitingly, the structural basis of this gating mechanism has been elucidated following the determination of high-resolution crystal structures of bacterial CLC proteins (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	462	 In these bacterial CLC channels, the Cl--binding site closest to the extracellular end of the selectivity filter is gated by the carboxyl group of glutamate (E)148 that protrudes into the CLC channel pore: when the carboxyl group of E148 is bound to the Cl--binding site the pore is closed, but when a Cl- ion binds the pore opens to allow Cl- permeation (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	463	The regulation of CLC channel gating by localized motions of an amino acid side chain (Dutzler et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	464	, 2003) raises the question as to whether a similar mechanism might operate in the CFTR Cl- channel.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	465	 However, anion permeation through the CFTR pore is tightly linked to the function of the NBDs that power channel gating.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	466	 (2003) recently demonstrated that glutathione permeation through the CFTR pore is controlled by ATP binding rather than ATP binding and hydrolysis as in the case of Cl- permeation.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	467	 These data suggest that global conformation changes in the structure of the CFTR protein control Cl- permeation, not local changes in the orientation of amino acid side-chains.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	468	 If this idea were correct, it would suggest that CFTR channel gating shares similarities with activation gating in K+ channels that involves the reorientation of transmembrane -helices (Jiang et al.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	469	 Future studies should test this possibility.

0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	473	 For example, at -100 mV basal current was -0.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	474	20 pA and at +100 mV basal current was 2.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	475	 When basal currents were subtracted from those recorded in the presence of ATP (1 mM) + PKA (75 nM), the outward rectification of basal current accounted for 6  plus or minus  2% (n = 10) of the inward rectification of CFTR Cl- current at +100 mV.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	476	2 In contrast to analyses of rate constant values at  plus or minus 75 mV using Student's paired t test, some analyses of rate constant data over the range -75 to +75 mV using one-way ANOVAs failed to achieve statistical significance.
0.44508743.14581585.html.plaintext.txt	477	 We attribute this difference to the fact that paired data were used for analyses using Student's paired t test, but pooled data were used for one-way ANOVAs.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In stably transfected LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) epithelial cells, F508 CFTR conforms to this paradigm and is not present at the plasma membrane.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, when confluent LLC-PK1 cells expressing F508 CFTR were treated with DMSO and mounted in an Ussing chamber, a further increase in cAMP-activated short-circuit current (i.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The results raise the possibility that increased epithelial differentiation might increase the delivery of F508 CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where the F508 protein is shielded from degradative pathways such as the proteasome and allowed to mature.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Butyrate, an epithelial differentiating agent, has been shown to augment F508 maturation in nonpolarized cells grown on plastic (3).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Another report suggested the possibility that butyrate increases ion transport in CF nasal epithelia, although augmentation of F508 maturation was not directly shown (36).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Improvements in F508 CFTR due to butyrate have not been attributed to differentiating effects per se but to increased CFTR mRNA and protein levels.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The F508 folding defect is also temperature sensitive and influenced by high concentrations of glycerol (7, 37).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	20	 CFTR normally functions as a Cl channel in the context of polarized epithelial monolayers.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, interventions that activate maturation and Cl secretion through F508 CFTR in physiologically important systems such as polarized epithelial cell monolayers have been difficult to establish.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	22	An effort in many laboratories has been directed toward development of channel openers for the F508 CFTR.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Because studies of F508 processing have focused on undifferentiated cells, less information is available concerning CFTR maturation in polarized epithelia.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Previous observations in other laboratories suggest that measurable amounts of F508 protein might be present in highly differentiated F508 human nasal epithelial cells (9), CF sweat ducts in situ (35), or in the nasal airways of F508 CFTR mice (22).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the present experiments, we adapted LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells transfected with CFTR cDNAs for measurement of transepithelial Cl transport.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although the kidney-derived LLC-PK1 cell line does not endogenously express wild-type or F508 CFTR, the processing of wild-type and mutant CFTR in this cell type has been carefully studied and found to closely resemble the behavior of other epithelial cells that do endogenously express CFTR (28).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, kidney-derived epithelia have been a useful model system for characterizing effects due to epithelial differentiation.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	94	DMSO treatment of LLC-PK1 cells expressing F508 CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	95	 DMSO, like butyrate, displays potent activity as an epithelial differentiating agent (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Both drugs cause changes in the display of plasma membrane glycoproteins in epithelial cells, although the two compounds are believed to act by independent mechanisms (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Dose and time dependencies of DMSO treatment (0, 2, 5, and 10% DMSO for 1, 6, or 12 h and 1, 3, 4, and 5 days) were evaluated systematically in LLC-PK1 cells that express recombinant F508 CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We found that treatment for 4 days with 2% DMSO led to maximal effects on F508 maturation and transepithelial Cl transport in these cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This 2% DMSO schedule had no visible effect on cell viability, and, in a quantitative assay of cell growth (CellTiter 96, Promega), the well-known differentiating effects of DMSO (which slow cell proliferation) decreased cell proliferation in the LLC-PK1 cells by only ~15%.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We therefore settled on this schedule for future studies.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	101	 We studied LLC-PK1 cells expressing wild-type or F508 CFTR and the parental (non-CFTR expressing) LLC-PK1 cell line (28).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	102	DMSO treatment leads to a mature, band C form of F508 CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Incomplete processing of CFTR can be identified by the absence of a mature, fully glycosylated (band C) form of the protein (4).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Lower-molecular-weight forms of CFTR (e.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	105	, band B) represent the high-mannose, endoglycosidase H-sensitive forms of the protein that are established cotranslationally in the ER.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The maturation of CFTR from core to complex glycosylation reflects the transition of the protein from the ER to the Golgi, where attachment of carbohydrates and trimming are accomplished as CFTR proceeds to the trans-Golgi network.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR after a 4-day pretreatment with DMSO is shown in Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The result shows the appearance of mature, fully glycosylated CFTR after DMSO treatment in F508 cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This result supports the notion that F508 maturation is augmented by DMSO.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Figure 1 also indicates a small increase in total CFTR protein in LLC-PK1 cells after DMSO treatment.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	111	 To determine whether this increase was due to effects on steady-state levels of mRNA, we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR from total cellular mRNA.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	112	 DMSO did not appear to cause increases in CFTR mRNA levels as judged by this RT-PCR assay (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Unlike previous reports concerning butyrate treatment (3), the experiment suggests that increased F508 CFTR mRNA does not account for the modest increase in total F508 protein after DMSO treatment or the increase in band C.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These results also suggest that DMSO promotes F508 maturation through a mechanism that is different from that observed with butyrate.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The antibody used in these experiments has been validated previously by its ability to immunoprecipitate either truncated CFTR or full-length CFTR, immunolocalize CFTR to cells overexpressing the protein, and correctly identify the presence or absence of CFTR in vivo from salivary gland sections of CFTR wild-type or knockout mice of the same strain (5, 16, 17, 33).

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Each of these interventions has been shown to augment F508 processing in certain cell types grown on plastic (3, 7, 37).

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	205	 These results are significant because they suggest that DMSO acts to potentiate F508 CFTR maturation through a mechanism that 1) is different from that observed with glycerol or butyrate, 2) is more potent than can be obtained with glycerol or butyrate, at least in the LLC-PK1 model, and 3) allows insertion of the F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane of a transporting cellular monolayer in vitro.

0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	216	In LLC-PK1 cells grown on plastic, F508 CFTR is absent from the plasma membrane (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	217	 3) but can be detected at the cell surface when cells are grown as a monolayer on a permeable support (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The maturation of F508 CFTR can be augmented further by treatment with nontoxic concentrations of a differentiation agent known to increase epithelial cell polarity, DMSO (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The in vitro model described here for cell monolayers (as opposed to previous studies of nonpolarized cells grown on plastic) might be useful in the development of procedures to augment F508 CFTR maturation or to study openers of F508 CFTR Cl channels present in the plasma membrane.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	220	We tested the possibility that DMSO, like butyrate, increases F508 CFTR mRNA levels (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	221	 We saw no evidence of increased CFTR mRNA in either wild-type or F508 LLC-PK1 cells under the same DMSO treatment conditions that partially corrected F508 protein processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Moreover, butyrate treatment of F508 cells at 5 mM caused no improvement in Cl transport in an Ussing chamber protocol.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These results suggest that DMSO augments the maturation of F508 CFTR by a mechanism that is different from the known effects of butyrate.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	224	 DMSO has also recently been suggested to act as a "chemical chaperone" and to correct the folding and biogenesis of the pathogenic prion protein in vitro (W.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Welch, personal communication).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Although it is possible that DMSO has effects on CFTR folding, there is no direct evidence in our experiments that DMSO can reach cytoplasmic levels that alter the kinetics, efficiency, or other aspects of CFTR folding in living cells to augment F508 CFTR processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Therefore, although an effect on CFTR folding remains an important consideration in our experiments, further studies will be necessary to test a direct role for DMSO as a chemical chaperone for CFTR.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	228	In our experiments, interventions that increase epithelial cell polarity and differentiation also conferred increases in F508 CFTR maturation.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Growth of epithelial cells on permeable supports is a well-established method of augmenting epithelial cell differentiation and has been described previously as leading to dome formation and a more differentiated phenotype in many cell types (13, 18, 25).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	230	 LLC-PK1 cells have previously been reported to switch from an undifferentiated to a more differentiated phenotype when grown on filters (48).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This method was therefore selected as one way to increase cell polarity in our experiments.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	232	 We showed that growth on permeable supports also led to functionally detectable F508 CFTR in the plasma membrane by Isc measurements (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	233	 DMSO treatment is another well-described method for augmenting cell differentiation in epithelial cells derived from different tissues (14, 23, 31, 40).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Accordingly, we tested the influence of DMSO on F508 CFTR maturational processing.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	235	 DMSO treatment caused increased resistance in LLC-PK1 monolayers (presumably on the basis of greater organization of tight junctions), and the same treatment led to further increases in F508 CFTR activity at the cell surface (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Moreover, we observed that organization of tight junctions in LLC-PK1 cells increased under the same conditions that led to F508 maturation (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Finally, vectoral chloride transport (Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	238	 5) should only be detectable in a polarized epithelial monolayer and was observed in our studies of anion transport.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Together, these experiments indicate that a more differentiated phenotype also confers an increase in F508 CFTR maturation.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The effect of DMSO on F508 CFTR processing was also observed in primary human nasal polyp cells but not in nonepithelial cells (mouse fibroblast, L cells; Fig.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Experiments in these other cell types suggest the usefulness of the approach for activating F508 processing in human epithelial cells.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	242	Transmembrane proteins are often distributed throughout the plasma membrane when cells are undifferentiated.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	243	 With the onset of differentiation and the development of adherens junctions, tight junctions, and cell matrix interactions, structural polarity is established.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The process by which proteins target to the apical membrane appears to occur by a default mechanism (10).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Our results may indicate that cellular polarity helps establish part of this default pathway.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The possibility that F508 CFTR enters the apical targeting pathway specifically after an increase in cellular differentiation is suggested by results in Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Other contributors to F508 maturation, including stabilization of the folded structure of F508 protein, a change in F508 CFTR interactions with cellular chaperones, or a decrease in the rate of degradation of F508 CFTR in the ER (so as to allow more time to reach the Golgi), are among the alternative explanations for the findings shown here.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	248	In summary, the ER in epithelial cells is a hostile environment, insofar as the CFTR is concerned.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Wild-type and F508 molecules, even when folded into functional Cl channels, are polyubiquitinated and degraded in short order (half time of ~30 min) by the proteasome and possibly other proteolytic pathways (20, 44).
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	250	 CFTR that escapes the ER and enters the Golgi may reach a "safe haven," where half time increases to  > 12 h for the post-ER form.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Our data suggest, after DMSO treatment in LLC-PK1 cells, an increased amount of the post-ER complex-glycosylated and membrane-localized F508 CFTR is observed.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Because neither block of ubiquitination nor proteasome inhibition has been reported to enhance F508 maturation, it is less likely that the effects observed here are caused by blockade of the proteasome or of ubiquitination.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Our results raise the possibility that induction of polarity in LLC-PK1 cells might increase a transition of F508 CFTR from the ER to the trans-Golgi network (Figs.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	254	 If the F508 CFTR quality control mechanism becomes "leaky" in differentiated cells compared with the undifferentiated state, the findings could have important implications concerning the in vivo processing of F508 CFTR, which occurs in well-organized cells within tissues characterized by tight junctions and polarity.
0.42564055.9688615.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Further experiments are needed to test this possibility, as well as to test the effects of DMSO treatment in F508 CF mice.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	2	   Abstract TOP Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results and Discussion Conclusions Acknowledgements References   Over the past decade, nearly 1,000 variants have been identified in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in classic and atypical cystic fibrosis (CF) patients worldwide, and an enormous wealth of information concerning the structure and function of the protein has also been accumulated.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	3	 These data, if evaluated together in a sequence comparison of all currently available CFTR homologs, are likely to refine the global structure-function relationship of the protein, which will, in turn, facilitate interpretation of the identified mutations in the gene.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Based on such a combined analysis, we had recently defined a "functional R domain" of the CFTR protein.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	5	 First, presenting two full-length cDNA sequences (termed sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II) from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and an additional partial coding sequence from the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), this study went further to refine the boundaries of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and the COOH-terminal tail (C-tail), wherein NBD1 was defined as going from P439 to G646, NBD2 as going from A1225 to E1417, and the C-tail as going from E1418 to L1480.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This approach also provided further insights into the differential roles of the two halves of CFTR and highlighted several well-conserved motifs that may be involved in inter- or intramolecular interactions.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, a serious concern that a certain fraction of missense mutations identified in the CFTR gene may not have functional consequences was raised.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Finally, phylogenetic analysis of all the full-length CFTR amino acid sequences and an extended set of exon 13 to coding nucleotide sequences reinforced the idea that the rabbit may represent a better CF model than the mouse and strengthened the assertion that a long-branch attraction artifact separates the murine rodents from the rabbit and the guinea pig, the other Glires.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The encoded 1,480-amino-acid protein functions mainly as a chloride selective ion channel and is composed of two structurally homologous halves, with each half consisting of a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD); the two halves are linked by a unique regulatory or R domain.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The MSDs contribute to the formation of the chloride selective pore, the NBDs bind and hydrolyze ATP to regulate channel gating, and R domain phosphorylation controls channel activity (for reviews, see Gadsby and Nairn 1999 ; Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, there is increasing evidence that CFTR can affect the transport of other ions, including HCO-3 (Choi et al.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	14	 1989 ) has promoted extensive research activities in two interrelated aspects: first, identification of CFTR mutations in classic and atypical CF patients, and second, elucidation of the functional role of CFTR in both the normal and the diseased states during the past decade.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, while screening for CFTR mutations has become a purely molecular pursuit (currently, nearly 1,000 DNA variants of the gene are deposited in the CF Mutation Data Base: http://www.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This is especially the case with the vast number of missense mutations (40%), most of which are rare or even "private.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	18	" The formidable nature of this situation lies in the large size and complexity of the gene and, more importantly, in the complex multidomain structure of the protein.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	19	Although functional analysis, which unfortunately is still not routinely available, will continue to be used to bridge this gap, it can be complemented with other strategies.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In this regard, the impact of comparative sequence analysis has been tremendous.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Even the originally proposed CFTR structure, which has proved to be remarkably prescient, was largely based on a comparison of human CFTR with a number of other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family members (Riordan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Furthermore, cross-species sequence comparisons between the small number of CFTR homologs available in the early 1990s highlighted that identified mutations had occurred in evolutionary conserved residues (Diamond et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	23	 1991 ; Tucker, Tannahill, and Higgins 1992 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These early but necessarily limited analyses clearly demonstrated the importance of evolutionary information in interpreting the effects of mutations and have also frequently been taken into account in the design of functional studies.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Therefore, such a large number of missense mutations identified in the human CFTR and the abundance of structural and functional analysis data accumulated over the past decade, if evaluated together in the context of a sequence comparison of all of the currently available CFTR orthologs, will allow a significantly improved refinement of the domain structure of CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This will, in turn, facilitate interpretation of the identified mutations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The central thesis of this work represents such an attempt, and, towards that end, the already large number of CFTR orthologs has been expanded by the determination of the sequences of two full-length CFTR orthologous isoforms from a single teleost fish species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	28	The availability of this newly expanded number of CFTR sequences also offered an opportunity to reevaluate the use of mouse models for CF studies and, from a phylogenetic point of view, to check whether the paraphyly of the Glires (Lagomorpha and Rodentia), determined using CFTR sequences, was reliable or simply the result of a long-branch attraction artifact between the long rodent branch and the very divergent outgroup (Xenopus) (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In this regard, a partial coding sequence from the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus; a marsupial mammal whose divergence time with placental mammals is about 120 Myr) was also produced in order to determine whether such an outgroup long-branch attraction artifact existed.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	60	 First, salmon are capable of adapting rapidly from freshwater to seawater (Buf 1993 ), and we presumed this unique phenomenon of osmoregulation to be associated with the expression of a CFTR homolog.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Second, salmon were more distantly related to humans than most of the then-already-analyzed organisms, including mice (Tata et al.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	65	Candidate PCR fragments were generated from salmon gill tissue using degenerate oligonucleotide primers.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	66	 After many rounds of cloning, sequencing, and sequence aligning (which was particularly complicated by the unexpected presence of two highly homologous but clearly different sequences), two CFTR transcripts were finally obtained.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Sequence accuracy of the two transcripts was ensured by isoform-specific PCR amplifications using cDNA samples prepared from individual salmon.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The general properties of the two transcripts, which were designated sCFTR-I (GenBank accession number AF155237) and sCFTR-II (GenBank accession number AF161070), respectively, are summarized in table 1 .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Although there is no guarantee that the 5' UTR of each sequence is complete, the 3' UTR of each sequence is considered complete due to the presence of a polyA addition signal sequence 16 bp (for sCFTR-I) or 12 bp (for sCFTR-II) upstream of the polyA tail.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Moreover, the existence of two different genes encoding the same product is not entirely surprising, as many fish species, including salmonids (Hordvik 1998 ), have undergone tetraploidization events during their evolutionary histories, and duplication of certain hormone genes (e.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Furthermore, there is also circumstantial evidence suggesting the presence of two CFTR genes in another teleost fish, the killifish: two transcripts and two polypeptides were detected in the gill by Northern blotting (Singer et al.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These observations, taken together, strongly suggest that sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II represent different isoforms and that the presence of duplicate CFTR isoforms may be a more general phenomenon in teleost fish species.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	123	  Refinement of the Boundaries of NBD1 NBD1 was originally defined as going from amino acid F433 to amino acid I586 (human CFTR notation throughout the text) (Riordan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This definition has subsequently been modified by several structural models (Annereau et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	125	 1997 ; Hoedemaeker, Davidson, and Rose 1998 ), whose common feature is an extended COOH terminus of NBD1 beyond residue I586.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Complementary to these observations, the originally defined R domain has also been challenged (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000 and references therein).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In particular, the boundaries of NBD1 were recently investigated with a carefully designed functional approach, where CFTR channel constructs were severed near the likely NH2- or COOH-terminal boundaries of NBD1, systematically along the primary sequence, and successful assembly of each pair of channel segments was measured by CFTR channel activity (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	128	 With each additional piece of information, the precise boundaries of NBD1 have begun to emerge, and here they are tentatively defined as going from P439 to G646 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	129	The new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 combines the following considerations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The principal evidence comes from evolutionary data.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	131	 As illustrated in figure 2 , there is a sharp increase in sequence conservation beginning at P439 in comparison with the immediately preceding sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The first six amino acids of the originally defined NBD1 (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	133	, F433 to T438) are quite divergent (even to the extent of deletions having occurred in several species), and the upstream region is a divergent sequence track of 20 amino acids.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In contrast, downstream of P439, not only is there a stringently conserved three-amino-acid motif (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	135	, P439-V440-L441), but also most of the nonstringently conserved residues from K442 to A457 have changes mainly involving substitutions between conservative amino acids, and this region is then followed by the highly conserved Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acid 458 to amino acid 465).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	136	 A similar transition from divergence to sequence conservation is also present in the equivalent location of the aligned sequences of other ABC transporter family members, as illustrated in a sequence comparison of the 17 bacterial membrane proteins that form the periplasmic permease gene family (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Second, this definition is consistent with most of the structural models of human CFTR, where the NH2 terminus of NBD1 was regarded as T438 (Higgins 1992 ), L441 (Bianchet et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	138	 1997 ), and around V440 (Hoedemaeker, Davidson, and Rose 1998 ), respectively.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This definition also appears to correlate reasonably well with the three-dimensional crystal structure of HisP (the ATP-binding subunit of the bacterial histidine transporter), where P439 would be predicted to occur at the very beginning of the second ss strand of HisP (Hung et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Third, this definition falls within amino acids N432 to E449 the functionally defined NH2 terminus of NBD1 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Finally, this definition is given further support by the mutational pattern in this transitional region (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	142	However, one may argue that the new definition of the NH2 terminus of NBD1 might have inappropriately excluded the sequences aligned to the first ss strand of HisP (Hung et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Of particular relevance to this point is residue F433, an aromatic amino acid that corresponds to residue Y16 of the HisP.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The structure of HisP has been considered a good model for the binding of ATP to an NBD, in which the aromatic Y16 was confirmed to play a critical role (as determined by mutational studies by Shyamala et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Moreover, the structures of the other two prokaryotic NBD proteins, LivF and the amino-terminal NBD of RbsA, show a very similar binding interaction between the NBD and ATP, that is, the side chain of an aromatic residue (analogous to Y16 in HisP) interacts with the adenine ring of ATP to stabilize nucleotide binding.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Furthermore, an aromatic residue 20 to 30 amino acids upstream of the start of the Walker A motif (in a similar position relative to Y16 in HisP) is conserved in other ABC transporter NBDs (summarized in Berger and Welsh 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	147	 By inference, F433 in the human CFTR may participate in ATP binding.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	148	 However, a recent functional analysis has refuted such a possibility and highlighted the unique structure of CFTR NBD compared with other NBD structures (Berger and Welsh 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Undoubtedly, this finding adds further weight to the newly defined NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	150	We previously defined the NH2 terminus of the R domain as beginning at C647 (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Consequently, G646 could be considered the COOH terminus of NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, the concurrent functional approach defined the COOH terminus of NBD1 as occurring between G622 and Q634 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Nevertheless, G646 seems to be a more logical positioning of the true boundary linking NBD1 and the R domain in CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition to the previous arguments (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) , further supporting evidence also exists.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Again, the principal evidence comes from evolutionary data.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	156	 As indicated in figure 2 , the sequence from S623 to G646 is as well conserved as that from F587 to G622; the latter is the common part of the extended NBD1 in the two studies (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	157	 2000; Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Perhaps a more important indication comes from a sequence alignment with other ABC transporter NBDs; for example, HisP ends exactly at residue G646 of the human CFTR homolog (see fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Moreover, it is important to note that the functional assembly of paired CFTR segments severed at L633/Q634 is not as good as that of those cleaved at N432/F433 (Chan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In this regard, it will be interesting to compare paired CFTR fragments cleaved at the newly defined NBD1/R domain boundary (i.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	161	, G646/C647) with those cleaved at L633/Q634.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	162	Refinement of the Boundaries of NBD2 The original location in the amino acid sequence of NBD2 is from Y1219 to R1386 (Riordan et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Historically, NBD2 has received much less attention than NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Now, with the boundaries of NBD1 redefined, those of NBD2 can be similarly refined.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Accordingly, the NH2 terminus of NBD2 could be defined as going from A1225 by reference to the relative position of the highly conserved Walker A motif, and this also correlates fairly well with the mutational pattern (the appearance of missense mutations clustering around the Walker A motif: GRTGSGKS, at amino acid 1244 to amino acid 1251) in the transitional region in NBD2 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, when the COOH terminus of NBD2 is extended to P1443 by reference to the redefined NBD1 (see also fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	167	 1998 ), the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2" shows poor sequence conservation.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Yet, this is not so surprising if it is considered in the context of the ABC transporter family, where for example, its counterpart region in the 17 bacterial periplasmic permeases is similarly divergent (Mimura, Holbrook, and Ames 1991 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Thus, it seems clear that the very COOH-terminal portions of NBDs are, in general, less functionally restrained throughout the ABC transporter family, although this is in stark contrast to the NBD1 of CFTR, where the very COOH-terminal portion is highly conserved (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	170	 While it is not clear whether this sequence conservation is related to the immediately following R domain (which is unique to CFTR), it lends further weight to the unique structure of CFTR NBD1.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	171	Although P1443 could represent the COOH terminus of a "new NBD2," this should not be accepted without any reservations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The significant sequence divergence of the very COOH-terminal portion of this "new NBD2," the different structural requirements of a CFTR NBD compared with other ABC transporter NBDs in general (Berger and Welsh 2000) , and the differential roles between the CFTR NBD1 and NBD2 in particular (discussed below) argue for an alternative definition.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Here again, it is reassuring how well the evolutionary data, clinical observations, and functional studies concur.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The initial location of sequence divergence in this transitional region was clearly situated at E1418 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In addition, the shortest truncation that is associated with CF disease (with pancreatic insufficiency and recurrent pulmonary infection) terminates at Q1412 (http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Furthermore, a review of several functional studies clearly points to the fact that CFTR truncated at/or upstream of V1415 significantly affects the biogenesis, maturation, and stability of the protein, but those molecules truncated at or downstream of N1419 do not (Rich et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	177	 1999 ; Gentzsch and Riordan 2001 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These three lines of observation, together with the mutational pattern in this region, strongly suggest that residue E1417 can be confidently assigned as the COOH terminus of NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This new definition is also further validated by the analysis which has redefined the C-tail of the CFTR (discussed below).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	180	Functional Delineation of the C-Tail The COOH terminus of NBD2 could naturally be anticipated to be the NH2 boundary of the C-tail, and this appears to best delineate its functional role in the CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	181	 On the one hand, the newly defined C-tail is "nonessential," as the effects on the biogenesis, processing, and stability of the CFTR previously assigned to the original C-tail have now been relocated to within the newly defined NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, even the two trafficking signals thought to reside in the newly defined C-terminal tail, at Y1424 and the dileucine pair at L1430-L1431, have been demonstrated not to alter the steady-state amount of nascent or mature CFTR in recent functional studies (Gentzsch and Riordan 2001) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	183	 On the other hand, the newly defined C-tail does appear to be "essential," as the well-conserved motif involving the final three amino acids (TRL) represents a PDZ-interacting domain which is required for the polarization of CFTR to the apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells (Moyer et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Even so, it is important to note that this PDZ-binding motif alone is not sufficient for the polarized distribution of CFTR (Milewski et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Therefore, the C-tail as a whole would play a minor role in the pathogenesis of CF disease.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Indeed, neither S1455X (Mickle et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	187	ca/cftr) caused a severe CF phenotype.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	188	 By inference, any single missense mutations identified in the C-tail may not have a significant functional consequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Consistent with this hypothesis, none of the three missense mutations identified in this region (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	190	 2 ) can be confidently assigned as causal for CF disease; for example, R1422W was identified in a CF patient who also carried the mutations F508del and D993Y, and R1453W was identified in a patient with diffuse panbronchiolitis (http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Finally, attention may be drawn to the well conserved, negatively charged motif (E1469 to E1474) in the C-tail.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	192	Further Insights into the Differential Function of NBD1 and NBD2 That the two NBDs are not functionally equivalent was immediately noticed in the early 1990s.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Not only were CF-associated mutations found predominantly in CFTR's NBD1 as opposed to NBD2, but also mutations of homologous amino acid residues within NBD1 or NBD2 resulted in different effects on CFTR maturation and function (Cheng et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	194	 More recently, the different roles of NBD1 and NBD2 in the CFTR chloride channel and the regulation of other ion channels have been further investigated through a variety of approaches (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	195	Apart from the fact that there are more disease-associated mutations in NBD1 than in NBD2, and more than half of the most common missense mutations or single-amino-acid deletions occur in NBD1, figure 2 reveals an additional interesting observation regarding mutational patterns in the well-conserved motifs in the NBDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	196	 While there are 17 missense mutations clustered in the LSGGQ motif (LSGGQ, amino acids 548 to 552) and the Walker B motif (RAVYKDADLYLLD, amino acids 560 to 572) in NBD1, there are only four missense mutations in the equivalent regions (LSHGH [amino acids 1346 to 1350] and RSVLSKAKILLLD [amino acids 1358 to 1370]) of NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Conversely, while there is only one missense mutation in the Walker A motif (GSTGAGKT, amino acids 458 to 465) in NBD1, there are five mutations in the corresponding motif (GRTGSGKS, amino acids 1244 to 1251) in NBD2.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This finding is intriguing since, on the one hand, although Walker A and Walker B are presumably both involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	199	 On the other hand, while it is generally believed that ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 and NBD2 may drive channel opening and closing, respectively (reviewed by Nagel 1999 ), recent biochemical analysis suggests that opening and closing may occur as a consequence of nucleotide binding and dissociation or hydrolysis at a functional unit involving both domains (Aleksandrov et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therefore, it is tempting to ask whether the distinct mutational patterns in these important motifs are linked intrinsically to functional differences of the Walker A and Walker B sites within the two NBDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Elucidation of this question would improve our understanding of the basic physiology of CFTR, as well as that of other ABC transporters.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Nevertheless, this observation gives further support to the idea that NBD1 and NBD2 make different contributions to the gating of CFTR channels.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	203	Further Insights into the Differential Role of MSD1 (F81 to V350) and MSD2 (I860 to S1150) Each MSD was predicted to contain six transmembrane segments (TMs), three extracellular loops (ECLs), and two intracellular loops (ICLs).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	204	 As in the case of the two NBDs, functional differences have also been found for the two MSDs (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	205	, Yue, Devidas, and Guggino 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	206	 A comparison of the stringently conserved residues in the TMs of the two MSDs reveals that the TMs in MSD1 are generally more conserved than those in MSD2 (data not shown; see also fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	207	 2 ); TM6 (12 out of 21 residues; 57.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	208	1%) and TM12 (11 out of 22 residues; 50.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	209	0%) are the most conserved motifs in the two MSDs, respectively, and TM6 is the most conserved of all.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The evolutionary conservation of these regions correlates perfectly with analysis that suggests that (1) TM6 and TM12 line the CFTR pore, (2) TM6 is the main determinant of the pore properties of CFTR, and (3) MSD1 and MSD2 each contribute differently to CFTR pore properties (Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	211	A defining feature of ion channels is their selectivity, the ability to pass certain ions at a high rate while at the same time effectively excluding others.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	212	 While discrimination between different cations in certain cation channels is known to occur over a short region of the pore known as the selectivity filter, the existence of a discrete anion selectivity filter in the pores of Cl- channels is controversial (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Nevertheless, based on the above-mentioned evolutionary data, such a selectivity filter in the CFTR, if it indeed exists, would most likely be located in the most highly conserved TM TM6.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Not surprisingly, the anion selectivity (Br-  >  Cl-  >  I-) of the CFTR pore was found to be mainly determined by the first half of the protein (Yue, Devidas, and Guggino 2000) , and mutations in several residues in TM6, including K335 (Anderson et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	215	 1991 ), F337 (Linsdell, Evagelidis, and Hanrahan 2000) , T338 (Linsdell, Zheng, and Hanrahan 1998 ), and R347 (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ), were shown to significantly affect anion selectivity.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Moreover, the stringently conserved motif T351-R352-Q353 immediately downstream of TM6 has also been suggested to loop back into the channel, narrowing the lumen and thereby forming both the major resistance to current flow and the anion selectivity filter (Cheung and Akabas 1997 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Assuming that an anion selectivity filter resides in the vicinity of TM6, it is interesting to note the presence of another highly conserved motif also in this vicinity (Q359-T360-W361-Y362-D363).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Furthermore, there is also a similarly stringently conserved motif downstream of TM12 in MSD2, L1156-M1157-R1158-S1159-V1160.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	219	Inspection of figure 2 also reveals that the four ICLs are generally more conserved than the TM and ECL subdomains in the MSDs.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	220	 To date, most of the missense mutations identified in each ICL and a 19-amino-acid deletion concerning ICL2 have been investigated by functional analysis (reviewed in Sheppard and Welsh 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	221	 These studies strongly indicated that the ICLs were critical for correct protein processing.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Among the four ICLs, ICL4 (amino acid Q1035 to amino acid R1102, with a sequence homology as high as 72% across the 15 CFTR species) turns out to be the most conserved subdomain in the entire CFTR sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This stringent sequence conservation, coupled with a cluster of missense mutations identified in this subdomain (among which two homozygosities, H1085R [Yoshimura et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	224	 1999 ] and R1066C [Casals et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	225	 1997 ], cause a severe CF phenotype), undoubtedly underlies its functional significance within CFTR.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	226	 While a large fraction of the analyzed ICL4 missense mutations disrupted the biosynthetic processing of CFTR, this was not universally the case.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Most importantly, those processed mutants had no discernible effect on the channel's pore properties, but they did alter gating behavior, the response to increasing concentrations of ATP, and stimulation in response to pyrophosphate (Cotten et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Thus, ICL4, and probably the other three ICLs, may actively participate in interdomain interactions; for example, they may link the NBDs to MSDs, thereby coupling the activity of NBDs to the gating of the channel.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	229	Possible Motifs Implicated in the Interdomain Interaction Between the NH2-Terminal Tail (N-tail; M1 to R80) and the R Domain An eliciting finding is that the N-tail controls CFTR channel gating through a physical interaction with the R domain.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Not surprisingly, this positive regulatory activity was mapped to a cluster of acidic residues, D47, E51, E54, and D58, within the highly charged and conserved motif D44 to E60 (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Since no effects of any of the N-tail mutations on steady-state phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo were detected, the N-tail most likely modulates channel activity by controlling access of the phosphorylated R domain to inhibitory or stimulatory sites within the channel (Naren et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	232	The fact that a cluster of stringently conserved acidic residues in the N-tail appears to bind to part of the R domain (most probably the region involving amino acids 708 to 740 and the nearby surrounding sequences; Naren et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	233	 As illustrated in figure 2 , there are three highly conserved, positively charged motifs (K696-R697-K698, R709-K710, and R764-R765-R766) in this region.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Although the conservation of these motifs may be explained by the fact that they potentially participate in phosphorylation of the R domain, the possibility that all, or at least some, of them serve as counterparts to the acidic residues in the N-tail cannot be excluded, particularly if the fact that none of them appear to be phosphyorylated by PKA in vivo is taken into account (Cheng et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	235	 More recently, a relatively small portion of the R domain (residues 760 to 783) that encompasses the stringently conserved motif (R765-R766-Q767-S768-V769-L760) was found to be critical for the prevention of constitutive activity of the CFTR (Baldursson et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	236	 This further highlights the functional importance of these motifs when it is considered that they are conserved even within the most evolutionarily divergent R domain sequences.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Future studies focusing on these motifs may result in the revelation of further novel molecular mechanisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	238	How Many Missense Mutations Are Functional? Unlike splicing and truncating mutations, it is always difficult to assign a definitive role to missense mutations, especially when they are detected in single cases.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Functional analysis provides important data, but extrapolation to clinical effects may not be straightforward.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This can be seen in the conflicting results that often occur in some aspects of CF research, exemplified by the two different models for salt and water transport across epithelia (reviewed by Wine 1999 ), as well as the disparity among results on the intracellular localization of F508del-CFTR (reviewed by Drumm 1999 ).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	241	 There is ongoing effort to tackle this issue (e.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	242	, the CF European Network: the Second Consensus Meeting Towards Validation of CFTR Gene Expression and Functional Assays, Estoril, March 30 to  April 1, 2001).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	243	We believe that a combined analysis of the currently available data can complement this effort and enhance our understanding of the identified mutations, particularly those that are missense.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Taking advantage of the previously redefined R domain, a systemic evaluation of the missense mutations occurring in this region was produced, and as a result, some of these mutations, such as F693L, V754M, and T760M, were identified as being likely to represent neutral polymorphisms (Chen, Scotet, and Ferec 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Similarly, the missense mutations occurring in evolutionarily divergent regions, for example, N418S, G424S, Q890R, and K1177R, may also represent neutral polymorphisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	246	 At the other extreme, for example, the mutations I506M and F508C, which occur in stringently conserved residues in the functionally important NBD1, have also been confirmed to be nonfunctional variants (Kobayashi et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	247	 1990 ; Kalin, Dork, and Tummler 1992 ; Will et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The assignment of mutations as in these two extreme cases would raise a serious concern that a certain fraction of the identified missense mutations in classic and atypical CF patients may in fact merely represent polymorphisms rather than mutations associated with the disease.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	249	 If this assumption is correct, it is not unreasonable to infer that the truly causal mutation event may remain unidentified in a certain fraction of patients in whom the disease has been incorrectly assumed to be caused by identified "missense mutations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	250	The above assumption is further supported by the following considerations.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The large size of the CFTR gene makes it difficult to analyze the entire coding sequence, not to mention the intronic sequence.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Consequently, initial identification of one DNA variant may discourage further screening efforts, thereby ignoring a second variant in cis in the gene.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Even if the whole CFTR gene were analyzed, certain variants, such as large deletions within the gene (which are being detected at an increasing rate; http://www.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	254	ca/cftr), are still not readily detected by common mutational screening techniques (Girodon-Boulandet, Cazeneuve, and Goossens 2000) .
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In addition, the promoter sequence (Romey et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	256	 1999 ) and the upstream regulatory region (Nuthall et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	257	 1999 ) of the CFTR gene may be targets for extended mutational screening.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Moreover, mutations in other genes in certain CF-like disease subjects should be considered (Mekus et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	259	Taken together, it is likely that a certain fraction of the missense mutations identified in the CFTR gene may be ultimately confirmed to be nonpathological polymorphisms.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It is even possible that some of them may turn out to be modifiers of another variant in the CFTR gene or even in another gene.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	261	 An answer to this question will significantly improve our understanding of the disease, as well as that of the protein itself.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Nevertheless, this vast number of missense mutations represents an invaluable resource for exploring the subtlety of the CFTR structure-function relationship, and figure 2 could serve as an important complement to ongoing mutation detection and functional analysis efforts in the CF field.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	263	A Comprehensive Phylogenetic Analysis: Implications for Animal Models of CF An additional dividend of the availability of a large number of CFTR sequences is their benefit concerning the use of animal models in CF studies.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	264	 We had previously suggested that the rabbit could be a better CF model than the current murine model, mainly based on (1) anatomical and developmental data, (2) comparison of CFTR promotor sequences and partial coding sequences, and (3) phylogenetic analysis of those sequences (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Although sequence comparisons clearly showed a higher similarity between rabbit and primate sequences than between murine and primate sequences or even between rabbit and murine sequences, the phylogenetic implications were ambiguous.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	266	A long-branch attraction artifact (Felsenstein 1978 ) of the murine lineage toward the outgroup was suspected (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This classical artifact of phylogenetics concerns all tree reconstruction methods.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It occurs when rates of character change vary among lineages, provoking in trees the grouping of lineages sharing close rates, whatever the evolutionary relationships.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	269	 To solve this ambiguity, additional sequence data (particularly from further species) were required for a successful analysis.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	270	 When all of the full-length CFTR amino acid sequences were analyzed in this study (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	271	 1 ), the murine lineage was the most basal of the placental mammals, a strange result possibly due to a long-branch attraction.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Moreover, the position of the rabbit was ambiguous.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In the most parsimonious tree (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	274	 1 ) and in the neighbor-joining tree from corrected distances (data not shown), the rabbit is a sister group to the bovids + primates clade.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In the neighbor-joining tree based on uncorrected distances, the rabbit is the sister group to the primates as in our previous report (Vuillaumier et al.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	276	 When an extended set of exon 13 to coding sequences including a nonplacental mammal (the kangaroo) and another nonmurid rodent (guinea pig) were analyzed (fig.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	277	 3 ), the guinea pig represented a sister group to the rabbit corresponding to the Glires (node E), while the murids were still the most basal of the placental mammals.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Assuming that rodents are a monophyletic group (Novacek and Wyss 1986 ; Luckett and Hartenberger 1993 ; Philippe 1997 ), it appears that the murids are artifactually basal in the placental tree, as they should be a sister group to the guinea pig within clade E.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Thus, the high level of divergence of the mouse sequence not only makes the mouse an inappropriate model for CF studies, but also provokes a phylogenetic artifact.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Unfortunately, the addition of the kangaroo sequence did not correct this artifact, as it was added as a taxon closer to placental mammals than the frog is, in order to break a long branch that could have reduced the possibility of the murid long-branch attraction.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Nevertheless, the conclusions from the phylogenetic analysis do not challenge the proposition of the rabbit as a better CF model whose sequence is more closely related to humans (than murine species are).
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Additionally, the guinea pig appears to be an equally good model candidate.

0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Particularly, we cloned two distinct CFTR sequences from the Atlantic salmon, the first time that two isoforms of CFTR have ever been reported in a single species.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The availability of this newly expanded set of CFTR homologs has allowed the most comprehensive cross-species sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis ever to be performed.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	297	 While the combined analysis of the current mutational, structural, and functional data in conjunction with the above sequence comparison has yielded tantalizing insights into the global CFTR structure-function relationship, the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis reinforces the idea that the rabbit may represent a better CF model than the mouse and strengthens the assertion that a long-branch attraction artifact separates the murine rodents from the rabbit and the guinea pig, the other Glires.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Hopefully, the refined boundaries of the two NBDs and the C-tail and the proposed CF model animal will provide a framework for future investigations, and the stringently conserved motifs within CFTR may represent good candidates or targets for identifying sites participating in inter- or intramolecular interactions.
0.41600177.11504857.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Such knowledge will help to further resolve the diversity and complexity of CFTR defects and lead to a better treatment of the disease.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	4	Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and of at least one other member of the ATP-binding cassette family of transport proteins, P-glycoprotein, is associated with the electrodiffusional movement of the nucleotide ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Evidence directly implicating CFTR expression with ATP channel activity, however, is still missing.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here it is reported that reconstitution into a lipid bilayer of highly purified CFTR of human epithelial origin enables the permeation of both Cl and ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Similar to previously reported data for in vivo ATP currents of CFTR-expressing cells, the reconstituted channels displayed competition between Cl and ATP and had multiple conductance states in the presence of Cl and ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Purified CFTR-mediated ATP currents were activated by protein kinase A and ATP (1 mM) from the "intracellular" side of the molecule and were inhibited by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, glibenclamide, and anti-CFTR antibodies.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The absence of CFTR-mediated electrodiffusional ATP movement may thus be a relevant component of the pleiotropic cystic fibrosis phenotype.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	12	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) supports ATP-dependent Cl channel activity (3, 14).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	13	 However, controversy still exists as to whether this functional feature of CFTR is sufficient to explain the complete pathophysiology of this disease (7).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The cellular epithelial cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype, for example, is associated both with a dysfunctional phospholipase A2 activity and a deranged arachidonic acid metabolism (10, 24) and with an abnormally increased apical epithelial Na+ permeability (6), which is regulated by CFTR (26).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Expression of CFTR is also associated with the recovery of outwardly rectifying Cl channel activity of CF cells (12) by an autocoid mechanism entailing the release of cellular ATP, which, in turn, helps modulate other cell responses (23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These disparate observations are unlikely to stem from an altered Cl conductance.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Alternate paradigms to explain the various features of the CF phenotype are currently being sought.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	18	CFTR has been implicated in the release of cellular ATP (18, 23) and electrodiffusional ATP movement (17, 22, 23); however, other studies have failed to detect electrodiffusional ATP movement in preparations containing a functional CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In this report, we have revisited the question of whether CFTR is capable of permeating ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Highly purified and functional human epithelial recombinant CFTR (14) was reconstituted into a lipid bilayer in which addition of protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP elicited diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC)-inhibitable Cl- and ATP-permeable ion channel activity, in agreement with our previous findings in intact cells (9, 22, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The present data indicate that ATP transfer by CFTR may not require an "adjacent" transmembrane structure to allow permeation of the nucleotide.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Thus it is possible either that ATP4 (theoretical Er = 14 mV) makes a contribution to the ionic conductance of CFTR in the presence of MgATP or that CFTR is also permeable to Mg2+.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In either case, the CFTR preparation was permeable to ATP, which was further determined by replacing ATP salts.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In the presence of trans 100 mM Tris ATP (cis 10 mM MgATP), the single ATP channel conductance was 38.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The Er shifted, however, to 52.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	215	0 mV (n = 13), consistent with a strong difference in the permeabilities of both free and Mg2+-complexed ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These findings indicate that, although CFTR is capable of Cl permeation, its ability to preferentially move Cl or ATP may depend not only on the driving force for the intracellular nucleotide ATP but also on the ATP species, the PATP/PCl, and the intracellular Cl concentration.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Under physiological intracellular conditions (5 mM ATP and 30 mM Cl), ATP transport may be favored, however, as the electrochemical gradient for the multivalent ATP will be 1,000-fold higher than that for Cl (18, 22).

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	242	The expression of CFTR has been recently associated with the otherwise unapparent permeation of ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This phenomenon has been observed by the cAMP-induced release of ATP from CFTR-expressing cells under physiological conditions (18), as well as by electrophysiological studies under highly nonphysiological conditions (22), which determined, nevertheless, the channellike nature of the PKA-induced ATP movement at the single-molecule level (17, 22, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This is in agreement with our observation that cAMP activation is associated with extrusion of ATP in wild-type (18) but not in 508 CFTR-expressing cells (8).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The molecular steps associated with ATP movement in CFTR-expressing cells, however, have not been unequivocally determined.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Although the simplest possible explanation for these findings is to implicate CFTR itself as the channel responsible for the ATP-permeable pathway, direct evidence to support this claim is still lacking.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	247	ATP-permeable channels in CFTR-expressing cells may be a reflection of endogenous functional channel proteins that are regulated by, but are distinct from, CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	248	 For example, expression of both mammalian (1) and Drosophila melanogaster (5) P-glycoproteins, CFTR congeners of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins, has been associated with the expression of ATP channel activity, thus raising the possibility that transport proteins other than CFTR are present in certain preparations.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	249	 At least one recent report demonstrated an osmotically stimulated electrodiffusional ATP movement in human hepatoma cells seemingly devoid of CFTR (28).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	250	 A direct role of CFTR in ATP movement has also been questioned by recent reports that failed to detect ATP-permeable channel activity in cells or preparations containing CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	251	 However, these studies also failed to detect "any" other ATP channel activity, which is inconsistent with the ATP release associated with CFTR expression (18, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	252	 This raises the possibility that the presence of putative ATP-permeable pathways in CFTR-expressing preparations may largely depend on the cellular (tissue) model under study and/or the nature of the ATP complexes driven.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Alternate possibilities, however, may also entail more critical experimental conditions for determining ATP movement than previously expected.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	254	 A previous study that failed to detect ATP release from CFTR-expressing cells (27), for example, may have simply failed to meet the technological parameters suitable for detecting the expected amounts of ATP released to the extracellular milieu (18).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Furthermore, the possibility that under certain conditions, electroneutral ATP complexes are driven through channel structures cannot yet be ruled out.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	256	In this report, we revisited the question as to whether CFTR is responsible for ATP movement.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Reconstituted CFTR displayed ATP channel activity either in the absence or presence of Cl.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Several (including large) conductance states were also observed (see summary of results in Table 2), in agreement with our original in vivo observations (9, 22).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In those studies, both a 5-pS and a 50-pS ATP channel were observed.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	260	 At least two other groups have observed single-channel ATP currents associated with CFTR expression with a similar "low" (5-pS) conductance (16, 17, 23).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The issue of the single ATP channel conductance of CFTR may be confounded by the observation that both Cl and ATP modify each other's movement, thus changing the single-channel conductance of the ions in either direction (22).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In the presence of extracellular 100 mM MgATP and 140 mM intracellular Cl, the single ATP channel conductances rectified with a limiting conductance of 24.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	263	 22), which is different from the observed single-channel conductance for either ion alone (22).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Furthermore, a recent study also detected Cl channel rectification by CFTR, which is a striking departure from the established paradigm of CFTR behavior (15).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	265	 This report also summarizes previous data from the literature indicating that single-channel conductances from 7 to 13 pS have been previously attributed to CFTR (Ref.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	268	In the present report, addition of cis Cl (N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride, 50 mM) in the presence of 10 mM MgATP reduced the CFTR single-channel conductance from 25 to 11.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	269	 5D), a condition similar to previously reported values for CFTR-associated Cl movement (13).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	270	 This finding further suggests that both Cl and ATP may compete with each other for the conductance pore of the channel, as was originally reported in intact cells (22).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	271	Reconstituted CFTR ATP channel activity was readily inhibited by the anti R-domain CFTR antibody MAb 13-1 (Genzyme), in agreement with previous reports in intact cells (19).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The possibility that a functional CFTR is required to regulate ATP channels other than CFTR, however, cannot be easily ruled out, since, as indicated above, recent studies failed to detect any ATP-permeable channel activity in preparations containing CFTR (13, 21).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	273	 At least one such study was conducted with a purified CFTR preparation similar to the one presented in this report (13).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Thus a likely possibility is that activated CFTR, which is indeed permeable to Cl, may behave as an ATP-selective ion channel only under certain circumstances (see below).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	275	 It should also be noted that these reports did not exactly mimic our present or previous studies.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	276	 We have found that PKA activation of CFTR, for example, was readily observed (15 of 18 experiments) in experiments tested with daily fresh batches of PKA.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	277	 However, under certain experimental conditions, namely the use of "older" PKA (prepared  > 24 h before the experiments), CFTR activation under Cl-free conditions also required the presence of sustained holding potentials (between +100 and +150 mV; 41 of 82 experiments).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	278	 This finding may actually explain previous failed attempts to obtain single ATP channel currents from reconstituted CFTR in which PKA was absent (21) and further suggests the possibility that adjacent structures other than CFTR may also be required for proper channel activation in vivo (19).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	279	Although the reason for the required voltage activation of CFTR in the presence of PKA is as yet unknown, it is not unprecedented for ATP transport by other ABC transporters.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Concerning the electrodiffusional ATP movement by the murine mdr1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (1), for example, it was observed that a double mutation of this channel protein in either nucleotide-binding domain rendered the mutated P-glycoprotein completely unable to spontaneously release cellular ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	281	 However, voltage activation reestablished ATP transport and, interestingly, Cl channel activity associated with this protein as well (1).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Similar findings have also been recently observed with the D.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	283	 melanogaster mdr gene products Mdr65 and Mdr49 P-glycoprotein homologues, which were also voltage activated (5).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Although it is unlikely that this activation process has any physiological significance, it raises the interesting possibility that other relevant intracellular factors that are absent in the purified CFTR preparation may be required for a proper PKA activation of CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Under no circumstances, however, did voltage stimulation induce any ATP-permeable channel activity in the absence of PKA.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	286	The present data also dispel a common misconception about the size of ATP as it is transported through this channel molecule.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	287	 In solution, ATP takes various conformations by interacting with counterions other than Mg2+ (11).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	288	 However, only one conformation has been observed for the MgATP2 complex, the relevant moiety associated with molecules that bind and/or hydrolyze ATP (4, 11).
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The average planar diameter of the MgATP complex under these conditions is  < 5 A (see Fig.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	290	 6), at least similar to, if not smaller than, the expected diameter of I, a CFTR-permeable anion (for details, see Fig.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Thus ATP "size" is not a constraint to movement through CFTR, provided that it is either free or complexed to Mg2+.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Counterion-ATP complexes of larger sizes, however, may reflect different interactions with CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	293	 A recent paper (13), reporting that purified CFTR was tested and failed to detect ATP transport, suggested that the K2ATP salt used in that study actually blocked Cl movement through CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Because K+ is almost nine times larger than Mg2+, the larger K2ATP moiety is likely to be a blocking agent of CFTR channel activity.

0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Interestingly, however, both the cis concentration of Cl and the trans concentration of ATP modified the single-channel conductance of CFTR.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	325	In conclusion, the present data are consistent with the most likely, but not exclusive, possibility that CFTR permeates ATP.
0.43087202.9530112.html.plaintext.txt	326	 This is in close agreement with previous reports indicating that wild-type CFTR (9, 17, 22, 23), but not 508 CFTR (8), may be involved in ATP movement in vivo.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report that CFTR is sequestered into ER subdomains containing the chaperone Kar2p, and that sequestration and CFTR degradation are disrupted in sec12ts strain (mutant in guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Sar1p), sec13ts strain (mutant in the Sec13p component of COPII), and sec23ts strain (mutant in the Sec23p component of COPII) grown at restrictive temperature.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	71	 It is possible that yeast does not have sufficient machinery to efficiently fold overexpressed CFTR, or that even correctly folded CFTR is "read" by yeast as defective.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Because our EGFP-CFTR construct is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in yeast, we use it as an ERAD substrate to test Sar1p/COPII involvement in proteasomal targeting.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	94	  We performed immunofluorescence with known organellar markers to localize EGFP-CFTR.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	95	 2 B, EGFP-CFTR is not detected in small punctate structures containing the late Golgi marker Kex2p (Preuss et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This result agrees with findings that CFTR expressed in yeast undergoes ER-type N-glycosylation, but does not undergo Golgi-type oligosaccharide modifications (Kiser et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	97	 EGFP-CFTR is not detected on the plasma membrane, and does not colocalize with the fluorescent dye FM 4 to 64 (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The lack of vacuolar localization is consistent with lack of degradation of CFTR via the Pep4p/Prb1p vacuolar proteases (Kiser et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	100	EGFP-CFTR is detected in relatively large punctate structures that contain Kar2p (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In contrast, EGFP-CFTR cell shows clusters of membranous structures in proximity to the perinuclear ER (arrowheads).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Higher magnification shows them to be accumulations of tubular and vesicular elements, morphologically analogous to ER extensions observed in yeast expressing CFTR (Zhang et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The relative size of such clusters (average diameter 0.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	107	5 to 1  microm) corresponds to the approximate size of the fluorescent Kar2p/EGFP-CFTR puncta.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Significantly, membrane amplification induced by CFTR (Zhang et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	109	, 2001) or EGFP-CFTR (this work) is distinct from multi-layered ER "karmellae" induced by expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Koning et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Together, the data suggest that EGFP-CFTR localizes to subdomains of the ER network that represent penultimate stations before degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The results also imply that sequestration into the ER domains is more efficient than subsequent removal by degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	112	Functional Sar1p/COPII machinery is required for sorting EGFP-CFTR to ER subdomains To determine if the Sar1p/COPII machinery participates in sorting EGFP-CFTR, we examined its localization when COPII function is disrupted.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	113	 First, we tested the localization of EGFP-CFTR in wild-type, ubc6, and sec18 to 1 yeast strains when grown at 24 degrees C (permissive temperature for strains defective in COPII components) and when grown at 39 degrees C (restrictive temperature for strains defective in COPII components).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	114	 2 D, EGFP-CFTR in the wild-type strain remains as punctate spots at both temperatures.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Similarly, the pattern of EGFP-CFTR in the ubc6 strain defective for proteasomal degradation is analogous to that in the wild-type strain.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This strongly suggests that EGFP-CFTR is sorted into the punctate structure and maintained there before it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Our data, together with the finding that CFTR remains sequestered in Kar2p-containing subdomains in yeast strain (pre1 to 1pre2 to 2) defective for proteasomal degradation (Zhang et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	118	, 2001), suggest that the catalytic activity of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc6p is not sufficient to remove EGFP-CFTR from ER subdomains, and that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are tightly coupled.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	119	 The same punctate EGFP-CFTR pattern is observed in sec18 to 1 strain grown at either temperature, indicating that block in vesicular fusion during ER-Golgi protein transport does not significantly affect EGFP-CFTR sequestration.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	120	Analysis of EGFP-CFTR localization in the sec23 to 1ts strain (Kuehn et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	121	, 1998) showed significant temperature-dependent changes (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	122	 At the permissive temperature, EGFP-CFTR is sequestered into ER subdomains, but at the restrictive temperature, EGFP-CFTR is diffusely distributed throughout the ER in a pattern characteristic of ER proteins (compare enlargement with Kar2p staining in inset; Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Similar results were obtained when yeast strains mutant in other components of the Sar1p/COPII machinery (described below) were analyzed (unpublished data).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	124	Functional Sar1p/COPII machinery is required for EGFP-CFTR degradation To uncover whether the Sar1p/COPII machinery is also involved in CFTR degradation, we compared the degradation rate of EGFP-CFTR at permissive (24 degrees C) and restrictive (39 degrees C) temperature in yeast mutant in Sar1p/COPII components.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In wild-type strain, EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly at both temperatures, with a half-life of 10 to 15 min (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The temperature-sensitive strain, sec12 to 4ts, is defective in catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange on Sar1p at the restrictive temperature due to a P73L mutation (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	127	 EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly in the sec12 to 4ts strain at permissive temperature; with a half-life (10 min) analogous to that in wild-type strain (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In contrast, the degradation rate is delayed significantly when the yeast is shifted to the restrictive temperature, with the half-life extending to 40 to 45 min, a threefold increase compared with the permissive temperature.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The temperature-sensitive strains sec23 to 1ts and sec13 to 1ts (Salama et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	130	, 1997) are defective at the restrictive temperature due to an S382L mutation (Yoshihisa et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	131	, 1993), and a mutation that has not yet been identified, respectively.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In both cases, COPII function is compromised.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	133	 EGFP-CFTR is degraded rapidly in both sec23 to 1ts and sec13 to 1ts strains at the permissive temperature, with half-lives of  < 15 min (Fig.

0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	144	 EGFP-CFTR degradation is significantly inhibited by inactivation of Sec12p, Sec23p, and Sec13p.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	145	  It must be stressed that EGFP-CFTR, like other transmembrane ERAD substrates, does not enter the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Like the previously characterized CFTR (Kiser et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	147	, 2001), EGFP-CFTR is degraded with normal kinetics at permissive and restrictive temperatures in a sec18 to 1 strain (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The strain is defective in Sec18p function, as shown by a block in maturation of the vacuolar CPY at the restrictive temperature (Fig.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Together, the results indicate that ER-Golgi transport and recycling are not required for EGFP-CFTR degradation.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Our findings suggest a novel role for the Sar1p/COPII sorting machinery.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In addition to selecting correctly folded substrates into the forward secretory pathway (Schekman and Orci, 1996; Bannykh et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	152	, 2000) and selecting misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway (Vashist et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	153	, 2001), Sar1p/COPII also sorts misfolded substrates into subdomains of the ER from which they are subsequently degraded.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	154	 How does the same machinery sort proteins into three distinct pathways? A common sorting mechanism for both correctly folded and misfolded membrane proteins presents a spatial problem because these classes must occupy distinct regions of the ER.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	155	 It is likely that additional targeting mechanisms coordinate with Sar1p/COPII to direct the proteins to ER exit or retention.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	156	 It appears that a primary distinction is made at the level of packaging into COPII vesicles; although correctly folded soluble and transmembrane proteins for secretory traffic and misfolded soluble ERAD substrates for ER-Golgi recycling degradative traffic are sorted into COPII vesicles, misfolded transmembrane ERAD substrates are excluded (Vashist et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	157	 There is evidence that transmembrane ERAD substrates are prevented from entry into COPII vesicles and are retained in the ER through the action of luminal ER proteins.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	158	 For example, mutants of the transmembrane ATPase Pma1p appear to be retained and degraded in the ER through the action of a protein disulfide isomerase to related protein, Eps1p (Wang and Chang, 1999).
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Similarly, the retention of a transmembrane H2a precursor in the ER is determined by a pentapeptide sequence present on the luminal side of the ER (Shenkman et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In addition, ERAD substrates can be retained by binding to calnexin.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	161	 It has been shown that calnexin binds to wild-type and folding compromised F508CFTR in the ER, but the association with F508CFTR is prolonged and might facilitate ER retention (Pind et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	162	 ERAD substrates can be also retained by association with the translocon (Loayza et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Cytoplasmic chaperones may also participate in ER retention (Brodsky et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The finding that strains inactivated in the cytosolic Hsp70 Ssa1p do not sort CFTR into ER subdomains supports the view that ER sequestration requires the coordinate action of Sar1p/COPII and accessory factors.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	165	That Sar1p/COPII is likely to participate in the secretory and the degradative pathways is supported by data obtained from whole genome microarray analysis where many genes involved in secretory traffic were found to be UPR targets (Travers et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Initially, the up-regulation was viewed as means to increase traffic in the ER-Golgi recycling degradative pathway for soluble ERAD substrates (Caldwell et al.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, our work suggests that the up-regulation is also a means to increase components required for ER sequestration of transmembrane ERAD substrates.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Specifically relevant to our analysis is the up-regulation of SEC12, SEC13, and SEC24.
0.57130253.12538638.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Thus, it may be that the UPR-mediated up-regulation of these genes may not be a cellular strategy to remove protein from the ER by exporting them, but additionally might promote sorting of retained proteins toward degradation.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	6	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel whose phosphorylation regulates both channel gating and its trafficking at the plasma membrane.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Cysteine string proteins (Csps) are J-domain-containing, membrane-associated proteins that have been functionally implicated in regulated exocytosis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Therefore, we evaluated the possibility that Csp is involved in regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We found Csp expressed in mammalian epithelial cell lines, several of which express CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In Calu-3 airway cells, immunofluorescence colocalized Csp with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum and with CFTR at the apical membrane domain.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Csp associated with both core-glycosylated immature and fully glycosylated mature CFTRs (bands B and C); however, in relation to the endogenous levels of the B and C bands expressed in Calu-3 cells, the Csp interaction with band B predominated.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In vitro protein binding assays detected physical interactions of both mammalian Csp isoforms with the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus, having submicromolar affinities.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, Csp overexpression decreased the chloride current and membrane capacitance increases evoked by cAMP stimulation and decreased the levels of CFTR protein detected by immunoblot.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In mammalian cells, the steady-state expression of CFTR band C was eliminated, and pulse-chase studies showed that Csp coexpression blocked the conversion of immature to mature CFTR and stabilized band B.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These results demonstrate a primary role for Csp in CFTR protein maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The physical interaction of this Hsc70-binding protein with immature CFTR, its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the decrease in production of mature CFTR observed during Csp overexpression reflect a role for Csp in CFTR biogenesis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The documented role of Csp in regulated exocytosis, its interaction with mature CFTR, and its coexpression with CFTR at the apical membrane domain of epithelial cells may reflect also a role for Csp in regulated CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis, whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway produces secretory diarrhea.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The folding of CFTR is energetically complex; misfolding and degradation of the protein are features of the most common CFTR mutation (F508) (2, 3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, F508 CFTR is unable to undergo ATP-dependent conformational changes in the ER that are required for its proper folding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	24	 When CFTR folding is retarded in the ER, the protein becomes a target for proteolysis by ER-associated degradation mechanisms that police the protein secretory pathway for misfolded or incompletely complexed proteins (4).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This degradation involves ubiquitination of the aberrant protein and its delivery to the proteasome (5, 6).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Nearly all of the F508 CFTR produced by the cell is destroyed in this manner; and because of its complex folding pattern, much of the wild-type protein is also degraded.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The mechanisms that govern CFTR folding/degradation processes are facilitated by chaperone and co-chaperone protein interactions (discussed further below).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	28	The primary step in CFTR activation involves cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of its central regulatory (R) domain, which not only permits the channel to gate, but also alters pathways for CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane (7).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In recent years, protein interactions at several CFTR domains have been implicated in channel function and trafficking.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The N-terminal cytosolic tail of CFTR is a site of syntaxin 1A binding (8), and syntaxin 1A overexpression is thought to inhibit CFTR currents by reducing channel gating (9) and by interfering with regulated CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane (10).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	31	 A motif promoting CFTR endocytosis has been identified at the C terminus, and this region interacts physically with the plasma membrane endocytic adapter (AP-2) complex (11, 12).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The C terminus of CFTR corresponds to a PDZ (PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1) binding motif, which interacts with ezrin radixin moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 or E3KARP to bring ezrin into proximity with CFTR (13, 14).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Ezrin can anchor protein kinase A at a position physiologically appropriate for CFTR phosphorylation (15, 16), and ezrin interactions with the cytoskeleton permit retention of CFTR at the apical membrane as a mechanism to establish its polarity in epithelial cells (17).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Here, we report the interaction of CFTR with another multidomain protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	35	The Csps were first discovered in Drosophila and Torpedo (18, 19), and their expression has now been documented in a variety of tissues from several mammalian species (20, 21).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Csp null mutants in Drosophila produce a temperature-sensitive block of synaptic transmission followed by paralysis and premature death.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These findings demonstrate a crucial role for Csp in neurosecretion (22).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In neurons, Csp is associated predominantly with synaptic vesicles (19), and in secretory cells it is found in large dense core or secretory granules (23, 24).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Studies of membrane dye labeling (25) and neurotransmitter release (26, 27) indicated that Csp knockouts exhibit defective neurotransmitter exocytosis; presynaptic endocytosis and vesicle recycling appear to be intact.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed that altered Csp expression elicits an impaired secretory phenotype.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	41	Csps contain an N-terminal "J-domain," a central cysteine-rich "string" region, and a phylogenetically more variable C-terminal domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The J-domains of Csps are structurally conserved among different species, and this region provides a fingerprint of Csp as a member of the DnaJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein) chaperone family.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	43	 As observed for other chaperone proteins (29), the HPD motif of the Csp J-domain mediates its binding to and activation of the Hsc70 chaperone ATPases, which influence protein conformation/binding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Structural predictions indicate that the C terminus of Csp1 may form a coiled-coil region, and this structure may be important in view of the emerging evidence that Csp can interact with proteins involved in exocytosis, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein and syntaxins 1A and 4 (21, 30, 31).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Thus, prior results suggest that Csp could link functions of the SNARE complex with those of Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The concept that assembly of the core fusion complex requires chaperone activity has been raised previously (21); however, the explicit roles of Csp and Hsc70 in the assembly or disassembly of SNARE components are not yet known.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The C terminus of Csp contains the only primary structural difference that exists between the mammalian isoforms: full-length Csp1, and its C-terminal truncated variant, Csp2 (32, 33).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	48	Csp expression in epithelial cells has not been characterized previously.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We found that various mammalian epithelial cell lines express two Csp isoforms and that the expression of Csp1 predominated over that of Csp2.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In Calu-3 airway epithelial cells, Csp partially colocalized with CFTR in the ER and apical plasma membrane domains.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Csp coprecipitated with CFTR from Calu-3 cell lysates and bound selectively to the N terminus and R-domain of CFTR with high affinity.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Coexpression of Csp isoforms with CFTR inhibited the functional responses associated with its cAMP stimulation, and exogenous Csp expression decreased the production of mature CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These findings suggest that Csp is a CFTR-binding partner that can influence the biogenesis and trafficking of CFTR.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	292	 9A, the coexpression of either Csp1 or Csp2 with CFTR (lanes 3 and 4) eliminated the expression of mature, glycosylated CFTR (band C) and produced an accumulation of immature CFTR (band B).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	293	 This finding suggests that Csp overexpression interferes with the processing of CFTR to its mature form and that it stabilizes the immature form of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The effect of exogenous Csp on CFTR biogenesis is specific because the Csp2 double mutant (H43V/E93Q) eliminated its inhibitory effect on CFTR maturation (lane 5).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	295	 In other experiments, a similar result was obtained with the Csp2 single mutant, H43Q, implying that a functional J-domain is critical for the inhibitory effect of Csp overexpression.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	305	Because Csp is an Hsc70-binding protein, we examined the levels of Hsc70 by immunoblot under these conditions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	306	 As shown in the middle panel of Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	307	 9A, the effect of Csp1 or 2 on CFTR expression was not associated with a change in Hsc70 expression levels when this Hsc70-binding protein was expressed.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Thus, the failure of cells to express mature CFTR is not caused by a change in the expression of this important CFTR chaperone.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	309	 In addition, the specificity of the Csp effect for CFTR biogenesis was determined by coexpressing Csp with the VSV-G.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Csp coexpression did not affect the production of the mature VSV-G, in experiments performed in a manner similar to those with CFTR (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	311	 This result suggests that the effect of expressed Csp is specific for maturation of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	312	The effect of Csp on the steady-state expression of mature CFTR was supported by the results of pulse-chase assays.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	313	 10, Csp1 coexpression in HEK293 cells blocked the conversion of immature CFTR to mature CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	314	 As in prior studies (5), ~30% of wild-type CFTR matures to the fully glycosylated band C protein (lower panels); however, no band C was detected in Csp-coexpressing cells.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In addition, the half-life of immature CFTR was prolonged, consistent with the accumulation of band B observed in the steady-state data (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Similar effects on the biogenesis of mature CFTR resulted from the coexpression of Csp2 (data not shown).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	317	 With Csp coexpression, the rise in band B production at chase periods of 30 and 60 min is probably attributed to the lack of cold methionine and cysteine in the chase media; nevertheless, the experiments with CFTR alone were performed identically.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The results indicate that Csp interferes with CFTR biogenesis when Csp is overexpressed.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The implications of these findings for a physiological role of Csp in the production of CFTR will be discussed below.

0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	327	The results of this study show that Csp is expressed in a variety of epithelial cell lines, several of which are models for CFTR-mediated chloride secretion.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	328	 These cells expressed predominantly Csp1, as observed previously in neurons and secretory cells (21) (e.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Immunofluorescent labeling showed a membrane-limited distribution of Csp in ER and apical membrane compartments.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Significant amounts of CFTR coprecipitated with Csp from Calu-3 cell lysates; in protein binding assays, Csp associated with both the CFTR R-domain and the N terminus.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The overexpression of Csp decreased CFTR biogenesis, and it correspondingly reduced the functional response of CFTR to cAMP stimulation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	332	 These results indicate that Csp interacts physically and functionally with CFTR in epithelial cells.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This is the first report of an action of Csp on protein maturation, as discussed below.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	334	Role of Csp in Regulated Exocytosis-- Csp is expected to influence CFTR directly by virtue of its localization at the cytosolic surfaces of intracellular membranes that contain CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	335	 A defining feature of the Csps is their central cysteine-rich (string) domain, where palmitoylation at multiple sites permits Csp to associate with membrane lipid (49).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Immunofluorescence demonstrated that Csp is distributed in membrane-limited compartments, including the apical membrane domain, in Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	337	 The Csps were discovered in Drosophila, and from their cellular distribution and knockout studies, a role for these proteins in neurotransmitter secretion became apparent (18).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Studies in neuroendocrine (28) and endocrine cells (24) have confirmed the role of Csp in regulated exocytosis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Several studies have implicated a regulated exocytic event in the control of plasma membrane CFTR channel density (50).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	340	 In Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR, cAMP stimulation enhances the chloride current and elicits increases in membrane capacitance and cell surface CFTR labeling, consistent with cAMP-regulated insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane (10, 41, 51).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	341	 In adenovirus-transduced Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, CFTR was distributed in both intracellular and plasma membrane compartments under basal conditions and was recruited to the plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation (52).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	342	 The partial colocalization of Csp with CFTR at the apical membrane domain of Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	343	 2E) and its interaction with mature (band C) CFTR (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	344	 3A) is consistent with the concept that this protein may participate in post-Golgi CFTR trafficking events.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	345	 It will be interesting to determine whether Csp interacts with CFTR in a regulated trafficking compartment because this location would be consonant with the documented role of Csp in regulated exocytosis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	346	 To perform such studies, however, it will be necessary to obviate the influence of Csp on CFTR maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	347	A Role for Csp in CFTR Biogenesis-- We found Csp to be localized in airway epithelial cells in a compartment marked by the ER resident protein, calnexin.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that more of the core glycosylated, immature CFTR was associated with Csp than was the mature, fully glycosylated protein, particularly in proportion to the steady-state expression levels of the mature and immature forms of CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	349	 In addition, Csp coexpression reduced the production of mature CFTR, and this effect of Csp appears to require a functional J-domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	350	 These results imply that Csp and CFTR interact during CFTR biogenesis in the ER.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	351	 As a member of the DnaJ family of proteins, Csp could play a role in CFTR processing via its association with Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	352	 The DnaJ proteins can serve as co-chaperones that recruit Hsc70 ATPases to specific substrates, where they activate the ATPase activity of the chaperone to modulate protein conformation (folding) or protein-protein interactions (4, 29).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Hsc70 has long been recognized as a CFTR chaperone, which coprecipitates with CFTR in the presence of ATP (39).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Hsc70 has been shown to assist in preventing the aggregation of NBD1, the domain in which the common CFTR folding mutant, F508, is located (4, 53, 54).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Normally, wild-type CFTR will be released from chaperones as it achieves its native conformation, but Hsc70 is thought to remain attached to misfolded CFTR where it can recruit the ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, to facilitate proteosome-mediated CFTR degradation (40, 55).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	356	Csp is a J-domain protein that interacts with Hsc70 and enhances its ATPase activity (56).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	357	 The interaction of Csp with Hsc70 and CFTR is likely to affect CFTR processing in one of two ways.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	358	 First, Csp may be a CFTR co-chaperone that stabilizes intermediate forms of CFTR to promote their folding and maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	359	 This model suggests that Csp contributes positively to CFTR maturation, similar to the Hsc70 co-chaperone, Hdj-2 (53).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Second, Csp interactions with nonfolded CFTR intermediates may contribute to the degradation of nascent CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	361	 This model suggests that Csp may contribute to CFTR degradation, similar to the Hsc70-interacting protein, CHIP (see below).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Either model could explain how Csp overexpression reduces the steady-state expression levels of mature CFTR in mammalian cells or oocytes and therefore, the cAMP-stimulated CFTR currents (Figs.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	363	 In the first model, Csp overexpression causes a prolonged association of Hsc70 with CFTR, which can target CFTR for degradation (55).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Hsc70 has been shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of several cellular proteins (57).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	365	 For example, overexpression of Hsc70 leads to ubiquitination and degradation of apolipoprotein B (58).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Thus, a prolonged Csp-mediated association of CFTR with Hsc70, because of Csp overexpression, could lead to CFTR degradation, despite the possibility that the physiological role of Csp is to facilitate CFTR biogenesis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	367	The second model is trivial, in that augmenting the level of a protein involved in CFTR degradation would reduce CFTR expression.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Illustrative of this model is the Hsc70-binding protein CHIP, a ubiquitin ligase whose overexpression promotes proteasome-mediated CFTR degradation (40).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	369	 CHIP appears to recognize slowly folding or misfolded forms of CFTR and promotes their destruction by binding to CFTR-associated Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	370	 CHIP then targets CFTR to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	371	 The finding that proteosome inhibitors fail to promote trafficking of class II CFTR mutants suggests that mechanisms exist for irreversible targeting of protein to intracellular degradation processes before their cellular destruction.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	372	 CHIP appears to be a component of this pathway; in principle, Csp could function in this manner as well.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	373	Several findings favor the co-chaperone model.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	374	 First, the predominant interaction of Csp with CFTR band B in Calu-3 cells (Fig.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	375	 3) suggests a physiological role for Csp in the maturation of CFTR because the majority of the CFTR expressed in these cells is the fully glycosylated mature form.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Second, the direct interaction of Csp with CFTR subdomains in the absence of Hsc70 (Figs.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	377	 4 and 5) suggests that Csp may localize Hsc70 at specific sites to facilitate CFTR folding.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	378	 In contrast to CHIP (40), Csp does not require Hsc70 for its interaction with CFTR.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Third, Csp overexpression stabilized CFTR band B, which is contrary to the result expected for a protein that promotes degradation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Finally, previous data indicate a positive role for Csp in protein folding processes, also favoring the first model of Csp interaction.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	381	 As is true of other DnaJ proteins, Csp can bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation (49).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	382	 This activity is synergistic with the similar action of Hsc70.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Together, these findings suggest that Csp may serve as a co-chaperone during CFTR biogenesis.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	384	Csp Interactions with the N terminus and R-domain-- With regard to protein interactions that could regulate CFTR biogenesis, it is interesting that Csp has the capacity to bind to both the R-domain and the CFTR N terminus.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Previous studies implicate the N terminus as a site important for the normal processing of CFTR and suggest that interactions of the R-domain with other CFTR subdomains may facilitate its biogenesis (3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	386	 N-terminal truncations of CFTR are poorly processed, and little of the truncated protein is able to traffic to the plasma membrane.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	387	 In addition, several N-terminal disease mutations are processing mutants.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Several studies indicate that a pivotal point in CFTR synthesis is the generation of the R-domain.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Before synthesis of the R-domain, CFTR is unstable and is associated with chaperones to prevent NBD aggregation (53, 54).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Once the R-domain is formed, chaperone protein associations with CFTR decrease, and the nascent protein becomes more stable.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Other studies indicate that mutations near the N terminus of CFTR which lead ultimately to protein degradation are not recognized by the ER-associated degradation machinery until the R-domain is synthesized (3).
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	392	 This implies that degradation processes recognize structural interfaces between CFTR subdomains.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	393	 These interdomain effects may be mediated by specific co-chaperones that can interact with several CFTR subdomains to facilitate access of Hsc70 to intermediates in the folding pathway; Csp is a candidate for such interactions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	394	Finally, the discussion has focused primarily on CFTR biogenesis in the ER; however, it is possible also that the physiological action of Csp involves the trafficking of immature CFTR to post-ER compartments.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	395	 For example, Csp and CFTR could interact in the transition of CFTR to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or to proximal Golgi regions prior to CFTR glycosylation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	396	 The mechanistic involvement of Csp in such trafficking processes may parallel its action in regulated exocytic events (see discussion above), presumably exploiting its interaction with Hsc70 to facilitate trafficking protein interactions.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	397	 In addition, a nonconventional pathway for CFTR trafficking has been proposed recently (59, 60) involving direct transit from the ER to the trans-Golgi network, perhaps via an endosomal compartment.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Csp could be involved in these trafficking steps; however, the significance of their role in CFTR maturation was cell type-dependent, and the presence of this pathway in epithelial cells has not yet been demonstrated.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Further studies will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	400	Formerly, Csp has been implicated as an important component of the regulated exocytic machinery at the plasma membrane, and this was our rationale for examining Csp actions in relation to regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	401	 However, the principal findings of the present study demonstrate a primary role for Csp in CFTR protein maturation.
0.4726967.12039948.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Although Csp did not interact with the process of VSV-G maturation, it will be interesting to determine whether there are additional proteins whose biogenesis involves interactions with Csp.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received June 20, 1997; Revised and Accepted December 15, 1997.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	3	The in vivo transcription start sites of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) and its murine homologue (Cftr) have been mapped in a range of tissues using the technique of 5[prime] rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5[prime] RACE).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	4	 These are the first in vivo transcription start sites for CFTR or Cftr to be reported.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Distinct, tissue-specific patterns of CFTR start site usage were identified in both mouse and human.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In particular, striking variation in the position of the murine Cftr transcription start site was seen along the length of the intestinal tract; different start sites being utilized in ileum and in duodenum.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In humans, distinct transcription start sites are utilized in adult and foetal lungs.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, a novel 5[prime]-untranslated exon of murine Cftr, denoted exon -1, was identified and shown to be expressed exclusively in mouse testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Expression of exon -1-containing Cftr transcripts was shown by mRNA in situ hybridization to be confined to the germ cells and to be regulated during spermatogenesis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	10	Cystic fibrosis is a common, autosomal recessive disease characterized by intestinal blockages, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility and progressive, degenerative lung disease (1).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These diverse symptoms result from mutation of a single gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR (2,3), the product of which functions as a cAMP-regulated, low conductance chloride channel (4).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	12	CFTR exhibits complex patterns of tissue-specific expression being expressed at low levels in specialized epithelial cells of the intestinal crypts, airway submucosal glands, pancreatic ducts, sweat gland ducts and the male reproductive tract (5-8).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In addition, the observed patterns of expression indicate that CFTR expression is regulated by hormones (9) and during development and differentiation (8,10,11).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although the patterns of regulated CFTR gene expression are well known, surprisingly little is known of the genetic elements and transcription factors that regulate the tissue-specific expression of CFTR.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Both the mouse and human CFTR genes have promoters which resemble those of `housekeeping' genes (12-14), an observation that is inconsistent with the tissue and cell type specificity of CFTR expression.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	16	Knowledge of the position of the CFTR transcription start site utilized in CFTR-expressing cells in vivo is a prerequisite to understanding the regulation of the CFTR promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CFTR transcription start sites previously have only been mapped in a number of immortalized cell lines (12,13,15), and it cannot be concluded that identical sites are used in vivo.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the present study, we used a 5[prime] rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5[prime] RACE) approach to map accurately transcription start sites of human CFTR, and its murine homologue Cftr, in a range of primary tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Distinct tissue-specific patterns of transcription start site usage were observed.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The implications of these findings with regard to the regulation of CFTR expression are discussed.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	21	 RESULTS Identification of murine Cftr transcription start sites by 5[prime] RACE.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	22	In order to identify the major in vivo Cftr transcription start sites utilized in mouse primary tissues, we performed 5[prime] RACE on total RNA isolated from adult mouse lungs, ileum, duodenum, testis, uterus, kidney, and also 16-day-old foetal mouse lungs.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	23	 First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a Cftr-specific primer (MC6R; Table 1).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	24	 cDNAs were then homopolymer tailed and subjected to two successive rounds of hemi-nested PCR amplification with anchor primer complementary to the homopolymer tail and Cftr-specific nested primers (MC5R and MC2.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Discrete 5[prime] RACE products were amplified from each mouse tissue (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	26	 1 shows representative experiments).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These 5[prime] RACE products were excised and either sequenced directly or cloned into the vector pT7 blue (Novagen) and then sequenced.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The positions of the observed transcription initiation sites, numbered relative to the A of the initiating methionine codon of the Cftr open reading frame (ORF) at position +1, are shown schematically in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Single, major transcription start sites were observed for mouse adult lung (-82), kidney (-75), uterus (-72) and 16-day-old mouse foetal lung (-72).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Variation in Cftr transcription start site usage was seen along the length of the mouse intestinal tract; two start sites were observed in mouse duodenum (-60 and -19), whereas two different major start sites were mapped in mouse ileum (-72 and -75) corresponding to the most abundant 5[prime] RACE products amplified from this tissue (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition to the major start sites, a number of minor transcription start sites were observed in the ileum, kidney and uterus.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The minor 5[prime] RACE products from the ileum were isolated and found to correspond to transcription start sites at positions +27, -216 and -255.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	44	As the Cftr transcription start sites were mapped by a PCR-based technique, where more than one start site was observed, no absolute values can be assigned to the percentage of transcript initiating at each of the sites.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, we can conclude that the most abundant products correspond to the major transcription start sites for Cftr and that, collectively, the minor 5[prime] RACE products constitute at most 10% of Cftr transcripts in any tissue.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Importantly, the two major start sites mapped in the ileum (-72 and -75) are used with approximately equal frequency while the two start sites mapped in the duodenum (-60 and -19) are used in an ~4:1 ratio, respectively.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Finally, the relative intensities of 5[prime] RACE products from foetal and adult lung correspond well with the known down-regulation of Cftr expression in adult mouse lung tissue (unpublished data).

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	50	A significant amount of tissue-specific variation in the pattern of Cftr transcription start site usage was observed in the mouse.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In order to investigate whether similar variation in CFTR transcription start site usage also occurs in human tissues, we performed 5[prime] RACE on RNA isolated from human whole small intestine, whole pancreas, whole adult lung and whole foetal lung (pooled from 29 specimens in the age range 18-28 weeks): these tissues represent the major sites of CFTR expression relevant to CF disease pathology.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	52	 First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a CFTR-specific primer (HC6R; Table 1).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	53	 cDNAs were then homopolymer tailed and subjected to two successive rounds of hemi-nested PCR amplification with an anchor primer complementary to the homopolymer tail and CFTR-specific nested primers (HC5R and either HC2R or HC3R; Table 1).

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Because of limited availability of human tissues, it has not been possible to determine whether these two alternative start sites represent variation in start site usage along the length of the human intestinal tract, as is the case with murine Cftr, or whether these alternative start sites are used in different CFTR-expressing cell types all along the length of the intestine [e.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The results of this in vivo transcription mapping study are broadly consistent with previously published data from immortalized cell lines in that the single transcription start sites utilized in adult lung (-69) and pancreas (-68) and one of the start sites identified in intestine (-69) are close to the major CFTR start site(s) mapped in the colonic epithelial adenocarcinoma cell lines T84, HT-29 and Caco-2 (12,13,15).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	70	 However, none of the multiple minor start sites observed in T84, HT-29 and Caco-2 cells appear to be used in CFTR-expressing cells in vivo.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	71	The observation that distinct CFTR transcription start sites are utilized in adult (-69) and foetal lungs (-132) is intriguing given the previously reported developmental regulation of CFTR expression in the lung (10,11,18).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	72	 CFTR mRNA levels are substantially higher in foetal lungs than in adult lungs, with CFTR expression declining dramatically after birth, although the precise age at which this down-regulation occurs is not known.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	73	 It is possible that a switch in transcription initiation from the -132 site to the -69 site correlates with a particular stage in lung development.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A correlation between the pattern of CFTR transcription start site usage and the level of CFTR mRNA expression previously has been reported in CFTR-expressing cell lines, suggesting that a mechanism of CFTR regulation operates at the level of start site selection (15).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	75	 These data suggest that a similar mechanism might operate during human lung development.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Nevertheless, the existence of a human equivalent of the testis-specific murine Cftr exon -1 was investigated by performing 5[prime] RACE PCR in order to identify the CFTR transcription start site utilized in adult human testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The 5[prime] RACE procedure was repeated a total of three times, but no CFTR-specific product bands could be amplified.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	108	 As a positive control, CFTR expression in human testis was confirmed by RT-PCR using an internal CFTR primer set (not shown).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It was concluded, therefore, that the level of CFTR expression in human testis is extremely low but detectable by RT-PCR, but that this low level expression is below the limit of detection by 5[prime] RACE due to the latter method's inherently lower sensitivity.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Thus, the position of the CFTR start site utilized in adult human testis remains unknown, and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the expression of a human equivalent of murine Cftr exon -1 in human testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	111	In this study, we have mapped the in vivo transcription start sites for human CFTR and its murine homologue Cftr.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Using a sensitive 5[prime] RACE technique, we were able to map CFTR start sites in a number of different mouse and human tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	113	 These are the first in vivo CFTR transcription start sites to be mapped for any species.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	114	In the case of murine Cftr, the use of distinct, tissue-specific transcription start sites leads to the production of Cftr transcripts which differ in the length of their 5[prime]-untranslated regions (5[prime] UTRs).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The observation that distinct transcription start sites are used in different tissues suggests that the tissue-specific regulation of Cftr expression may, in part, operate at the level of transcription start site selection.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Analysis of the primary sequence of the 5[prime]-flanking region of murine Cftr provides some clues as to how tissue-specific start site selection might be achieved.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	117	 No sequence likely to correspond to a TATA box element could be found upstream of any of the in vivo transcription start sites identified for murine Cftr (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, Table 4 illustrates that sequences surrounding three of the Cftr transcription start sites, the -82 site utilized in lung and the -60 and -19 sites utilized in duodenum, are similar to the consensus sequence for the mammalian initiator (Inr) element, PyPyA(+1)N(T/A)PyPy, that has been suggested to maintain the fidelity of transcription initiation in promoters devoid of TATA boxes (24).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is likely, therefore, that an Inr-dependent mechanism is responsible for directing the formation of a transcription pre-initiation complex in these tissues.

0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	122	Tissue-specific variation in the position of the CFTR start site was also observed in human tissues.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Most notably, distinct start sites appear to be used in adult and in foetal lungs.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, the exact position of the CFTR transcription start site relative to the translation initiation codon does not appear to be conserved between equivalent tissues of mice and humans, suggesting that the precise mechanisms responsible for correct start site selection are not conserved cross-species.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	125	 This is perhaps not surprising given the apparent lack of primary nucleic acid sequence homology between the mouse and human proximal promoter regions (19,25).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	126	The identification of a testis-specific, untranslated exon of murine Cftr (exon -1) implies that Cftr expression in this tissue is under the control of a testis-specific alternative promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Murine Cftr falls into a group of genes demonstrating cell type-specific expression in the testis, with expression being regulated during spermatogenesis (22).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Other genes in this group include many whose protein products are thought to play a particular role in the complex process of spermatogenesis (reviewed in 26), and a potential role for the Cftr chloride channel during spermatogenesis has been suggested (22).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Genes such as Cftr that are expressed both post-meiotically in the testis and in other tissues often produce testis-specific transcripts, generated by the use of testis-specific promoters, altered polyadenylation and/or tissue-specific alternative exon splicing (26).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We have shown that the testis-specific Cftr transcript is generated through the use of an alternative promoter and alternative splicing in the 5[prime] UTR, to include exon -1 at the extreme 5[prime] end of the transcript.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The vast majority (95%) of Cftr transcripts in mouse testis contain this additional untranslated exon, implying an important role for exon -1 with regard to either the function of Cftr in testis or the regulation of Cftr expression in this tissue.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The latter alternative would appear to be more plausible as a number of genes expressed post-meiotically in rodent testis exhibit negative translational regulation mediated by the binding of regulatory proteins to specific 5[prime] UTR sequences (reviewed in 27).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	133	 One of the families of germ cell-specific proteins proposed to mediate translational regulation in the testis are the Y-box proteins (28).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Y-box proteins may function both as DNA-binding transcription factors, which bind to specific, cis-acting Y-box promoter elements, and as RNA-binding proteins, which mediate translational regulation via mRNA masking in vertebrate gametes (29).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In this context, it is interesting to note that a Y-box consensus sequence, previously suggested to act as a positive regulator of transcription in the murine Cftr promoter (14), is contained within exon -1 and thus will be present exclusively in the 5[prime] UTR of testis-specific Cftr transcripts.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	136	Another feature of the murine Cftr 5[prime]-flanking region suggests that translational regulation may be a more general mechanism controlling Cftr expression.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	137	 An additional AUG codon is present at position -58, upstream of the Cftr ORF (Fig.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This upstream AUG precedes a short upstream ORF (uORF) that, if recognized by the translation machinery, would produce a small peptide of five amino acids in length.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This uORF will be present in the 5[prime] UTR of Cftr transcripts initiating upstream of position -58, including the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lung, foetal lung, ileum, kidney, uterus and testis.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The upstream AUG occurs in a weak Kozak context, with neither the critical purine at position -3 nor the G at position +4 being present (30), whereas the AUG of the Cftr ORF occurs in a much stronger Kozak context (31).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The scanning model predicts that translation will usually initiate at the first AUG in a favourable Kozak context (30).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Nevertheless, interaction between the translation machinery and the upstream AUG may have the effect of reducing the translation efficiency of the Cftr ORF.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The presence of the short uORF would therefore be predicted to reduce the translation efficiency of the major Cftr transcripts expressed in lungs, ileum and testis but not those expressed in duodenum, as the uORF is absent from the 5[prime] UTR of the duodenum transcript initiating at position -19 and is too close to the m7G cap site to exert an effect in the transcript initiating at position -60 (31).
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Thus, by the use of distinct transcription start sites, the expression of Cftr might also be modulated at the translational level.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	145	The identification of the major Cftr transcription start sites utilized in vivo is an essential prerequisite to understanding the function of the Cftr promoter.
0.4301281.9466991.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It will now be possible to define the promoter elements, transcription factors and mechanisms directing the complex patterns of in vivo Cftr expression.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is a small conductance chloride ion channel that may interact directly with other channels including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	5	 CFTR is known to be more abundant in the airway epithelium during the second trimester of human development than after birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This could be a consequence of the change in function of the respiratory epithelium from chloride secretion to sodium absorption near term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Alternatively it might reflect an additional role for CFTR in the developing airway epithelium.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Though the lung epithelia of CF fetuses and infants rarely show gross histological abnormalities, there is often evidence of inflammation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Our aim was to establish whether CFTR expression levels correlated with specific developmental stages or differentiated functions in the ovine fetal lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We evaluated CFTR expression using a quantitative assay of mRNA at 14 time points through gestation and showed highest levels at the start of the second trimester followed by a gradual decline through to term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, ENaC expression increased from the start of the third trimester.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These results support a role for CFTR in differentiation of the respiratory epithelium and suggest that its expression levels are not merely reflecting major changes in the sodium/chloride bulk flow close to term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These observations may have significant implications for the likely success of CF gene therapy in the postnatal lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encodes a small conductance cAMP-activated chloride ion channel (1).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CFTR protein is located primarily in the apical membranes of epithelial cells within the respiratory and digestive systems.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	16	 About 1000 disease-associated mutations have been defined in the CFTR gene (www.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	17	ca) and the majority are associated with characteristic airway disease, pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility and elevated levels of sodium chloride in sweat.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	18	 It is difficult to explain how mutations in a single small-conductance epithelial chloride channel cause the pleiotropic manifestations of this disease, though a complex picture is now emerging in which CFTR interacts directly or indirectly with additional proteins.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	19	 CFTR is known to regulate other ion channels including the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (2) and the volume-activated chloride channel (3).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	20	 CFTR may also be involved in other cellular processes, for example, membrane recycling (4,5) and apoptosis (6,7).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	21	Relatively little attention has been given to progression of CF disease in utero though this affects postnatal pathology and may be of relevance to the likely success of gene therapy.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The initial pathology of CF is exhibited in the pancreas in the early second trimester of gestation, when proteinaceous material starts to obstruct the ductal tree (8,9).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This is perhaps not surprising since CFTR is expressed in epithelia from before the start of the second trimester of human development and CFTR expression levels are high in the mid-trimester pancreas (10 to 12).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In most tissues the CFTR expression levels show little fluctuation between the second trimester of gestation and postnatal life.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, CFTR appears to be developmentally regulated in both human and sheep lung epithelium (11 to 13) where high expression levels during fetal life are in contrast to much lower abundance of CFTR mRNA by birth, and into adulthood.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The significance of this down-regulation of CFTR expression is the major focus of this work.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	27	Since it is not feasible to investigate human lung development in utero, we have used the sheep to provide a useful model of human lung development (14).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The sheep lung is anatomically more similar to human than that of the mouse, having submucosal glands throughout the cartilagenous airway.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The expression pattern of CFTR in sheep is similar to humans, both temporally and spatially and we have shown that the ovine CFTR gene sequence shows close homology to the human gene (14,15).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Expression of CFTR during human and sheep lung development has so far been assessed primarily by means of in situ hybridization (11,12), northern blotting (10,13) and reverse transcriptase to polymerase chain reaction (RT to PCR) (10,13).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	31	 CFTR expression levels are high in the lung during the second trimester of gestation and low postnatally.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To date, developmental expression of CFTR has only been examined at a limited number of time points and data have not been accurately quantitative.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our aim was to evaluate CFTR expression at specific time points throughout gestation using a real-time quantitative RT to PCR assay provided by TaqMan technology.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We have generated a developmental profile of CFTR mRNA in sheep with particular attention to the down-regulation of CFTR in the respiratory system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This profile has identified key gestational ages where CFTR expression is maximal and hence when targeting of potential in utero therapies might be of most benefit.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	36	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Semi-quantitative RT to PCR of CFTR In preliminary experiments CFTR expression during ovine gestation was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT to PCR.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Primers C2R and C2L (16) that span exon 13 of the CFTR cDNA were used to reverse transcribe and amplify CFTR from RNA samples extracted from ovine tissues at 52, 66, 83, 94, 108, 129 and 143 days gestation, 147 (term) days and 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Subunit c of the ovine ATP synthase (17) was used as a reference standard for these RT to PCR reactions.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The developmental profile of CFTR mRNA in lung tissue (Fig.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	40	 1) shows a decline between 83 days of gestation (mid-trimester) and term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Since semi-quantitative RT to PCR has limited power in providing accurate data on relative expression levels of a gene, we then used real-time (TaqMan) RT to PCR to quantify the precise developmental expression of ovine CFTR in the lung.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	48	  Validation of the real-time CFTR RT to PCR assay target The region of the ovine CFTR gene chosen for generating the TaqMan amplifying primers and probe covered the boundary between exons 6a and 6b.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Since the CFTR gene is known to exhibit a range of alternatively spliced forms in a number of species (18) it was necessary to confirm that no aberrant transcripts lacking parts of exons 6a and 6b were produced from the ovine gene.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Conventional RT to PCR was carried out using primers spanning exons 4 to 7 and no alternative transcripts lacking exons 6a or 6b were detected in RNA from lung at mid-gestation or birth, pancreas, small intestine, salivary gland and colon at 2 days after birth (data not shown).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These results suggested that the real-time TaqMan RT to PCR assay targeted to the exon 6a/6b boundary, would accurately reflect total CFTR mRNA transcription.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	52	Real-time RT to PCR for CFTR mRNA in ovine fetal tissues The real-time RT to PCR assay for ovine CFTR mRNA was optimized and its reproducibility established.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Values obtained from reactions in which template was omitted, consistently fell below the range of the standard curve and were  < 0.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Standard curves were highly reproducible for the ovine CFTR and ribosomal RNA assays (R2 = 0.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	55	99) and genomic contribution to the RT to PCR reactions was  < 0.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	56	Two series of experiments were performed: the first evaluated CFTR expression in ovine lung tissues throughout the developmental time course; the second evaluated CFTR expression in eight ovine tissues at 83 and 108 days of gestation and at 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	57	Developmental expression of ovine CFTR in the lung The developmental profile of CFTR expression in the lung showed a gradual fall in mRNA levels though the 147 days of gestation (Fig.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Values at 52 days of gestation, the end of the first trimester, were 75-fold higher than those at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	59	 By 66 days, CFTR mRNA levels were reduced 4.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	61	 After levels peaked at 80 days of gestation, there was a gradual decline toward birth with negligible levels of expression by 4 days before term (143 days) and at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Two days after parturition, levels of CFTR mRNA increased slightly and this expression level was maintained at 2 weeks of age and in adult sheep tissue.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	85	 They confirm the observation that the levels of CFTR mRNA in the pancreas and digestive system are significantly higher (at least 5-fold) than in the lung epithelium even at the time of maximal expression in the respiratory system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The observation of greater levels of CFTR mRNA in the colon than in the small intestine is probably a unique feature of the sheep and its digestive system as there are data to show the opposite distribution in the human intestine (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Glandular organs such as pancreas, lung and salivary gland had a similar pattern of expression characterized by higher expression early in gestation followed by a decline towards birth with levels maintained 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	88	 CFTR mRNA levels were higher in both pancreas and salivary gland than in lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In trachea CFTR mRNA levels were comparable to values in lung during gestation but rose at 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Small intestine expressed lower levels of CFTR mRNA before birth in comparison to 2 days after birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Colon initially expressed very high amounts of CFTR mRNA, which then decreased slightly at mid-gestation before rising again to a high level after birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	92	 CFTR mRNA expression in the ovine kidney is very low and declines between 83 and 2 days post-term.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	93	Developmental expression of ovine ENaC in the lung The CFTR and ENaC ion channels are thought to interact directly (2), hence it was pertinent to evaluate also the developmental expression of ENaC in the ovine lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	94	 These assays were performed using conventional RT to PCR rather than real-time TaqMan RT to PCR due to lack of full sequence information for ovine ENaC and reported alternative splicing of this gene (19).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In marked contrast to CFTR, expression of the subunit of ENaC is very low in the ovine lung at 52 days of gestation, but gradually rises through 108, 129, 143 and 147 (term) days of gestation to much higher levels in 2 days post-term and adult lung (Fig.

0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	103	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We have shown using semi-quantitative and quantitative RT to PCR that the high levels of CFTR expression seen in the second trimester ovine fetal lung decrease gradually through to term rather than declining suddenly near parturition.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The detection of significant CFTR expression during lung development with low levels after birth confirms previous observations in humans and sheep (11 to 13).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	105	 (13) showed, by RT to PCR and northern blots, that CFTR mRNA expression in ovine fetal lung was far higher than after birth and into adulthood, and that the high levels seen at 70 days of ovine gestation were comparable to CFTR mRNA in mid-trimester human fetuses.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	106	However, the previous data did not evaluate CFTR expression throughout gestation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The gradual decline in CFTR that we observed during ovine fetal lung development could be accounted for by at least two explanations.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Either, the percentage of cells that express CFTR within the lung epithelium decrease with time or the levels of expression within the same cell type gradually decreases.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	109	 On the basis of previous data we would expect the former explanation to be correct.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In postnatal human lung epithelium significant CFTR expression is limited to specific cells within the serous portion of submucosal glands and individual cells in the airway surface epithelium (20,21).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This is in contrast to the apparent expression of CFTR mRNA in the majority of cells in the fetal lung epithelium (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Furthermore, in human trachea, CFTR expression was seen to be intermediate and diffuse during the first trimester by in situ hybridization (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In the second trimester, CFTR mRNA expression was reduced and limited to a subset of cells in the epithelia of the trachea and by the third trimester, only individual cells expressed CFTR but at very high levels (12).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	114	High levels of CFTR mRNA expression have been observed by in situ hybridization in pancreas, small intestine and colon from an early gestational age in humans (11).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	115	 These expression levels remain constant throughout gestation in contrast to lung expression patterns.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The temporal and spatial expression of CFTR mRNA in ovine small intestine, pancreas, colon, salivary gland and kidney and muscle seen in our experiments, closely parallel the human gene (13).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, the quantitative assays show that in contrast to the human CFTR gene, which is expressed at a higher level in the crypts of the small intestine than in the colon, ovine CFTR mRNA is most abundant in the colonic epithelium.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This may reflect functional differences in the ruminant digestive system.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	119	 It is of interest that the decline of CFTR expression observed in ovine fetal lung between 83 days gestation and 2 days after birth is also seen in pancreas and salivary gland.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	120	 CFTR may have a significant role in the development and differentiation of other glandular tissues.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	121	The physiological implications of the gradual decline in lung CFTR expression levels during gestation warrant further discussion.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The fetal lung is filled with a high chloride, low pH fluid that is distinct from amniotic fluid.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Chloride is actively secreted from the lung epithelium into the lung lumen during development and as a chloride ion channel, CFTR protein could contribute to this process.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, chloride conductances other than CFTR are likely to be more important in fetal lung fluid secretion since CF is not associated with hypoplastic lungs at birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Furthermore, the profile of CFTR expression during gestation does not correspond to changes in lung liquid secretion (22,23).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	126	Postnatally, the major ion flows across the airway epithelium are uptake of sodium.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Lung liquid begins to be reabsorbed by ovine lung epithelium at 140 days of gestation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Sodium reabsorption is achieved primarily by sodium channels located on the apical surface of the lung epithelium, the main one being the ENaC (24).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Recent data have shown that ENaC is inhibited by CFTR, which probably interacts directly with it (2,25,26).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The gradual decline in CFTR mRNA levels and protein would be compatible with enabling ENaC activity.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Furthermore, we have shown that the abundance of ENaC transcripts is inversely proportional to the levels of CFTR mRNA in the developing ovine lung after the second trimester, hence the expression of the genes encoding these two ion channels may be also coordinately regulated.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	132	An additional possibility is that CFTR expression in the fetal lung epithelium has an important, as yet undefined functional role in normal lung development.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Though at birth lung pathology is not usually evident in CF, absence of functional CFTR protein in the developing lung has been reported to produce a pro-inflammatory state (27).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Increased levels of interleukin-8 were observed in the airway surface fluid of human CF fetal tracheal grafts implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Though this apparent pro-inflammatory state of the epithelia did not result directly in histological abnormalities, challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa provoked an exaggerated immune response resulting in sloughing of epithelial cells and increased leukocyte activity, thereby increasing likelihood of further bacterial colonization (27).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	136	The high levels of CFTR expression early in gestation may correspond to an important function of CFTR protein unique to this developmental stage.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The periods of high and low CFTR expression that we have defined, correspond to distinct developmental phases in the sheep lung.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Relatively high levels of CFTR mRNA expression are observed during the pseudoglandular phase (between 40 and 80 days of sheep gestation) when the bronchial tree and acini form.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	139	 During the developmental progression to the canalicular phase (80 to 120 days of gestation) when differentiation into type I and II epithelial cells occurs, CFTR mRNA levels begin to decline, and remain low until birth.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	140	 (28) have shown that overexpression of CFTR in the lungs of wild-type mice, at 15 to 16 days (corresponding to the late pseudoglandular and early canalicular developmental stages), advanced epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Furthermore, the same investigators suggested that transient expression of CFTR in CF mice following intramniotic injection of adeno-CFTR cDNA at 15 to 16 days of mouse gestation, corrected the lethal intestinal disease (29).
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The expression profile of CFTR in the developing sheep lung is consistent with data from the mouse that suggest a crucial role for CFTR in lung epithelial maturation.
0.45434183.11809721.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These observations may have important implications for current attempts to treat CF airway disease by postnatal gene therapy.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	5	Application of differential display to cultured rat astrocytes subjected to hypoxia allowed cloning of a novel cDNA, termed stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Expression of SERP1 was enhanced in vitro by hypoxia and/or reoxygenation or other forms of stress, causing accumulation of unfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and in vivo by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The SERP1 cDNA encodes a 66 to amino acid polypeptide which was found to be identical to ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) and bearing 29% identity to yeast suppressor of SecY 6 protein (YSY6p), suggesting participation in pathways controlling membrane protein biogenesis at ER.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In cultured 293 cells subjected to ER stress, overexpression of SERP1/RAMP4 suppressed aggregation and/or degradation of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins, and subsequently, facilitated their glycosylation when the stress was removed.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	9	 SERP1/RAMP4 interacted with Sec61 and Sec61ss, which are subunits of translocon, and a molecular chaperon calnexin.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These results suggest that stabilization of membrane proteins in response to stress involves the concerted action of a rescue unit in the ER membrane comprised of SERP1/RAMP4, other components of translocon, and molecular chaperons in ER.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	14	ISCHEMIC stress, due to hypoxemia alone or hypoxemia followed by reperfusion, is one of the most relevant environmental challenges, as it accompanies a spectrum of disorders associated with vascular dysfunction and aging.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The central nervous system typifies complexities of the cellular response to ischemia.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	16	 During ischemia itself, neuronal function is compromised, often resulting in loss of cell viability, due at least in part to the extracellular accumulation of excitatory amino acids and disordered calcium homeostasis (Choi 1995 ; Rothman and Olney 1995 ).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Subsequent reperfusion exacerbates injury through the formation of reactive oxygen species, which attack membranous and proteinaceous cellular constituents, further compromising their functions (McCord 1987 ; Solenski et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The cellular response to such ischemia occurs on many levels, including modulation of gene expression.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In this context, >80 different mRNAs have been identified in ischemic brain (for review see Koistinaho and Hokfelt 1997 ), and these encode proximal and distal regulators of the cellular stress response, immediate-early gene products, apoptosis-associated proteins, stress proteins, cytokines, and growth factors.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although some of these undoubtedly contribute to pathways underlying neuronal death, others most probably represent adaptive responses promoting cellular survival in response to stress.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	21	In contrast to the extraordinary vulnerability of neurons to ischemic stress, astrocytes have a unique ability to tolerate and even proliferate under such conditions, assigning them a central role in the immediate cellular response and later events associated with tissue remodelling (Hertz 1982 ).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The potential of astrocytes to orchestrate events in the central nervous system triggered by ischemic stress has led us to analyze their response to hypoxia (H)1 and hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (R), using brain-derived rat astrocytes in order to simulate ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion, respectively (Hori et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We have found that astrocytes subjected to these environmental perturbations display upregulation of stress proteins (glucose-regulated protein [GRP] 78, GRP94, heat shock protein [HSP] 72, and heme oxygenase, type 1), and release the neurotrophic cytokine IL-6 (Maeda et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Further dissection of differential gene expression in astrocytes exposed to H/R allowed cloning of three novel cDNAs encoding: (a) a novel stress protein, oxygen-regulated protein (ORP) 150; (b) the rat homologue of the Drosophila splicing factor Tra2 (RA301); and (c) a novel vesicle transporter (RA410) (Matsuo et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	25	To further probe mechanisms through which astrocytes participate in the response to ischemic stress, we have cloned a novel stress-associated ER protein, termed SERP1, by differential display applied to primary cultures of astrocytes exposed to H.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Compared with homeostatic conditions, SERP1 expression is upregulated both in vivo and in vitro in response to H and R (including induction of brain ischemia), as well as under conditions associated with accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	27	 SERP1 was found to be identical to ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (RAMP4) and bearing ~30% homology to yeast suppressor of SecY 6 protein (YSY6p), suggesting participation in pathways controlling biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins at the ER.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In cultured 293 cells subjected to ER stress, overexpression of SERP1/RAMP4 suppressed aggregation and/or degradation of integral membrane proteins under stress and facilitates glycosylation after the stress.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	29	 SERP1/RAMP4 interacted directly with Sec61 and Sec61ss, which are subunits of the translocon (Sec61 complex; Gorlich et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	30	 1992 ; Gorlich and Rapoport 1993 ), and calnexin, a membrane protein and a molecular chaperon in ER that associates with folding intermediates of glycoprotein (Ou et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Immunoprecipitation did demonstrate a binding of newly synthesized integral membrane proteins to Sec61 and Sec61ss but not to SERP1/RAMP4.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These results suggest that the stabilization of membrane proteins in response to stress involves the concerted action of a rescue unit in the ER membrane that appears to be comprised of SERP1/RAMP4, as well as other components of translocon, and molecular chaperons in ER.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Transient transfection of cultures with pcDNA3/RAGE followed by treatment of cells with tunicamycin (Figure 5 a) or A23187 (data not shown) resulted in trapping of RAGE in the ER followed by degradation.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Similar results were observed when CD8 was overexpressed and cultures were treated with these drugs.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Intracellular levels of RAGE were analyzed by immunoblotting (Figure 5 b) and metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation (Figure 5 c).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	196	 293 cells overexpressing RAGE and exposed to tunicamycin or A23187 showed a decrease in the amount of RAGE antigen (~58 and 36%, respectively, compared with quiescent cultures; Mr ~55 kD in glycosylated form and 52 kD in unglycosylated form), as well as a poorly defined smear of RAGE immunoreactivity in the upper portion of the membrane, the latter likely due to aggregation of RAGE (Figure 5 b, lanes 2 and 3), and/or several more rapidly migrating immunoreactive bands, consistent with the occurrence of degradation (Figure 5 b, lane 3).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-RAGE antibody followed by Western blotting with antiubiquitin antibody showed that the smear of RAGE immunoreactivity includes polyubiquitinated RAGE (data not shown).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Although cotransfection of quiescent 293 cells with pcDNA3/RAGE and pcDNA3/SERP1/RAMP4 had no apparent effect on RAGE antigen (Figure 5 b, lane 4), overexpression of SERP1/RAMP4 in tunicamycin- or A23187-treated cultures increased the intensity of the major RAGE band to ~80 and 86% of the intensity in untreated controls, respectively.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	224	 SERP1/RAMP4 overexpression had no detectable effect on the glycosylation of RAGE in the presence of tunicamycin (Figure 5b and Figure c).

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	226	 These effects of SERP1/RAMP4 overexpression during and after the stress were not due to induction of the OST complex, the enzymes that are required for (N-linked) glycosylation (data not shown).

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	246	A key facet of the cellular response to the environmental stress imposed by oxygen deprivation appears to be induction of molecular chaperons.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In this context, previous studies from our and other laboratories have demonstrated induction of molecular chaperons in ER, GRP78, GRP94, and a novel 150-kD polypeptide termed ORP150 (Lowenstein et al.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	250	 1999 ), suggesting that a stress response in ER might have a important role in adaptation to ischemic challenge.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The current studies describe another polypeptide, SERP1, whose expression is increased by H/R although the induction is preceded by those of molecular chaperons in ER, and which participates in the ER stress response due to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	252	SERP1 encodes a polypeptide localized to the ER and comprised of only 66 amino acids, which was identical to RAMP4.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	256	 The orientation of SERP1/RAMP4 in the ER is likely to present the NH2 terminus to the cytosol, as predicted by previous studies of other similar proteins (Hartmann et al.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Cotransfection of 293 cells to overexpress SERP1/RAMP4 prevented accelerated aggregation and degradation of RAGE and CD8 in the setting of ER stress (Figure 5b and Figure c).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Although it is not yet clear whether these effects of SERP1/RAMP4 occurred by directly preventing the degradation of membrane proteins or by promoting their refolding in the ER, our results support the latter concept, because SERP1/RAMP4 did facilitate, at least in part, glycosylation of integral membrane proteins in the ER after ER stress was relieved (Figure 5 d) without induction of the OST.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	264	Co-IP and cross-linking studies revealed that SERP1/RAMP4 interacts with the Sec61 and Sec61ss subunits, which bind to RAGE (and by analogy, other membrane proteins) in response to cellular perturbation (Figure 6, a to e).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	265	 It is important to note that SERP1/RAMP4 is likely to interact with other ER proteins in addition to Sec61 and Sec61ss, as indicated by the presence of several bands after immunoblotting of SERP1/RAMP4 after cross-linking (Figure 6 b).
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	266	 However, in a previous cross-linking study, RAMP4 was not detected in a complex with Sec61ss (Kalies et al.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	267	 We speculate that the reason for this difference with our results is likely to derive from the use of different cross-linking agents.

0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Together these results suggest that the stabilization of membrane proteins during and after ER stress involves the concerted action of a rescue unit in the ER membrane comprised of SERP1/RAMP4, components of the translocon such as Sec61 and Sec61ss, and ER chaperons, such as calnexin.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	271	Increased expression of components of the Sec61 complex begins relatively late during H (>12 h) and is sustained during R.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This suggests that induction of the Sec61 complex probably has an integral role for increased biosynthesis of luminal and membrane proteins in replacement of those damaged during stress.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	273	 It is noteworthy that expression of SERP1/RAMP4 parallels that of components of the Sec61 complex and not that of luminal ER chaperons, which declines during R.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	274	 This may indicate that the functions of the Sec61 complex and SERP1/RAMP4 during de novo protein synthesis are tightly coupled.
0.4653881.10601334.html.plaintext.txt	275	 These considerations underline the importance of further studies to determine the detailed function of SERP1/RAMP4 in the context of cell stress, and the contribution of SERP1/RAMP4 to cellular processing of native polypeptides or disease-related proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (Bebok et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In contrast to Sar1-GDP, Sar1-GTP is a dominant-negative mutant that promotes cargo collection into stable COPII-coated intermediates.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	83	 This result raises the possibility that recruitment of CFTR to the assembling COPII polymer at ER exit sites prevents access to ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	84	We also examined the effects of both Sar1-GDP to  and Sar1-GTP to restricted mutants on F508-CFTR stability given that this protein is not exported from the ER and therefore completely degraded by ERAD (Fig.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	97	  We conclude that conditions that enhance COPII assembly on the ER membrane stabilize wild-type CFTR from ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In contrast, conditions that interfere with COPII recruitment prevent the export of wild-type CFTR, but have little effect on delivery of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR to the ERAD pathway.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Thus, the ERAD pathway functions largely independently of the COPII machinery.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	100	Export, but not ERAD, is reversibly sensitive to a novel Sar1 temperature-sensitive (Sar1ts) mutant To ensure that the aforementioned results with the Sar1 mutants were not a consequence of targeting of either wild-type or mutant CFTR to a nonphysiological pathway, or reflect indirect effects of other cargo in the ER on CFTR export or stability, we developed a temperature-sensitive variant of Sar1.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This mutant is dominant-negative at the permissive temperature (32 degrees C), where it is folded properly.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	132	CFTR uses a di-acidic exit code for export from the ER To understand the requirement for COPII in the export of CFTR from the ER, we examined the CFTR sequence for the presence of the evolutionarily conserved tyrosine-based di-acidic code required for export of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	160	  To further characterize the biochemical properties of the DAA-CFTR mutant, we took advantage of the previous observation that treatment of CFTR-expressing cells with brefeldin A (BFA) reduces degradation of wild-type CFTR, but not F508-CFTR (Ostedgaard et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	161	 BFA triggers the collapse of the Golgi to the ER by preventing the recruitment of coat complex I to Golgi membranes (for review see Chardin and McCormick, 1999).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In contrast to its potent effect on coat complex I function in the Golgi, BFA has no effect on COPII function during ER export.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	163	 As a consequence, in BFA-treated cells ER-associated cargo is collected in export intermediates that accumulate in the absence of functional Golgi compartments (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	164	 As expected, addition of BFA prevented processing of wild-type CFTR from band B to C and partially stabilized wild-type CFTR from ERAD, likely reflecting recruitment to COPII intermediates (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In contrast, BFA did not prevent degradation of either the F508- or the DAA-CFTR mutant (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	166	 These results are consistent with the interpretation that both mutants fail to couple to the COPII machinery (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	168	The biochemical interaction of CFTR with COPII is disrupted by the F508 and DAA mutations Although the results described in the previous section raise the possibility that CFTR may exit the ER through the di-acidic code, it remained to be shown that wild-type CFTR can engage the COPII machinery and whether interaction with COPII can be disrupted by the F508- or DAA-CFTR mutations.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	169	 For this purpose, we first examined the ability of CFTR to bind the Sec23/Sec24 cargo selection complex in immunoprecipitates recovered from detergent lysates of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	170	 5 A, in cells expressing wild-type CFTR, the protein is largely in the band C mature form with  < 5% in the band B ER form, an expected result given that wild-type CFTR accumulates in post-Golgi compartments.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In contrast, in F508-CFTR to expressing HEK293 cells, the only form is band B reflecting its ER localization, its level of expression reflecting continuous degradation by ERAD (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Despite the large difference in the steady-state level of CFTR in wild-type and F508-expressing cells, when we quantitated the recovery of Sec24 with respect to the total amount of wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in band B using immunoblotting, we observed that F508-CFTR bound  < 25% of that observed for wild-type CFTR (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Sec24 was not recovered from HEK293 cells that do not express CFTR (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Because immunoprecipitations were performed on ice, it is likely that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of F508-CFTR resulted in partial folding after transfer to ice, accounting for the observed level of recovery of Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Although the band B ER form would be expected to be the only form of CFTR that would bind the ER-specific COPII coat machinery, we examined whether or not immunoprecipitation of Sec24 would recover band C, the cell surface form.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These results support the conclusion that the marked inefficiency of DAA-CFTR to exit the ER is a consequence of its inability to couple to the cargo selection complex Sec23/Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	194	To correlate the effects of the di-acidic code DAA-CFTR mutant on COPII binding with the effects of Phe508 on the ability of the F508-CFTR to exit the ER after transfer to 30 degrees C, we performed a temperature-shift experiment.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	195	 5 D, with increasing incubation time at 30 degrees C, F508 showed a strong increase in its interaction with Sec24, approaching the value observed for wild-type CFTR at 37 degrees C at steady-state.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	196	 These results suggest that reduced temperature promotes maturation of CFTR and presentation of the exit code for interaction with the COPII coat machinery for export from the ER.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	197	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   COPII-dependent export of CFTR Using Sar1 mutants with well-characterized biochemical properties, we found that export of wild-type CFTR is dependent on COPII coat assembly in mammalian cells.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This would be the expected result if wild-type CFTR, but not F508-CFTR, acquires the normal protein fold necessary for cargo selection by COPII.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Several lines of evidence support this conclusion.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	200	 First, the Sar1-GTP mutant that stabilizes coat assembly markedly reduces the rate of ERAD through capture into COPII transport intermediates that accumulate in the presence of activated Sar1 (Aridor et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Second, the Sar1-GDP mutant (that prevents COPII coat recruitment) inhibited export of wild-type CFTR, but did not stabilize the ER band B form.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It is unlikely that the effects of the GDP mutant on CFTR export were influenced by build-up of other cargo in the ER during the transient expression protocol as we observed inhibition of transport at the earliest time points of transfection when the inhibitory properties of the Sar1-GDP mutant begin to take effect.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This conclusion is supported by the ability of H89 to rapidly and efficiently uncouple CFTR from export in cells stably expressing wild-type CFTR.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Furthermore, in the two-stage assay using the Sar1ts mutant, we found that accumulation of CFTR in the ER at 32 degrees C had no effect on export after inactivation of Sar1ts at 40 degrees C.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Because we did not detect significant effects of Sar1-GDP (which uncouples CFTR from COPII) on degradation of CFTR, we suggest that the export and ERAD pathways operate independently.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	206	COPII does not participate in ERAD A recent paper (Fu and Sztul, 2003) suggested that targeting of CFTR to the ERAD pathway in S.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	207	 cerevisiae requires COPII because in the absence of COPII function CFTR accumulates in an ER-like subcompartment rather than being degraded (Kiser et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	208	, 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In contrast, we found that COPII does not participate in ERAD of either wild-type CFTR or F508-CFTR in mammalian cells.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The reasons for this discrepancy are now apparent.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	211	 First, CFTR will not exit the ER in yeast under any condition, limiting interpretation of the results (Kiser et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	212	, 2001; Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Second, all experiments used overexpression of a GFP-tagged variant of CFTR (GFP-CFTR).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	214	 A similar GFP-CFTR construct, when expressed in mammalian cells, has a markedly reduced rate of export and accumulates in ER tubular elements at 30 degrees C (comparable to experiments in yeast where cells are incubated at 24 degrees C) that significantly overlaps with calnexin (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This overlap is consistent with the fact that folding of nascent CFTR in the ER is likely to involve calnexin (Pind et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	216	 However, upon transfer to 37 degrees C, GFP-CFTR is efficiently exported to the cell surface of mammalian cells (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus, in mammalian cells, GFP-CFTR can accumulate transiently in a bona fide ER-like tubular network at reduced temperature that is unlikely to be a specialized COPII-regulated degradative subcompartment as suggested for yeast where export is blocked at all temperatures (Fu and Sztul, 2003; Sullivan et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	218	A third concern is that all experiments relied on temperature-sensitive COPII mutants to prevent degradation, leading to the interpretation that COPII is required for ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	219	 These experiments required prolonged incubation of yeast at the restrictive temperature (40 degrees C) to assess the effect of the mutant COPII component on ERAD.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	220	 It is well-established that elevated temperature (40 degrees ) in mammalian cells markedly stabilizes (approximately twofold) both wild-type CFTR and F508-CFTR from ERAD in response to induction of heat shock folding chaperones (Strickland et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	221	, 1999; Choo-Kang and Zeitlin, 2001; Farinha et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Thus, the twofold effect of the temperature-sensitive Sec12 variant on preventing CFTR degradation in yeast can be largely explained by the twofold difference in stability observed upon shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature in control incubations in the absence of the Sec12ts (Fu and Sztul, 2003).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	223	Fourth, unlike the Sar1-GDP and -GTP mutants, the biochemical properties of the Sec13 and Sec23 temperature-sensitive mutants have not been characterized.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	224	 For example, both Sec13 and Sec23 temperature-sensitive variants may not be inactivated by shifting to the restrictive temperature as suggested (Fu and Sztul, 2003).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Rather they may promote stable coat assembly leading to partial segregation of CFTR from ERAD as we have observed during COPII coat polymer assembly promoted by the Sar1-GTP mutant.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We conclude that role of COPII is to direct CFTR selection into COPII vesicles, removing the protein from the ERAD COPII-independent targeted pool.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	227	A di-acidic code mediates CFTR export An important finding that provides new insight into the role of COPII in export of CFTR from the ER was that processing of band B to C was sensitive to mutation of the conserved di-acidic code exit motif originally detected in the cytoplasmic tail of VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Consistent with this finding, a natural variant in the cystic fibrosis mutation database (http://www.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	229	ca/cftr/) has a substitution of G for D at position 565 (565DAD to 565GAD) that results in a severe deficiency phenotype, although this allele is complex (Tzetis et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The requirement for a di-acidic code in CFTR export is consistent with a similar requirement for a di-acidic motif for export of the multi-membrane-spanning K+ channel (Ma et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	231	, 2001; Ma and Jan, 2002) and yeast GAP permease (Malkus et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Given that transfer of the di-acidic code to an ER-retained protein is sufficient to promote efficient export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Nishimura et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	233	, 1999) and the fact that the di-acidic code recognizes the Sec24 subunit of the Sec23/24 complex (Miller et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	234	, 2002), it is now evident that the di-acidic motif may be used by CFTR to engage the Sec24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Our CFTR coimmunoprecipitation results provide direct evidence that the DAD motif in NBD1 of CFTR serves as a functional ER exit code as loss of the code results in impaired binding to Sec23/24.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In the case of the GAP permease, it has been suggested that the di-acidic code, although necessary for export, is not sufficient ((Miller et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	237	 A similar constraint may apply to CFTR as the protein has a complicated cytosolic folding pathway involving numerous chaperones and cochaperones (Pind et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	238	, 1998; Brodsky, 2001; Zhang et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	239	, 2002) that may facilitate recognition of the Sec23/Sec24 complex (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	240	NBD1 domains of a large variety of ABC transporters have a similar structural organization (Schmitt and Tampe, 2002).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Structural alignment of the NBD1 domain of CFTR (Lewis et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	242	, 2004) with the NBD1 domain of the ABC transporter BtuCD reveals that the di-acidic code is found in a solvent-exposed loop connecting the NH2-terminal helical domain containing Phe508 with the more COOH-terminal sheet domain (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Given that the structure of Sar1 and the Sec23/24 complex containing a bound di-acidic peptide are available (Huang et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	244	, 2003), we built a homology model with the NBD1 of CFTR replacing the similar structural fold of NBD1 of BtuCD (Fig.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This new structure (BtuCD-NBD1CFTR) was then combined with the structure of the Sec23/24 -Sar1 complex to illustrate the ability of the di-acidic code loop in NBD1CFTR to insert directly into the Sec23/24 di-acidic code binding pocket (Fig.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	251	, 2002), is oriented correctly to facilitate recruitment of Sec23/24 by activated Sar1.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	252	 It is apparent that Sar1 and BtuCD-NBD1CFTR interact with Sec23/Sec24 independently as shown for the holo cargo-selection complex.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Thus, the general structural features of the CFTR-NBD1 domain presented within the structure of BtuCD are consistent with the role of the di-acidic code in directing interaction with COPII for exit from the ER.

0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Consistent with this interpretation, F508-CFTR-Sec24 interaction and transport to cell surface can be rescued by promoting folding at 30 degrees C.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Moreover, export of F508-CFTR from the ER can also be rescued in cis by additional point mutations in NBD1 that stabilize the structural fold (DeCarvalho et al.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Given that over 1,000 mutants have been reported to affect CFTR export and function leading to varying degrees of disease, it is not surprising that residues flanking the di-acidic code have also been reported in the mutation database.
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Structural considerations strongly suggest that many of these flanking mutations, unlike the di-acidic code that is found in the solvent-exposed loop, are likely to affect the fold of the -helical and ss-strands that contribute to the structural organization of NBD1 and indirectly compromise presentation of the code (unpublished data).
0.41072902.15479737.html.plaintext.txt	275	 We propose that the inability of the F508-CFTR mutant to engage the COPII machinery through Sec24 is the primary basis for the most common form of CF.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	4	Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is known to involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In addition, an ATP-independent proteolytic system has been suggested to operate in parallel with this pathway and become up-regulated when proteasomes are inhibited (Jensen, T.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this study, we use two independent techniques, pulse-chase labeling and a noninvasive fluorescence cell-based assay, to investigate the proteolytic pathways underlying the degradation of misfolded CFTR.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we report that only inhibitors of the proteasome have a significant effect on preventing the degradation of CFTR, whereas cell-permeable inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, autophagy, and several classes of protease had no measurable effect on CFTR degradation, when used either alone or in combination with the specific proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-leucyl-L-leucinal (MG132).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Our results suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation is the dominant pathway for disposal of misfolded CFTR in mammalian cells and provide new mechanistic insight into endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	9	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	10	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the site of synthesis of membrane and secretory proteins and the site of their conformational maturation and assembly into correctly folded functional molecules.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	11	 "Quality control" refers to the system that monitors the folding and assembly of proteins in the ER, ensuring that only correctly folded proteins can mature to later compartments of the secretory pathway (1, 2).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Nascent proteins that fail to fold or assemble in the ER are degraded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Studies in mammalian cells and in yeast have led to the formulation of a general model for ERAD in which substrates are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes following retrotranslocation (i.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	14	 "dislocation") across the ER membrane by a process that requires the Sec61 translocon and functional ubiquitylation machinery at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (4-6).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Dislocation of ERAD substrates across the ER membrane is kinetically coupled to their degradation by proteasomes, and in many cases, cytosolic intermediates of degradation are hard to detect (7, 8).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although a central role for proteasomes in ERAD is widely accepted, a number of studies have suggested that other, nonproteasomal, proteolytic systems may also contribute to the elimination of misfolded proteins from the ER (9-12).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	17	The polytopic membrane protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel expressed at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells and one of the first integral membrane proteins demonstrated to be a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (9, 13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Mutations in the CFTR gene cause the recessively inherited fatal disease cystic fibrosis.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Although nearly 1000 mutations have been linked to cystic fibrosis, the majority of Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the F508 mutation, a temperature-sensitive allele that is unable to fold correctly at physiological temperature.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	20	 As a consequence, F508 CFTR (F508) is not deployed to the plasma membrane and is instead rapidly degraded without being processed in the Golgi apparatus (14, 15).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	21	Several lines of evidence support a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in F508 turnover.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	22	 First, CFTR undergoes both co-translational and posttranslational ubiquitylation when expressed in a cell-free system (16, 17).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Second, inhibition of proteasome function with chemical inhibitors or with a dominant negative form of ubiquitin leads to accumulation of multiubiquitylated, undegraded forms of CFTR and F508 (13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Third, degradation of F508 in a cell-free system is sensitive to inhibitors of both the 19 S and 20 S subunits of the proteasome (17, 18).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Curiously, despite this compelling evidence in support of a role for proteasomes in the degradation of misfolded CFTR, the effect of proteasome inhibition on the disappearance of F508 from pulse-chase studies is minimal (9, 13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This observation has led some investigators to conclude that other proteolytic systems are primarily responsible for the ERAD of misfolded CFTR molecules (9).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, no other proteases or proteolytic systems have been convincingly demonstrated to contribute to the degradation of CFTR or other ERAD substrates.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Therefore, the intracellular fate of F508 and the identity of the proteases that participate in its degradation remain unresolved.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	29	In this study, we used a reporter (GFP-F508) consisting of a fusion of GFP with F508 (19) to assess the participation of proteasomes and other proteolytic systems in F508 degradation.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Our data establish that proteolytic activities of the proteasome are responsible for vast majority of intracellular degradation of misfolded CFTR molecules.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Under these conditions, aggregation of GFP-F508 was undetectable by either immunoblot or fluorescence microscopy (data not shown).

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	71	 During the chase, the Mr 170,000 band disappeared with first-order kinetics (t1/2 = 50 min), consistent with previous determinations of F508 (9, 24, 25) and GFP-F508 half-life (23).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In the presence of MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor (26), the half-life of this species was only modestly extended (t1/2 = 1.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	87	The HMW complexes could represent either polyubiquitylated forms of monomeric GFP-F508 (16, 17) or detergent-insoluble aggregates of CFTR (23).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	88	 To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to determine whether the HMW material that accumulated during the chase in the presence of MG132 could be degraded after washout of the inhibitor.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Our results (data not shown) indicate that the HMW material was soluble in nonionic detergent and competent for degradation, strongly suggesting that the increase in molecular weight was due to covalent modification with Ub, as observed previously for CFTR in cell-free extracts (17).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	90	Quantification of the pulse-chase data indicates that MG132 was only marginally effective at stabilizing the Mr 170,000 F508 band.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	93	 This observation suggests several plausible explanations.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	94	 First, as suggested by Jensen et al.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	95	 (9), in addition to proteasomes, other proteolytic systems could also contribute to F508 ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Alternatively, it is possible that some proteolytic activities within the proteasome remain uninhibited in the presence of MG132 and continue to degrade the substrate.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Finally, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled material from detergent extracts of pulse-labeled cells may underestimate the amount of stable F508 if some of the protein becomes insoluble, if the epitope used for immunoprecipitation becomes inaccessible, or if the increased molecular weight (due to polyubiquitylation and/or aggregation) of the protein prevents it from being well resolved by SDS-PAGE.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	98	 We reasoned that a noninvasive method of monitoring the fluorescence of GFP-F508 in intact cells using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis may be a more accurate way to measure protein stability because it does not rely upon efficient recovery of radiolabeled protein from cells or upon the detection of a resolvable electrophoretic species.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This would in turn allow us to better evaluate the effect of protease inhibitors on prevention of CFTR degradation.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence fitted a first-order exponential with a t1/2 = 60 min, in good agreement with the GFP-F508 half-life measured in pulse-chase experiments (Fig.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In contrast, inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases (TPCK, N-tosyl-Lys-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), calpains (EDTA), lysosomal cathepsins ((2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, chloroquine, and NH4Cl), and autophagy (3-methyladenine and wortmannin) had no measurable effect on the degradation process, either alone (Fig.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This increase probably reflects slow fluorogenesis of the GFP moiety (t1/2 = 30-90 min; 27, 28) in the absence of CFTR degradation.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Indeed, this transient increase in fluorescence is also observed with GFPu, a GFP molecule that is targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system for degradation via a short carboxyl-terminal degron (20) (Fig.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	145	 To investigate whether the low-affinity component of the MG132 and epoxomicin titrations was due to non-CT-L activities, we performed a titration of epoxomicin in the presence of 500  microM YU102, an ','-epoxyketone inhibitor that is selective for the peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activity of the proteasome (30).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This treatment resulted in a small (10-15%) but significant increase in the degree of inhibition of GFP-F508 fluorescence decay at all epoxomicin concentrations (Fig.

0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	159	ER-associated degradation is a central element of the quality control pathways that ensure that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are deployed in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Although many studies have confirmed a primary role of the Ub-proteasome system in ERAD, the apparently minimal effect of highly potent proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of CFTR has remained an enigma and has suggested that other ATP-independent proteolytic systems also contribute to ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In this study, we have used a fluorescent substrate to re-evaluate the role of the UPS in ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Our data establish the primacy of the UPS in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded CFTR and suggest that the different proteolytic functionalities of the proteasome, associated with the three active -subunits, may operate independently in the degradation of an ERAD substrate (GFP-F508), but apparently not in the degradation of a cytoplasmic substrate (GFPu).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that the UPS is the principal pathway for degradation of misfolded CFTR.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	164	 First, proteasome inhibitors, but not inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal or autophagic pathways, strongly stabilize GFP-F508 fluorescence.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Second, GFP-F508 degradation was inhibited by MG132 and epoxomicin in a dose-dependent fashion, with biphasic apparent IC50 values in the expected range for CT-L and non-CT-L activities (30).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Third, GFP-F508 degradation was strictly dependent on ATP, a hallmark of UPS-mediated proteolysis (31, 32).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The possibility that other proteases initiate the clipping of the CFTR molecule while it is situated in the ER membrane, followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis, is also unlikely because simultaneous addition of protease and proteasome inhibitors did not protect CFTR from degradation.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Although our results do not rule out participation in CFTR degradation of protease classes for which cell-permeable inhibitors are not available (i.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	169	 aspartic proteases, aminopeptidases, and so forth) or of substrate-specific proteases (e.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	170	 colligin is a specific inhibitor of procollagen degradation (33)), these data establish that inhibition of proteolytic activities of the proteasome alone is sufficient to prevent the degradation of the majority of F508 molecules in living cells.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	171	In previous studies using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation, proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and lactacystin had a very modest effect at inhibiting the decay of the electrophoretic species corresponding to core-glycosylated F508 degradation (9, 13).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In the present work, we show that at least part of radiolabel lost from core-glycosylated GFP-F508 could be recovered as high molecular weight material.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Because this HMW material remains competent for degradation, our data suggest that in the absence of proteasome function, a significant fraction of radiolabeled GFP-F508 molecules are converted to multiubiquitylated forms.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Accumulation of HMW forms in the presence of proteasome inhibition is not observed for most other ERAD substrates such as the -subunit of the T-cell receptor (7, 34) and soluble proteins such as IgG light chains (8), which tend to accumulate as core-glycosylated detergent-soluble monomers in the ER after proteasome inhibition.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	175	 It is likely that this difference is a consequence of the topology of CFTR, in which most of the mass of the protein is accessible to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and hence to components of the ubiquitin conjugation system.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	176	 A recent study reported that inhibition of proteasome function leads to accumulation of a substantial fraction of CFTR in reconstituted cell-free extracts as high molecular weight multiubiquitylated protein (17).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	177	In our studies, no proteasome inhibitor or combination thereof was able to completely suppress the decay of GFP-F508 fluorescence.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	178	 It is unlikely that this apparent degradation (a ~20-30% decrease of fluorescence after a 4-h chase in the presence of proteasome inhibitors) is the result of cell death due to toxic effects of simultaneous exposure to emetine and proteasome inhibitor because  > 98% of cells were able to exclude propidium iodide staining at the end of a 4-h chase.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Alternatively, the decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence could, in principle, be due to self-quenching of GFP fluorescence in closely packed aggregates of GFP-F508, which are known to form upon chronic exposure to proteasome inhibitors (23).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Such self-quenching is a form of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fluorescence resonance energy transfer homotransfer).
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Because we do not observe heterotransfer between the compatible fluorescence resonance energy transfer heterotransfer pair CFP-F508 and YFP-F508, even under conditions designed to maximize aggregation,2 it is unlikely that homotransfer between adjacent GFP-F508 molecules could account for the observed decrease in fluorescence.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	182	 It is also formally possible that the small decrease in GFP-F508 fluorescence could be due to partial unfolding of the GFP moiety by the ATPase activity of the 19 S proteasome cap, without actual degradation of CFTR itself.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, the simplest explanation may be that none of the proteasome inhibitors used, alone or in combination, are able to fully inhibit all of the three proteasomal -subunits.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This explanation is consistent with conversion of a similar fraction (~30%) of labeled GFP-F508 as high molecular weight multiubiquitin conjugates in the presence of MG132 in both our pulse-labeling experiments (Fig.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	185	 1) and in the cell-free experiments of Oberdorf et al.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It is likely, therefore, that the proteolytic activities of the proteasome associated with individual -subunits do not act in a strictly cooperative fashion in ERAD.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Our findings with GFP-F508 in vivo are consistent with those of Oberdorf et al.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	188	 (18), who found that complete inhibition of the 5-subunit (associated with CT-L activity) led to only a 40% reduction in cell-free CFTR degradation, and with those of Myung et al.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	189	 (30), who reported recently that selective peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing inhibition is insufficient to inhibit protein degradation in vivo.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	190	 These data all strongly indicate that the catalytic sites of the proteasome function independently.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	191	 It is not clear why, in our studies, the degradation of GFPu, a small soluble substrate of the UPS, is completely inhibited by MG132, whereas degradation of GFP-F508 is not.
0.42448953.11812794.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Perhaps this discrepancy is a reflection of functional differences in the mechanisms by which proteasomes engage substrates delivered from the cytosol and those that are dislocated across the ER membrane.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	4	 SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   The focus of this review is the regulated trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway and the question of how changes in CFTR cellular distribution may impact on the functions of polarized epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We summarize data concerning the cellular localization and activity of CFTR and attempt to synthesize often conflicting results from functional studies of regulated endocytosis and exocytosis in CFTR-expressing cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In some instances, findings that are inconsistent with regulated CFTR trafficking may result from the use of overexpression systems or nonphysiological experimental conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Nevertheless, judging from data on other transporters, an appropriate cellular context is necessary to support regulated CFTR trafficking, even in epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The discovery that disease mutations can influence CFTR trafficking in distal secretory and recycling compartments provides support for the concept that regulated CFTR recycling contributes to normal epithelial function, including the control of apical CFTR channel density and epithelial protein secretion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, we propose molecular mechanisms for regulated CFTR endocytosis and exocytosis that are based on CFTR interactions with other proteins, particularly those whose primary function is membrane trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These models provide testable hypotheses that may lead to elucidation of CFTR trafficking mechanisms and permit their experimental manipulation in polarized epithelial cells.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	12	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is responsible for the cAMP-activated anion conductance of epithelial cell apical membranes.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	13	 As a principal apical conductance pathway, the CFTR anion channel is involved in cAMP-dependent Cl and bicarbonate secretion in airway and intestinal epithelia and exocrine glands.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	14	 It also influences the activity of other conductive pathways, through either linked regulatory interactions or electrochemical coupling that influences the driving forces for ion transport (49, 93).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Subsequent to the cloning of the CFTR gene, methods for in situ hybridization and the development of antibodies to CFTR permitted the characterization of its distribution in a variety of tissues (52, 104, 107).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The results generally correlated with the presence of cAMP/PKA-stimulated anion secretory processes in various epithelial tissues, identified in earlier studies using physiological methods.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Mutations in the gene encoding CFTR produce cystic fibrosis (CF), whereas hyperactivity of this transport pathway underlies secretory diarrheas.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	18	 CF disease arises from a reduced density and/or activity of CFTR in the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, such as those in the airways, exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, reproductive tissues, and intestines.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A regulated CFTR conductance pathway is also important for the normal functions of several absorptive cells, including epithelia lining the airway surface and sweat gland ducts (for a general review, see Ref.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	20	The subject of this review is CFTR trafficking in the distal portion of the protein secretory pathway, which lies between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Historically, studies of this pathway were motivated by the question of whether it would be possible to explain all of the manifestations of CF disease on the basis of a missing anion conductance at the apical membranes of epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Accordingly, functional roles for CFTR other than its primary role as an apical membrane anion conductance pathway have been proposed to contribute to CF pathology.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These include disease-associated changes in regulated protein secretion (65), the chemistry of macromolecular secretions (22, 33, 90), and the properties of the airway microenvironment that lead to bacterial colonization of CF airways (89).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	24	Although the attention of numerous investigators has focused on CFTR trafficking through the distal protein secretory pathway as a possible contributor to the complexity of CF disease, a consensus regarding the importance of intracellular CFTR function and the process of regulated CFTR trafficking within this subcellular domain has yet to emerge.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	25	 As an integral membrane protein, CFTR will reside at least transiently in all compartments of the protein secretory pathway as it migrates toward the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Thus one can expect to find CFTR in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and endosomal and lysosomal compartments of epithelial cells (Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although there is no question that CFTR channels function as a regulated conductance pathway when they are resident in the apical membrane, numerous studies (see CFTR LOCALIZATION IN CELLS) have also indicated that a significant quantity of mature (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	28	, post-Golgi) CFTR is contained within intracellular compartments, that CFTR within these compartments is functional (9, 78), and that cAMP stimulation can modulate the distribution of CFTR between these compartments and the plasma membrane (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Therefore, the issue is not whether apical Cl conductance is due to regulation of the gating of membrane-resident CFTR channels or whether it results from the insertion of CFTR channels into the membrane, because both processes occur.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Mature CFTR leaves the Golgi in vesicles that can travel directly to the apical plasma membrane or to the recycling endosome.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	35	 CFTR-containing vesicles continually traffic between recycling endosomes and plasma membrane, with rates of trafficking and protein distribution determined by cell type, differentiation, and phosphorylation conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	36	 CFTR eventually follows the late endosome-to-lysosome pathway for degradation.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	38	This area of CFTR cell biology has been among the most contentious and unresolved subjects in CF research, and it continues to be so.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In a relatively recent review of this subject, Bradbury (10) argued that disparate conclusions regarding the regulation of the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments might be reconciled if regulated CFTR trafficking was a property specific to epithelial cells, i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	40	, studies showing a lack of CFTR trafficking were generally performed in fibroblasts.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Nevertheless, four years after the Bradbury review, the literature has not been clarified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Accordingly, the task of bringing some synthesis to this conflicting data set is not an easy one.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Yet, we feel that it is possible to do so and that the attempt should add to our understanding of the control of plasma membrane CFTR density, a critical issue in CF disease.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	46	 SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   This review is primarily concerned with the steadystate distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments and with the effect of cAMP/PKA-mediated stimulation on its distribution.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The methods used to determine cellular CFTR localization have relied primarily on its detection by antibodies in cultured cells or tissue sections.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Other studies have employed functional assays subsequent to cell fractionation, and others have relied on the expression of epitope-tagged or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CFTR fusion proteins as a method of locating exogenously expressed CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Cellular targets for these studies have included both polarized and non-polar cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Detection of a reliable CFTR signal has often required overexpression of this normally low-abundance protein in heterologous systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	51	Location of mature CFTR (band C).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	52	 From a biochemical standpoint, the prevailing view is that core-glycosylated, immature (band B) CFTR is localized in the ER, whereas complex glycosylated, mature (band C) CFTR is present primarily in compartments distal to the Golgi, including the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In contrast with many heterologous expression systems, relatively little band B is observed by immunoblot in most epithelial cells expressing CFTR endogenously at steady state.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For example, the ratio of band C to B in Calu-3 airway cells is 10 (100).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This indicates that most of the CFTR expressed endogenously in epithelial cells is located in distal compartments of the protein secretory pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The first reported studies of CFTR localization, performed in COS-7 cells transiently expressing CFTR, showed a weak, diffuse plasma membrane staining pattern.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Most of the signal was intracellular, probably due to protein overexpression (23).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In polarized epithelial cells that express CFTR endogenously (T84, HT29, Caco-2, and airway epithelia), this signal was located unambiguously at the apical membrane domain (27, 28).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	59	 No staining was detected in the basolateral membrane, and little perinuclear staining of CFTR was observed in epithelial monolayers, implying that little CFTR is present in the ER at steady state (consistent with the low levels of band B).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	60	 (27) highlighted the importance of localizing CFTR within epithelial cells that express the protein endogenously.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In the same study, a mostly intracellular location of exogenously expressed CFTR was found in non-polar HeLa and 3T3 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The central question concerning the issue of regulated CFTR trafficking is whether the protein that contributes to the plasma membrane anion conductance is present strictly in the apical plasma membranes of epithelial cells or whether it is present also in a subapical, post-Golgi compartment from which it is mobilized to the cell surface during stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	63	 A related issue is whether CFTR is stable in the plasma membrane or undergoes recycling to intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In this regard, a rapid rate of CFTR endocytosis from the cell surface has been observed in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 61, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These studies used biotinylation procedures to monitor the rate of CFTR internalization from the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In T84 cells, it was estimated that 50% of cell surface CFTR is retrieved within a few minutes (85); in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells the internalization rate was 5% per minute (61).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These rates of endocytosis are not different from those of constitutively recycling receptors, such as those for transferrin or LDL.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These findings, together with the estimated 24- to 48-h half-life of mature, plasma membrane CFTR (7, 41), indicate that virtually all of the CFTR that is internalized by endocytosis must be returned to the plasma membrane by a recycling/exocytic pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The presence of this rapid CFTR recycling pathway is a minimal requirement for a regulated insertion-retrieval model that controls cellular CFTR distribution.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Thus the question should not be whether CFTR undergoes trafficking at the plasma membrane but whether this process contributes to a change in the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in response to cAMP/PKA regulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	71	In addition to these kinetic considerations, the presence of CFTR in endosomes under steady-state conditions has been established with the use of a combination of biochemical techniques and functional assays that rely on CFTR's anion channel activity.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	72	 (12) resolved CFTR in the early stages of endosomal retrieval within clathrin-coated vesicles from epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	73	 CFTR was demonstrated to be present in this compartment by immunoblot.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	74	 After removal of the clathrin lattice by uncoatase and fusion of the resulting membranes with planar lipid bilayers, currents with biophysical and regulatory properties characteristic of CFTR were observed.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Because clathrin removal was a necessary prerequisite for reconstitution, CFTR was definitely a component of this endocytic compartment.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Additional studies have demonstrated that the rapid endocytosis of CFTR from the cell surface depends on clathrin-mediated pathways and that CFTR is not significantly internalized into caveolae (11, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Several transport and/or channel proteins have been found to internalize via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, including aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) (101), Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3) (24), renal outer medulla K channels (ROMK) (114), and epithelial Na channels (ENaC) (96).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Recent studies of the mechanism of CFTR endocytosis (see Functional studies of endocytosis) indicate a direct physical interaction of CFTR with the plasma membrane adapter complex, making CFTR a specific target of this endocytic machinery.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	79	Other methods for demonstrating the presence of CFTR in endosomes have relied on the ability of CFTR to provide a pathway for anion transport that parallels the vacuolar H-ATPase.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	80	 (60) allowed CHO cells expressing CFTR to take up the pH-sensitive dye FITC-dextran into endosomes, where the rate of dissipation of a pH gradient across endosomal membranes was stimulated by addition of a proton ionophore.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In these intact cells, pH gradient dissipation was limited by the counterion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Activation of cAMP production elicited a twofold increase in the rate of pH change in cells expressing CFTR but not in parental or mock-transfected cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The results were duplicated in microsomes isolated from these cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Biwersi and Verkman (9) used a similar method for monitoring endosomal pH in CFTR-transfected 3T3 cells and in T84 cells endogenously expressing CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Treatment of the cells with forskolin before microsome isolation produced an approximately twofold increase in the rate of subsequently measured pH gradient dissipation but had no effect on microsomes isolated from nontransfected or F508 CFTR-expressing 3T3 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	86	 These data are also consistent with the presence of functional CFTR in endosomes that, in principle, could contribute to CFTR recycling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy for detection of cellular CFTR, investigators have generated data that arrive at somewhat divergent conclusions with respect to the importance of regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	88	 On one side of this issue is the study of Lehrich et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	89	 (55) in shark rectal gland, a tissue that expresses CFTR at high levels endogenously.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	90	 These investigators used quantitative confocal microscopy to show that CFTR immunofluorescence extended from the apical membrane into subapical, supernuclear regions of the cell and that during stimulation with secretagogues, the overall depth of this CFTR signal decreased by 50%.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Similar conclusions were reached when the histogram of CFTR fluorescence intensity as a function of distance from the apical membrane was quantitated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	92	 These cAMP agonist effects on CFTR distribution, imposed in perfused, intact rectal glands before fixation, were reversible.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Whether this shift in fluorescence signal represents insertion of vesicles containing CFTR into the apical membrane remains unknown; however, the findings are consistent with the acute hormonal regulation of CFTR trafficking in an intact epithelial tissue.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	94	 (1, 2) used immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify the cellular location of CFTR in rat small intestine and the influence of cAMP-dependent agonists on its distribution.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) elicited a bicarbonate-rich fluid secretory response in isolated perfused intestinal loops and elicited, within the same time frame, a redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	96	 CFTR association with the apical membrane was quantified by colocalization of F-actin as a brush border marker.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	97	 In duodenal villus cells, VIP elicited a reversible, threefold increase in brush border associated CFTR, and it redistributed CFTR within the cell apex to the brush border within 30 min.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	98	 These studies were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopic methods (see Immunoelectron microscopy).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The results provide support for a physiological role for cAMP-induced CFTR-containing membrane traffic in the regulation of the apical anion conductance in a native, endogenously expressing epithelium.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	100	Other investigators have reached different conclusions with respect to regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	101	 (70) expressed a GFP-CFTR fusion protein in MDCK type I epithelial cells and used quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation to determine the effect of cAMP stimulation on apical membrane CFTR localization.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Their findings showed that cAMP did not stimulate detectable GFP-CFTR translocation from intracellular compartments to the apical membrane, along an apical-to-basal GFP fluorescence gradient that extended throughout the cell.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In these cells, cAMP did not regulate GFP-CFTR endocytosis, determined by apical biotinylation and subsequent immunoprecipitation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Likewise, disruption of microtubules with colchicine did not affect cAMP-stimulation of Cl secretion or the expression of GFP-CFTR in the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Thus the authors concluded that cAMP stimulates CFTR-mediated Cl secretion in MDCK type I cells by activating only the channels that are resident in the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	106	 A regulated CFTR trafficking event may be lacking in this cell type; however, it is also reasonable to ask whether the exogenous expression of CFTR driven by the CMV promoter leads to saturation of regulated trafficking pathways (see Functional studies of exocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	107	A related study (58) involving measurements of cellular CFTR immunolocalization in endogenously expressing Calu-3 epithelia by fluorescence confocal microscopy detected no change in apical CFTR staining upon cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Surface biotinylation experiments reported in the same study (58) also showed no stimulation-dependent increase in apical membrane CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Two biotinylated proteins were detected by CFTR antibody precipitation following biotinylation; they were of equal intensity and 200 to 220 kDa in molecular size.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Yet, others have demonstrated by immunoblot that CFTR in Calu-3 cells shows the typical pattern of a predominant band C of 150 to 180 kDa and relatively little band B; the latter is presumably intracellular (c.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Thus it is not clear that the biotin-labeled proteins identified in these experiments were CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	112	It is possible that differences in the conclusions drawn from fluorescence measurements in native and cultured epithelial cells stem from variations in the distribution of CFTR in subapical compartments under nonstimulated conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In the studies of native secretory tissues (shark rectal gland and rat intestine), the apical fluorescence signal extended into the cell sufficiently to detect a clear change in its distribution with stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In MDCK cells expressing GFP-CFTR (70), there was an even deeper distribution of expressed protein, but this may reflect its deposition in nonphysiological compartments, as described earlier in this article.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Given quantitative limitations of GFP visualization, 7 molecules/pixel (79), it may be necessary to express CFTR at nonphysiological levels to obtain a CFTR signal.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In Calu-3 cells (58), the CFTR signal was much more densely localized at the apical membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Nevertheless, it is reasonable to ask whether a band of apical fluorescence detected in epithelial cross sections can resolve apical membrane CFTR from that present in a nearby subapical recycling pool.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Consideration of the point-spread function of fluorescence intensity variation with distance suggests that structures separated by  > 0.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	119	2  microm will not be resolved using light microscopy.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Thus immunofluorescence, even coupled with confocal microscopy, may lack the ability to resolve fluorescence signals from membrane vesicles having a diameter of 0.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	121	1  microm or less, which are components of the CFTR recycling pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This vesicle size expectation is based on neurosecretory and other regulated trafficking vesicles (see APPENDIX).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	123	 For example, intracellular GLUT-4 staining by thin-section immunoelectron microscopy was localized to vesiculotubular structures 50 to 70 nm in diameter (62).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Thus it is possible that different conclusions at the light microscopic level may emerge from different cellular distributions of intracellular CFTR trafficking compartments and their constituents (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The results of several studies using immunoelectron microscopic methods are consistent with a subapical population of post-Golgi CFTR (c.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	126	 (86) used immunogold labeling to localize CFTR in vesicles present beneath the plasma membrane of human airway epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	127	 They also observed vesicles in the process of fusion or retrieval from the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Immunogold labeling of CFTR-expressing L cells and Sf9 cells also demonstrated the presence of CFTR beneath the plasma membrane as well as in the rough ER (26).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Studies of the striated duct of rat submandibular gland cells by Webster et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	130	 (107) showed immunogold labeling of CFTR along the apical membrane as well as in numerous subapical membrane vesicles.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Their estimates of labeling density suggested that more CFTR is present in subapical intracellular compartments than in the plasma membrane under "resting" conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Some of the CFTR-labeled vesicles also stained with antibodies against the transferrin receptor and rab4, two endosomal markers, indicating that these vesicles are likely part of an endosomal/recycling pathway for CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	133	The fluorescence measurements of Ameen et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	134	 (1), performed in rat small intestine, were confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	135	 CFTR was identified in subapical vesicles in several intestinal cell types, including cells from the crypt, Brunner glands, and a subpopulation of villar cells where CFTR expression predominated (so-called CFTR high expressors, or CHE cells).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	136	 cAMP stimulation elicited a two- to threefold increase in CFTR labeling of the apical microvilli of CHE cells in response to cholera toxin, providing evidence for regulated insertion of CFTR into the apical membranes of a native epithelium.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	137	 (42) examined apical membrane domain CFTR localization as a function of CFTR expression level.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In an earlier study (43), these investigators showed that CFTR located in the plasma membrane could be discriminated from intracellular CFTR by using nonpermeabilized MDCK cells expressing an extracellular epitope-tagged CFTR (where the flag, M2 epitope, was added to the 4th extracellular loop of CFTR, after amino acid 901).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	139	 They found that cAMP stimulation increased the cell surface signal of CFTR two-to threefold in the steady state.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In the more recent studies, they induced CFTR expression by using a recombinant adenovirus that encoded M2-901/CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Virally expressed, FLAG-tagged CFTR was functional and could be detected on the apical surface of forskolin-stimulated, polarized MDCK (type II) cells by immunofluorescence performed on nonpermeabilized epithelial monolayers.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	142	 At a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	143	, lower CFTR expression level), forskolin stimulated the insertion of M2-901/CFTR into the apical membrane, but at higher MOI and M2-901/CFTR expression levels, no agonist-dependent increase in surface expression could be detected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the redistribution of CFTR to the apical membrane upon forskolin stimulation at the lower CFTR expression levels and demonstrated that the apically inserted CFTR originated from a population of subapical vesicles.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Results similar to these have been obtained with the use of immunoelectron microscopy in Calu-3 cells endogenously expressing CFTR, where a two- to threefold increase in apical CFTR was observed in response to acute forskolin stimulation (Hug MJ and Frizzell RA, unpublished observation).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	146	The observations of Howard et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	147	 (42) may reconcile at least some of the prior conflicting reports regarding the effect of cAMP stimulation on CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	148	 They show that a high level of CFTR expression, obtained by using strong promoters, for example (70), can saturate pathways for regulated CFTR trafficking, even in epithelial systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Also in oocytes, the CFTR trafficking signal (cAMP-induced increase in membrane capacitance) saturated as the CFTR expression level was elevated by injection of more RNA (102).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Inappropriate trafficking of AQP-2, in relation to the actions of dominant-negative AQP-2 mutants, has also been observed at high protein expression levels (51).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Later in this article, we discuss candidate protein interactions that may mediate regulated CFTR trafficking at the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	152	 If cells express different levels of the relevant traffic regulatory proteins, then it is likely that the contribution of regulated CFTR trafficking to the total anion conductance (as opposed to regulated gating of membrane resident CFTR) will vary in different epithelial or nonepithelial systems.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Because the secretion of mucin in several CFTR-expressing tissues is stimulated by cAMP (65), and because cAMP/PKA regulatory pathways also control CFTR gating, it was reasonable to anticipate that protein secretion by exocytosis may lead also to an increase in the numbers of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane (Fig.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	168	 These workers found that apical membrane CFTR was rapidly internalized by T84 cells (half-time of 3 min), and they showed that cAMP decreased this internalization rate to an extent similar to that found in prior studies of fluid-phase endocytosis (60% inhibition).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	169	 They also showed that the internalization rate of G551D CFTR was similar to that of the wild-type protein but that, interestingly, its endocytosis was not affected by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This finding suggested that either the channel activity of CFTR is related to its ability to be retrieved from the cell surface or the altered structure of the G551D mutant precludes regulation of both gating and trafficking.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, the use of in vitro phosphorylation to detect CFTR after its biotinylation and immunoprecipitation may be influenced by the existing phosphorylation status of the protein, thus compromising surface CFTR detection.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	174	 That is, if CFTR is already phosphorylated by agonist, the subsequent CFTR signal would be reduced because phosphorylation sites are already occupied.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	175	 A method that avoids this complication employs a second CFTR antibody to detect biotinylated CFTR, which avoids the potential for back-phosphorylation to reduce the signal.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This approach also demonstrates a forskolin-induced inhibition of CFTR endocytosis, a depletion of the protein from intracellular compartments, and a consequent increase in plasma membrane CFTR (61).

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This was abolished by endosomal Cl depletion, suggesting that a CFTR-mediated Cl flux, or the conformational changes in CFTR associated with Cl conduction, somehow contribute to this process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	184	 These data are consistent with the concept that CFTR stimulation can alter membrane traffic in endosomal recycling pathways.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	185	Recent findings have been able to establish certain structural features of CFTR that govern its rapid removal from the cell surface.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The YDSI sequence of CFTR interacts specifically with the  micro2 subunit of AP-2 (108), a site implicated in adapter binding to similar endocytic motifs (74).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Protein binding studies showed that the COOH terminus binds selectively to this adapter subunit.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These studies indicate that the interaction of CFTR's COOH terminus with AP-2 guides it into the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, as observed for many cell surface receptors.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Although these studies provide compelling evidence for specific protein interactions that mediate CFTR retrieval at the cell surface, they do not yet provide an indication of how this process may be regulated by cAMP/PKA.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	207	 To monitor exocytosis, the plasma membranes were pulse-labeled with a biotinylated lectin (WGA), and after its removal from the bath, the cells were allowed to take up lectin into intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Remaining cell surface WGA was blocked with unlabeled avidin, and at various times the recycling of internalized WGA to the cell surface was assayed using Texas Red-labeled avidin.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In cells expressing wt CFTR, recycling and exocytosis of internalized marker was increased approximately threefold by forskolin, whereas cAMP stimulation had no effect on WGA recycling in either the parental CFPAC-1 cell line or in empty vector controls.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Importantly, these studies showed that cAMP-responsive recycling/exocytosis required CFTR expression.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	211	Similar findings were obtained in human airway cell lines (94) where recycling/exocytosis was monitored as the release of previously internalized FITC-dextran (a fluid-phase marker of endocytosis) from human airway cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Treatment of cells expressing wt CFTR with a cAMP analog elicited increased release of FITC-dextran, and this was accompanied by increases in membrane capacitance monitored during whole cell patch-clamp measurements.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Again, trafficking was CFTR dependent; cAMP had no effect on membrane capacitance or recycling/exocytosis in airway cells derived from a CF patient.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The investigators concluded that cAMP stimulates exocytosis and the CFTR Cl conductance of normal but not CF cells and that it does so by stimulating the delivery of CFTR channels from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	215	Much of the effort to determine whether cAMP stimulates CFTR-dependent membrane trafficking has employed measurements of membrane capacitance in cells that express CFTR endogenously or cells in which CFTR expression was induced.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These studies are summarized in Table 1, which tabulates the methods, conditions, and experimental results of these studies.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	217	 As discussed below, the diversity of methods and conditions used may contribute to their variable outcome.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Measurement of stimulated capacitance in CFTR-expressing tissue.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	220	, CHO cells) failed to show CFTR- and cAMP-dependent membrane trafficking (29, 47), again suggesting that the machinery for regulated CFTR recycling may be expressed only in epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, studies of Xenopus oocytes generally have shown a good correlation between cAMP stimulation of CFTR currents and increases in membrane capacitance (81, 102, 105).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In the studies of Takahashi et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	223	 (102), the apparent changes in cell surface area with stimulation, determined from membrane capacitance measurements, were confirmed by using blinded measurements of membrane morphometry in stimulated and nonstimulated cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In addition, recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface was demonstrated by using epitope-tagged M2-901/CFTR labeling of nonpermeabilized cells (81).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Together, these findings are consistent with the exocytic insertion of CFTR into the oocyte plasma membrane during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The cell surface immunofluorescence studies of Peters et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	227	 (81) suggested a low level of CFTR expression in the plasma membrane of nonstimulated oocytes (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	228	, fluorescence levels were near background in the absence of stimulation).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	229	 These data suggested that recruitment of CFTR to the cell surface is a significant component of CFTR current stimulation in this system.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, this conclusion assumes that the flag-CFTR labeling approach can detect low levels of cell surface CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Although technically difficult, it would be optimal to determine a dose-response relation between cAMP-dependent cell surface CFTR labeling and some independent parameter such as the corresponding change in membrane capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	232	 It is possible, for example, that some threshold level of CFTR residing in the plasma membrane cannot be detected by this method, underestimating levels of CFTR at the cell surface under basal conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	233	 However, this concern does not compromise the data, obtained from three different methods, consistent with stimulation-dependent recruitment of CFTR to the surface of these cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	234	The electrophysiological aspects of these studies were confirmed by the work of Weber et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	235	 (105), who used impedance analysis to assess membrane conductance and capacitance and correlated the changes in these parameters induced by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In agreement with prior reports (81, 102), cAMP stimulation of CFTR-expressing oocytes evoked significant increases in both current and capacitance that were not observed in noninjected or F508-expressing cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Injection of Rp-cAMP (a specific cAMP antagonist) abolished the effects of the cAMP stimulation on both current and capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Interestingly, the less specific PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H8, after prolonged (overnight) exposure, primarily blocked the capacitance increases evoked by cAMP while having less effect on the corresponding current activation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	239	 However, these reagents have been shown to alter cytoskeletal properties.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For example, KT5720 induces microtubule rearrangement by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (76), and H8 has been shown to alter cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation through inhibition of PKC (63).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	241	 It would be interesting to explore these actions further, because both of these less selective kinase inhibitors produce cytoskeletal disruption, which may account for their inhibitory effects on membrane trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	242	 (106) showed that microtubule disruption markedly inhibits current and capacitance increases evoked by cAMP in CFTR-expressing oocytes, and similar conclusions have been reached in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells (103).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	243	Although two groups have independently demonstrated cAMP-dependent changes in membrane capacitance and other parameters indicative of regulated CFTR trafficking in Xenopus oocytes, using different analytic methods Liu et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	244	 (57) arrived at a different conclusion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	245	 They employed a CFTR construct containing a cysteine substitution in the postulated CFTR conduction pathway to arrive at the conclusion that essentially all conductance activation by cAMP in oocytes was due to CFTR channels that are already present in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This approach relied on changes in conductance induced by treatment of this CFTR mutant with cysteine-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, whose effects have been attributed to altered charge shielding properties in the CFTR conduction pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	247	 When oocytes were treated briefly with 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET; a positively charged modifier) for as little as 20 s before cAMP activation, the activated channels behaved as if their properties were already modified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Because MTSET has been demonstrated in other systems to be cell impermeant, the data suggest that the modified channels must have already been present at the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	249	 These findings are consistent with a lack of regulated CFTR redistribution in oocytes, but they need not negate the results of prior studies for two reasons.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	250	 First, this study used CFTR expression levels (based on conductance) that are 5 to 10 times higher than the prior work in which capacitance measurements were made.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	251	 As discussed earlier in this article, overexpression of CFTR can saturate pathways available for regulated trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Consistent with this idea, Takahashi et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	253	 (102) observed that increasing CFTR expression levels increased CFTR currents, but the corresponding capacitance changes plateaued, as if regulated trafficking pathways had saturated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Constitutive delivery of CFTR to the plasma membrane at high expression levels would limit one's ability to detect a population of trafficking channels.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	255	 (57) did not measure membrane capacitance, cell surface CFTR, or any other measure of CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Nevertheless, there is not a facile explanation for differences between these carefully performed studies and those cited above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	257	 It should be determined, using MTS CFTR modification together with capacitance measurements or surface CFTR labeling, whether high CFTR expression levels would account for these results.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	258	Two recent studies, performed in mammalian epithelial cells that endogenously express CFTR, have reported negative findings with respect to changes in membrane capacitance during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	259	 As an independent assay, both studies also employed FM 1-43 dye labeling in an attempt to monitor membrane addition to the plasma membrane that would result from exocytosis stimulated by cAMP.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	260	 (21), membrane capacitance was measured in Calu-3 airway cells by imposing alternating sinusoidal and square voltage waveforms and monitoring the resulting currents to assess membrane capacitance and conductance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The calculated capacitance changes induced by cAMP were insignificant.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In addition, they found no increase in steady-state plasma membrane labeling by FM 1-43 when the cells were stimulated by cAMP during fluorescence measurements.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Enhanced dye labeling (fluorescence intensity) would be expected if additional membrane were exposed at the cell surface as a result of exocytosis.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Thus the authors concluded that cAMP does not stimulate CFTR currents by increasing CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane but stimulates only membrane-resident CFTR channels in Calu-3 cells.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	269	, no detectable cAMP-induced changes in membrane capacitance or FM dye labeling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	270	 In HT29 cells, increases in membrane capacitance with cAMP stimulation occurred only when endocytosis was blocked with the use of a dynamin antibody.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	271	 As the authors indicated, the absence of a change without dynamin inhibition may result from parallel increases in both exocytosis and endocytosis during stimulation, i.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	273	 (20), despite the sophisticated methodologies employed, have two significant shortcomings that preclude definitive conclusions regarding regulated CFTR trafficking in these systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	274	 First, both studies were performed at room temperature, a condition that is known to impair regulated membrane traffic in a variety of systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	275	 For example, the release of amylase from pancreatic exocrine cells is decreased 70% at 25 degrees C compared with normal temperature.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In addition, cAMP-regulated AQP-2 recycling in renal cells is blocked at 20 degrees C (38).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Indeed, recent data collected in this laboratory (45) indicate that studies performed at 37 degrees C in Calu-3 cells using either sinusoidal waveform analysis or current transient analysis show a 1 pF increase in membrane capacitance (basal membrane capacitance averages 20 pF) in response to cAMP stimulation that parallels the increase in membrane conductance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	279	 When identical recordings were made at room temperature with 5 or 10 mM EGTA in the pipette solution (conditions of the Chen and Chang studies), cAMP elicited no significant increase in membrane capacitance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	280	 It is interesting that early recordings of capacitance changes in airway cells (94) showed cAMP-dependent increases at 23 degrees C (Table 1); however, these experiments employed low EGTA concentrations (Ca buffering at normal resting levels) in the recording pipette.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Thus the recording conditions have not been consistent.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	282	The assays of FM dye labeling (also performed at room temperature) were conducted by using a protocol that is insensitive to small increases in membrane area.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The cells were labeled to steady-state intensity with FM dye, and their fluorescence intensity was monitored during cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, if the increase in plasma membrane area induced by cAMP is only 3% over the basal membrane area (suggested from capacitance measurements at 37 degrees C; Ref.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	285	 46), this signal would not be detected during steady-state dye labeling.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Rather, subsequent to stimulation, it is necessary to wash out dye and agonist from the membrane to minimize plasma membrane (background) staining.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This permits visualization of the dye retrieved by subsequent endocytosis of labeled plasma membrane, assuming that the cell recovers to its original area following reversal of stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	288	 As recent studies in this laboratory performed at 37 degrees C have demonstrated, measurements performed in this manner indicate that FM 1-43 labeling is increased by cAMP stimulation in Calu-3 (45).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The protocol used in the studies of Chen et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	290	 (20) is similar to methods employed to monitor secretory granule release in systems that incorporate large amounts of membrane into the cell surface during stimulation (e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	291	, pancreatic acinar cells), generally in response to stimulation by a cellular calcium rise (36).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In these systems, the addition of membrane (and increase in FM dye signal) at steady state is easily demonstrated, as it is in HT29 to 16E cells during stimulation of mucin secretion by Ca-dependent agonists (Bertrand CA, Laboisse C, Hopfer U, Bridges RJ, and Frizzell RA, unpublished observations).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Estimates of the numbers of CFTR channels in intracellular vesicles obtained by using data derived from Calu-3 cell and oocyte measurements are provided in the APPENDIX.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Important assumptions in these calculations include the single-channel parameters and assumed vesicle radius (100 nm).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	295	 The calculations are based on reported values of membrane current and capacitance changes from patch-clamp studies of cAMP-stimulated cells (46, 102).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	296	 These calculations and assumptions yield estimates of 1 to 10 channels per vesicle in these systems; they are not likely to provide more than one order of magnitude estimate of channel density.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	297	 The mean oocyte current and capacitance changes reported by Weber et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	298	 (105) were both approximately fourfold smaller than those in the Takahashi study (102) so that the calculated outcome would be unaffected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	299	 (110) estimated the number of Na-dependent glucose transporters per oocyte vesicle at 10 to 20, based on freeze-fracture scanning electron microscopy.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	300	 The size of the imaged oocyte vesicles was 100 to 120 nm.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The value of 1 to 10 CFTRs per vesicle is instructive when considering whether one should be able to visualize vesicular GFP-CFTR by light microscopic methods.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	302	 As discussed earlier in this article, the sensitivity of GFP detection (79), together with these considerations, suggests that CFTR density in a single transport vesicle is near the limit of detection.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It is worth emphasizing that the source of CFTR current generation, whether membrane-resident or inserted channels, need not be a black-and-white issue.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In most systems, plasma membrane CFTR currents are likely to arise from both stimulation of membrane-resident channels and acutely trafficked CFTR channels, and the proportions of these may differ among cell types or experimental conditions (see CONSEQUENCES OF REGULATED CFTR TRAFFICKING).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Data from studies of the regulated trafficking of GLUT-4 or AQP-2 indicate that they undergo recycling even under basal conditions (15, 17).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	306	 During stimulation, the rate coefficients of the steps involved in recycling these proteins are altered, changing their distribution to increase the number of transporters and/or channels in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Presumably, regulated CFTR recycling behaves similarly.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	308	 As appears to be true of CFTR, the cellular background that can support regulated GLUT-4 or AQP-2 trafficking is very important.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Thus the expression of GLUT-4 in nonmuscle or nonadipose derived cells eliminates the insulin-regulated redistribution of GLUT-4 (40, 44).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Similarly for AQP-2, its endogenous expression in vas deferens results in a constitutive apical membrane localization; the channel is not found in a cAMP/PKA-regulated internal compartment as it is in renal epithelia, and there is no effect of stimulation on apical channel density (99).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	311	 A requirement for the proper cellular context is likely to also characterize the regulated trafficking of CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The AQP-2 data suggest that such differences can exist not only between epithelial and nonepithelial cells but also between epithelial systems.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	313	 This conclusion underscores the need to determine which cellular components provide the proper context.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	316	 SUMMARY APPENDIX REFERENCES   The studies discussed above do not provide a mechanistic basis for the CFTR-dependent proteins and regulatory events involved in the control of CFTR distribution at the apical membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Positive reports of regulated CFTR trafficking (increased exocytosis, decreased endocytosis, and increased endosome fusion) have indicated that these events require both the expression of CFTR and its stimulation by cAMP/PKA.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	318	 In addition, with the exception of Xenopus oocytes, these processes appear to be epithelial cell specific.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In view of the relatively recent discovery of the extensive interactions of CFTR with other proteins, speculation regarding possible molecular mechanisms governing at least some of these trafficking reactions seems warranted.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn at this stage, the principal value of the models we propose is to suggest testable hypotheses that may lead to an understanding of mechanism.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Moreover, it is our contention that the importance of regulated CFTR trafficking for anion secretion will continue to generate controversy until its mechanistic basis is understood to the extent that it can be manipulated experimentally (e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	322	, in the same manner that identification of adapter protein interactions with CFTR has provided a mechanistic basis for CFTR endocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	323	 The physical interaction between the CFTR COOH terminus and the  micro2 subunit of the AP-2 adapter complex, indicated by the results of recent studies (108), suggests a model like that shown in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	324	 2 for PKA-mediated regulation of endocytosis.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	325	 This scheme is based on observations concerning the inherently rapid rate of CFTR-dependent endocytosis and the inhibitory effect of cAMP on this process (13, 14, 61, 85).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	326	 It assumes that CFTR is normally endocytosed at a rapid rate because of its interaction with the AP-2 adapter complex at the YDSI motif of the COOH terminus.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Recent data indicate that this interaction requires also phosphorylation of the  micro2 subunit, which facilitates AP-2 interactions with membrane lipids (25).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	328	 2 implies that the PKA-mediated inhibition of CFTR endocytosis may result from occlusion or obstruction of the adapter protein binding site at the COOH terminus by a CFTR phosphorylation event.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	329	 For example, this could result from an as yet unidentified physical interaction of the phosphorylated R domain with the COOH-terminal tail where adapters bind, or it could be mediated by another interacting protein whose association with the COOH terminus is proportional to CFTR phosphorylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The key feature of this model relies on phosphorylation-dependent accessibility of the COOH terminus site for adapter protein binding.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	331	A second possibility is that the YXX motif itself is altered by phosphorylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	332	 In species where CFTR's sequence has been described, the YDSI motif is highly conserved (108).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Although it does not conform to a canonical PKA consensus sequence, it is possible that the Y+2 serine is phosphorylated by PKA or another kinase, which acts to disrupt the adapter binding motif.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	334	 The possibility that AMP kinase, implicated in binding to this region of CFTR (39), is involved in phosphorylation of the YDSI internalization motif requires evaluation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	335	 However, the function of this kinase is presumably to downregulate CFTR during metabolic stress, which would be expected to promote, not inhibit, CFTR retrieval.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Nevertheless, a phosphorylation event at or near this site could reduce the endocytic rate of CFTR in parallel with the activation of channel gating.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	337	 It remains to be determined whether such a mechanism can account for the finding, made in both epithelial and nonepithelial systems (13, 14, 85, 94), that PKA phosphorylation inhibits CFTR endocytosis, leading to retention of the channel on the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	338	 What determines the ability of CFTR to enter a regulated (as opposed to constitutive; Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	339	 1) secretory pathway during its progression to the cell surface? In Xenopus oocytes, a redistribution of CFTR between intracellular and plasma membrane compartments is demonstrable by immunofluorescence measurements, as discussed above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	340	 These data can be interpreted to suggest that CFTR is stabilized, kinetically, in an intracellular compartment under nonstimulated conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Therefore, it is reasonable to ask what structural feature(s) of CFTR provides for its entry into a regulated secretory pathway under basal conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	342	 CFTR carries its own regulatory domain, and the phosphorylation of this domain stimulates both channel gating and trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Therefore, it is logical to ask whether the R domain is responsible for the entry of CFTR into a regulated pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	344	 For this purpose, CFTR lacking the R domain has been expressed from two injected RNAs, each corresponding to a CFTR half molecule: N-TM1-NBD1 and TM2-NBD2-C (56).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Oocytes expressing these constructs showed spontaneous currents quantitatively similar to the stimulated currents of cells expressing wt CFTR, and they were not further augmented by cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	346	 In addition, there was no change in membrane capacitance during stimulation, indicating that regulated CFTR trafficking required the R domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	347	 The direct targeting of R-CFTR to the plasma membrane in these cells is consistent with the concept that the nonphosphorylated R domain may allow CFTR to access a regulated intracellular compartment and that CFTR within this compartment can be redistributed to the plasma membrane when the R domain is phosphorylated.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Therefore, it is reasonable to ask the following: What are the mediators of this process? Do protein interactions involving the R domain govern the movement of CFTR through this regulated trafficking pathway?.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	349	Although these questions cannot be answered with certainty at present, the relatively recent discovery by Kirk and colleagues (72, 73) that CFTR interacts physically and functionally with syntaxin 1A (S1A) suggests soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins as candidates for participation in this regulated trafficking process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	350	 The interaction of S1A with the NH2 terminus of CFTR (73, 81) and the inhibition of CFTR currents during S1A overexpression (72) have been interpreted as the consequence of a direct interaction of S1A with CFTR that reduces its open probability (20).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	351	 However, in addition, Peters et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	352	 (81) showed that S1A overexpression decreased the density of CFTR channels in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	353	 They concluded that disruption of SNARE complex formation by overexpressed S1A interfered with CFTR trafficking (presumably with exocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	354	 As regards the functional involvement of syntaxin with CFTR, there is no reason to discount one mechanism in favor of the other; that is, syntaxin may regulate CFTR gating and also function as a component of the machinery that brings CFTR into the plasma membrane, or it may act as a regulator of that process.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	355	How might SNARE proteins be involved in regulated CFTR exocytosis? To pose an answer to this question, we should recount several observations.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	356	 First, the Kirk laboratory has shown that the NH2 terminus of CFTR, to which S1A binds, also interacts with a proximal portion of the R domain in protein binding studies (71).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	357	 A series of basic amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus is thought to mediate this association.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Mutation of these residues altered the magnitude and kinetics of CFTR current stimulation in oocytes and decreased the open probability of single CFTR channels (34), perhaps by interfering with NH2 terminus-R domain interactions that influence CFTR gating.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The NH2 terminus is also the site of S1A binding (73).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Thus it is possible that NH2 terminus-R domain interactions influence the association of CFTR with S1A or that it affects the ability of S1A to interact with other proteins necessary for CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	361	In relation to another possible scenario, we recently reported physical and functional interactions of another synaptic terminal protein, the cysteine string protein (Csp), with CFTR (115).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Csp is a resident of synaptic vesicles, and its knockout interferes with regulated neurotransmitter release (116), as does a S1A knockout (111).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	363	 In protein binding studies, Csp interacted with both the CFTR NH2 terminus and R domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	364	 It seems likely that the interactions of S1A and Csp with the NH2 terminus and the additional interactions of the NH2 terminus and Csp with the R domain may provide a means for linking proteins involved in regulated membrane trafficking to the regulatory (phosphorylation) status of the R domain (similar in general concept to the proposal above for regulated CFTR endocytosis).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	365	 According to the model shown in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	366	 3, phosphorylation of the R domain would alter these protein interactions in a manner that would lead to SNARE protein associations appropriate for fusion of CFTR-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	367	 It is also of interest that Csp can bind to several SNARE proteins, including S1A, syntaxin 4, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) and that Csp has been proposed as a modulator of SNARE protein interactions (19).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	368	 According to this concept, NH2 terminus-R domain interactions within CFTR can alter single-channel properties, but they may also couple the phosphorylation-dependent activation of CFTR channel gating to proteins that regulate CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	369	 It is possible that a protein such as Csp, through its ability to interact with SNARE proteins on one hand and with both the NH2 terminus and R-domain of CFTR on the other, provides a transduction mechanism for coupling CFTR channel activation to channel trafficking mediated by the SNARE machinery.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	384	 The most obvious consequence of regulated CFTR insertion/retrieval processes is that the distribution of CFTR between intracellular compartments and the apical plasma membrane will vary with agonist stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	385	 The analogy of this process to other examples of transporters whose overall plasma membrane activity is modulated by trafficking, such as the vasopressin-stimulated AQP-2 water channel or the insulin-dependent GLUT-4 transporter, have been cited throughout this article.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	386	 For CFTR, there is no doubt that the gating of this channel is regulated by phosphorylation when the channel is already present in the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Why, then, should the trafficking of CFTR also be regulated? Control of insertion/retrieval is a common mechanism for regulation of transporters having slow activation kinetics.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Control of channel number would provide for amplification of the secretory response to agonist while preserving an option to sequester CFTR within a compartment where it cannot affect the plasma membrane Cl conductance.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	389	 High intracellular salt levels can be deleterious to cells, whose intracellular ionic composition and volume must be closely regulated (30).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	390	In addition, the contribution of trafficking events to anion secretion may vary with the differentiation status of the epithelium (6, 37).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	391	 It has been found, for example, that CFTR in some epithelial cells does not find its way to the plasma membrane until the tight junctions have formed and the cells polarize (68).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	392	 As the epithelium is developing, cells may utilize regulated trafficking as a means to fine tune the apical Cl conductance until the expression levels of other transporters, metabolic or regulatory components, on which overall secretory or absorptive ion movements depend are expressed at appropriate levels.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	393	 At that stage, the mature cell may find it reasonable to better anchor CFTR in the plasma membrane by virtue of PDZ domain (69, 97) and other interactions, to shift the balance of channel distribution in favor of the plasma membrane.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Yet, even in well-differentiated native epithelia, significant CFTR trafficking signals can be demonstrated (see REGULATED CFTR TRAFFIC).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Not until we know, from a mechanistic viewpoint, the protein interactions that mediate CFTR trafficking events will we be able to determine how such a balance is achieved or how it may be perturbed to counter the effects of disease.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	406	 These authors concluded that F508 CFTR is more rapidly internalized and perhaps targeted to a degradation pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	407	 The parallel study of Sharma et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	408	 (95) reached a similar conclusion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Mutant CFTR was encouraged to escape the ER with the use of a combination of reduced temperature and chemical chaperone (glycerol) treatment.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	410	 They observed also a rapid degradation rate of F508 CFTR, which they attribute to decreased conformational stability: the protein was more susceptible to aggregation and protease digestion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	411	 These authors favor the concept that folding defects of this CFTR mutant persist in the mature, post-Golgi protein (most studies agree that it lacks normal channel gating kinetics and open probability; c.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	412	 92) and that this leads to its more rapid degradation, perhaps by ubiquitin-proteasome pathways.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	413	 It is also possible, in view of the model for regulated CFTR endocytosis illustrated in Fig.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	414	 2, that the rapid degradation of F508 CFTR reflects its more rapid endocytic rate (41, 95), increasing its exposure to degradation mechanisms.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	415	 It is evident from these findings that the altered stability of mutant CFTR in distal trafficking pathways will require attention should rescue of F508 CFTR from ER degradation pathways be an achievable therapeutic target for CF disease.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	416	Another interesting disease mutation that influences distal pathway CFTR trafficking has been identified by Silvis et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	417	 These investigators searched the mutation database for disease mutations that may lead to increased CFTR endocytosis through creation of an endocytic motif.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	418	 The N287Y mutant resides in the second intracellular loop of CFTR and results in mild disease when expressed in combination with F508 CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	419	 This mutant did not exhibit a folding defect, because the N287Y and wt CFTRs showed similar maturation kinetics.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	420	 However, there was roughly 50% of the mutant at the plasma membrane at steady state relative to wt CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	421	 An increased colocalization of the mutant with the endocytic marker EEA1 suggested that this mutation alters the distribution of CFTR between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Cl transport was reduced in proportion to altered cell surface CFTR, but the single-channel properties of N287Y were similar to those of wt CFTR.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	423	 Biotinylation experiments showed that N287Y CFTR was internalized approximately twice as fast as wt CFTR, which is expected to alter its distribution between plasma membrane and intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	424	 These findings provide evidence of disease mutations where the primary defect lies in altered kinetics of CFTR recycling at the plasma membrane, resulting in subnormal apical membrane CFTR levels.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	426	 A second consequence of regulated CFTR trafficking is that intracellular CFTR distribution may vary with the secretory status of the epithelium.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Despite indications that intracellular CFTR channels can be activated by cAMP/PKA (9, 77), the model of Barasch et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	428	 (5), suggesting that vesicular CFTR activity alters internal compartment pH, cellular glycoprotein processing, and bacterial colonization, has not been supported by subsequent studies (32, 35, 60, 83).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Nevertheless, there is a fundamental need for resolving the causes for increased bacterial adherence to CF cells and their glycoprotein secretory products and for the preferential binding of P.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	431	 These findings argue that the deletion of CFTR from the distal secretory pathway influences epithelial cell surface chemistry.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	432	 These properties of CF cells and their secretions could be affected by CFTR-dependent membrane trafficking events in intracellular compartments as well as at the plasma membrane domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	433	 (8) demonstrated that CFTR promotes endosome-endosome fusion, and, as with plasma membrane CFTR redistribution, this required both CFTR expression and cAMP stimulation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	434	 If the presence of CFTR in internal membranes alters patterns of posttranslational glycoprotein modification by changing the compartmentation of enzymes or substrates involved in these processes (78), the surface chemistry of CF cells may be affected.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	435	 An issue related to the above discussion concerns the role of CFTR in epithelial tissue protein secretory activity, which is largely suggested by the data of McPherson and colleagues (65, 67), who examined mucin and amylase secretion by salivary glands of control and CF patients.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	436	 Metabolic incorporation of isotopic label into the carbohydrate residues of mucins was used to quantitate secretory rates.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	437	 The results showed that the -adrenergic stimulation of mucin and amylase secretion was reduced 60% in submandibular salivary glands derived from CF subjects.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	438	 An extensive series of studies showed that alterations in signal transduction mechanisms were not responsible for this difference and that the mucin content of control and CF glands was similar.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Recently, similar results have been obtained by using the salivary glands of CFTR knockout mice (67).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Again, the cAMP-dependent secretory component of secretion was impaired.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	441	 (66) have performed experiments of this type in several human airway cell lines.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	442	 They demonstrated independent regulation of 14C-labeled glycoconjugate secretion by PKA and PKC pathways (i.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	443	 The PKA agonist isoproterenol increased mucin release by 40% in control cells, but this effect was virtually eliminated (reduced to 3% stimulation) in cells derived from CF subjects.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	444	 A difference in PKC-mediated secretion between control and CF cell lines was not detected, similar to the observations of Bradbury et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	445	 (13) on cAMP-regulated membrane trafficking in T84 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	446	 Moreover, the attenuated PKA response in CF airway cells could be restored by adenovirus-mediated CFTR expression.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	447	 The results suggest that CFTR can play an important role in cAMP-mediated glycoconjugate secretion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	448	 Although not explicitly implicating CFTR in mucin release, the studies of Kuver et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	449	 (54) have demonstrated cAMP-dependent regulation of protein or mucin secretion in CFTR-expressing canine gallbladder epithelial cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	450	 CFTR was detected by immunostaining on mucin granule membranes.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	451	In studies that may have implications for epithelial protein secretion, Yilla et al.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	452	 (112) examined the influence of vacuolar H-ATPase inhibition on the constitutive protein secretory pathway in HepG2 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	453	 Although treatment with concanamycin B did not influence ER-to-Golgi transit, the kinetics of protein traffic between the Golgi and plasma membrane were significantly impaired.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	454	 The secretion of albumin, 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin was delayed, and processing of N-linked glycans by sialyltransferases was inhibited, resulting in the secretion of less extensively modified glycoproteins.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	455	 This study implicates intracellular compartment acidification in the sialylation and N-linked glycan modification of secreted glycoproteins and with the rate of protein secretion.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	456	 In a related study, Jilling and Kirk (50) demonstrated that cAMP increased the secretion of several proteins, including 1-antitrypsin, into the apical but not the basolateral compartment of T84 cells.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	457	 This effect was Cl dependent and resulted also in an increase in protein sialylation.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	458	 An involvement of CFTR in regulated exocytosis could underlie the differences in protein secretion observed in studies of cells and/or tissues derived from normal and CF patients or CF knockout mice.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	459	 Once we understand the reasons for the ability of CFTR to alter membrane traffic, it may become apparent that the underlying mechanisms involved in the progression of CFTR between different compartments have certain features in common.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	460	 A critical question in this regard concerns the exit of CFTR protein from the ER.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Reasons for thinking along these lines include the common features controlling vesicle transit along compartments of the secretory pathway, e.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	462	, a combination of SNARE and coat protein associations, which often involve interactions with the cargo being conveyed (3).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	463	Our recent findings regarding Csp interactions with CFTR (115) also may provide an example of how common trafficking events may occur in the early and later components of the protein secretory pathway.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Csp regulates exocytosis in neurosecretory cells, and implications for a similar role in CFTR exocytosis were discussed above.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	465	 In addition, Csp plays a role in CFTR maturation in the ER.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	466	 Csp antibodies co-precipitate a large proportion of band B CFTR and localize Csp protein to the ER, in addition to its presence at the apical domain.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	467	 The major influence of Csp overexpression was a disruption of the biogenesis of mature CFTR (band C).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	468	 Because Csp is an Hsc70 binding protein, which also binds to CFTR, it is likely that Csp serves as a CFTR co-chaperone.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	469	 Csp overexpression may decrease CFTR biogenesis by prolonging its association with Hsc70, which can lead to CFTR degradation (88).
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	470	 Much work needs to be done to determine the role of Csp in CFTR maturation, but it is interesting to speculate that the steps involved in the egress of nascent CFTR from the ER and from a regulated compartment of the distal secretory pathway to the plasma membrane may involve similar protein interactions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Therefore, identifying the mechanisms underlying stage-specific CFTR trafficking events may also shed light on traffic occurring at other compartments of the cell.

0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	475	 On balance, there is good evidence that epithelial cells exhibit regulated CFTR trafficking as a mechanism to increase the density of CFTR channels at the cell surface.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	476	 This process may contribute to the cAMP-dependent secretion of proteins contained within this trafficking compartment.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Some results that show a lack of regulated CFTR trafficking may be attributable to the use of overexpression systems or nonphysiological experimental conditions.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	478	 Yet, there are other findings that cannot be similarly rationalized, and this may reflect the need for expression of the right set of interacting proteins, perhaps some of them as yet unidentified.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	479	 The finding that disease mutations influence CFTR trafficking events in the distal protein secretory pathway and thereby contribute to the CF phenotype further supports the concept that regulated CFTR recycling is important for normal epithelial function.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	480	 The era of CFTR interactions with other proteins, particularly with recognized traffic regulatory components, is beginning to shed light on the potential mechanism of regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	481	 We suggest testable hypotheses (Figs.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	482	 2 and 3) regarding the manner in which CFTR phosphorylation may alter protein interactions and thereby affect the distribution of CFTR between apical membrane and intracellular compartments.
0.65036243.12777252.html.plaintext.txt	483	 Yet, it is likely that controversy regarding the significance of this process will continue until we can identify the specific components of the CFTR-dependent trafficking machinery, permitting their expression or activity to be modulated experimentally in polarized epithelial cells and, ultimately, in the organism.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	15	THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated Cl channel and is responsible for regulating ion transport in many tissues where it is expressed, including the airways and airway submucosal glands, sweat glands, gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic and bile ducts, and the reproductive tract (58, 74).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Defective CFTR function disrupts ion transport, which is believed to contribute to the clinical sequelae characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF) (49, 58, 67, 74).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	17	 CFTR regulation in vivo is accomplished through ATP binding and hydrolysis at nucleotide binding domain-1 and -2 and regulation of the phosphorylation status of the regulatory domain (10, 11, 36).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This process is complex and depends on cAMP production through surface receptors that couple to adenylyl cyclase, cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity (40, 41), domain-domain interactions within the CFTR (55), protein-protein interactions between the CFTR and associated regulatory proteins (31, 32, 54, 64), and direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the regulatory domain by protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatases (6, 11), respectively.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Receptor-based pathways that signal through cAMP are therefore relatively accessible candidates for promoting activation of the CFTR in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This has been established for 2-adrenergic receptors, which are commonly stimulated in assays to detect CFTR-dependent Cl secretion as measured by changes in the nasal potential difference (PD) in mice and in humans (44).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	21	Adenosine (Ado) is a Cl secretagogue that signals through P1 purinergic receptors, and recent studies have demonstrated that A2B Ado receptors (ARs) can tightly couple to CFTR through PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In Calu-3 cells, part of this coupling is due to compartmentalized signaling of CFTR with adenylyl cyclase and PKAII through A kinase anchoring protein interactions (34, 71).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	23	 T84 cells also express A2B-ARs, where they have been shown to mediate neutrophil-stimulated Cl secretion (48, 70).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Studies (2-4) have also suggested a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in Ado-activated Cl secretion in T84 cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The nature of this role and whether similar signaling contributes to CFTR activation in other CFTR-expressing cells and tissues, however, are unknown.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	26	In this report, we describe CFTR regulation by A2-ARs in vitro and in vivo and evaluate the contribution of cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) to A2 receptor signaling in airway cells and the murine airway.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Our findings suggest that A2 receptors maximize CFTR activation by signaling through both adenylyl cyclase-PKA and cPLA2 and that components of these receptor signaling pathways can activate common disease-causing CFTR mutations.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	352	In this report, we investigated the cellular pathways utilized by Ado to activate CFTR-dependent ion transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Using a series of experimental systems, including single cells, polarized cell monolayers, and in vivo measurements in cftr(+) and cftr(/) mice, we demonstrated that Ado, through A2-ARs, activates CFTR-dependent halide transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	354	 These receptors are expressed in human airway cells and signal in part through cAMP and PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	355	 We also demonstrated the dependence of this signaling pathway on PLA2 activity in vitro and in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Finally, we showed that the two most common disease-associated CFTR mutations can be activated by A2B receptors alone (F508 CFTR) or by using messenger pathways stimulated by A2B receptors (G551D CFTR).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	357	 These results help to establish the physiological role of Ado-stimulated Cl secretion in vivo and may identify new targets for improving the function of mutant CFTR molecules.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	358	Ado is a ubiquitous signaling molecule, serving protean functions ranging from regulation of neurotransmission to cardiovascular tone and inflammation in many organ systems.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Our results, together with those of other investigators, indicate an important role for Ado as a regulator of CFTR.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	360	 Ado and A2 receptors are potent activators of Cl secretion in primary human airway cell monolayers, in addition to canine and gerbil airway cells and T84 intestinal cells (28, 46, 59, 70).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	361	 In each of these systems, Cl secretion has been accomplished in the setting of low cAMP levels.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Part of this high efficiency is due to compartmentalization of A2B receptors, transduction proteins, and CFTR (34, 71).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Our results suggest that in addition to spatial compartmentalization, efficient transduction between A2 receptors and CFTR involves cPLA2 activation and AA signaling.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	364	 A2 receptors, including A2A and A2B subtypes, classically signal through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, and, ultimately, PKA (56).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Although A2A receptors appear to hold more strictly to this observation, A2B receptors have been shown to stimulate additional signaling pathways such as phospholipase C, direct regulation of calcium channels, and, in our experience, PLA2 (26).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	366	 These observations are of particular interest because recent studies (27) have demonstrated abnormal lipid profiles, including elevated AA levels, in murine CF tissues.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Our findings demonstrate that lipid signaling may be important to the regulation of CFTR activity by Ado in vitro and in vivo.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	368	 The present results therefore set the stage for future studies designed to test the relationship between membrane lipid composition, A2 receptors, and CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	369	There are two general classes of PLA2 enzymes: cPLA2 (three subtypes) and secretory PLA2 (seven subtypes) (33).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Both are expressed in many tissues including the lung and leukocytes.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	371	 cPLA2 translocates to cell membranes after activation and primarily releases AA from membrane lipids.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	372	 cPLA2 has been shown to play an important immunologic role in human airway epithelial cells, governing AA release from epithelia after immunostimulation (76).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Studies (50) have also observed dysregulation of PLA2 in the CF airway, with increased AA release seen after bradykinin exposure in F508 CFTR-expressing airway cells compared with normal control cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	374	 AA is the parent molecule of two important inflammatory signaling cascades including 1) the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, which leads to the production of prostanoids and thromboxanes and 2) the lipoxygenase pathway in which AA is metabolized to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and the leukotrienes A4-E4.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Clinical studies suggest that products of AA metabolism, including proinflammatory species, have direct relevance to CF-related inflammation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	376	 The COX-1 inhibitor ibuprofen is routinely used in the pediatric CF population to reduce lung inflammation and slow the progression of CF lung disease (45).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	377	 Glucocorticoids, which suppress COX-2 expression, have also been studied in CF clinical trials, attenuating the decline in pulmonary function in pediatric CF patients (25).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	378	 The relevance of AA signaling pathways to CFTR activity and ion transport, however, has not been previously demonstrated.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Our results suggest that a buildup in AA may have beneficial effects on CFTR activity in the context of its activation by surface receptors.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	380	The mechanism by which A2 receptors activate CFTR-dependent Cl transport is complex.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	381	 CFTR activation by A2 receptors could be blocked by either PKA or cPLA2 inhibition (Fig.

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	383	 Although 10 min of high-dose (100  microM) AA exposure could stimulate some cAMP production in the two airway cell lines (primarily Calu-3 cells, likely through the actions of distal metabolites such as PGI, PGE2, PGF2 or PGD) (73), it failed to augment cAMP production by Ado or acutely activate CFTR when used alone (COS-7 or Calu-3 cells; Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	384	 These results suggest that the additional effects of AA on CFTR-dependent halide transport were not through influences on total cellular cAMP.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Rather, A2 receptors appear to activate both adenylyl cyclase and cPLA2 in parallel, with each signaling pathway contributing to the maximization of CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	386	 PLA2 signaling was not necessary to activate CFTR through receptors, however, because 2-adrenergic stimulation activated CFTR-dependent Cl transport in vitro and in vivo despite cPLA2 inhibition (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	387	Figure 12 is a summary model that provides three possible mechanisms by which cPLA2 and AA could contribute to A2 receptor activation of CFTR.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	388	 It is possible that Ado and/or AA exerts its effects in part by activating K+ channels and increasing the driving force for halide efflux.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	389	 AA has been shown to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on epithelial K+ channels, and modulation of basolateral K+ channel activity can strongly influence transepithelial Cl transport (20, 21).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	390	 In related experiments, Ado-activated halide efflux in CFTR-expressing COS-7 cells was not reduced by two K+ channel blockers, including barium and tetraethylammonium (10 mM each) (18, 19).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	391	 These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of Ado on CFTR seen in our studies were independent of K+ channel activation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	392	 The observation that AA augmented the stimulation of CFTR by Ado and forskolin (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	393	 5 and 11), but failed to stimulate CFTR alone in vitro (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	394	 5), suggests that AA may exert a permissive effect on CFTR activation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Membrane-derived fatty acids, including AA and its metabolites, have been demonstrated to interact with ion channels and influence their activation by other signaling molecules, including nucleotide sensitivity of ATP-activated K+ channels (5, 65), light-sensitive transient receptor potential, and transient receptor potential-like channels (14), small Cl channels in rabbit parietal cells (61), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (9), and calcium channels as part of oscillating calcium currents (51).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	396	 AA does interact with CFTR and alter its Cl channel activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Cytoplasmic AA produces a flickery block of CFTR in inside-out membrane patches after heterologous expression (1, 35, 47).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Membrane lipids (including AA) can have differential effects on the function of other channels, stimulating channel activity on one surface and inhibiting channel activity on the other (52).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	399	 We speculate that AA or one of its metabolites may interact with an external portion of the channel or with an unidentified regulatory factor that secondarily influences CFTR Cl channel function.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Alternatively, products of AA metabolism could accelerate local cAMP production and, in this way, increase CFTR channel activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	401	 This process would be difficult to detect with total cellular assays to quantitate [cAMP].
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	402	 The effect would need to be quite dramatic, however, because G551D CFTR, which has previously been shown to be poorly responsive to powerful phosphorylating stimuli, appears to be activated by costimulation with AA (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	403	 This occurs despite no detectable change in [cAMP] when combined with Ado (Fig.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	404	 6A) but is most pronounced when combined with PDE inhibition.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	405	 Single-channel-based studies will be necessary to help clarify the mechanism by which cPLA2 and AA promote CFTR activity.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Finally, our results do not exclude the possibility that additional processes may be involved because CPZ has been shown to have effects on other cell signaling pathways in addition to PLA2 (8, 12, 23, 43, 57).

0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	408	   Three potential mechanisms by which A2 receptors signal CFTR activation.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Ado stimulates A2 adenosine receptors (A2-AR), which activate cPLA2 and adenylyl cyclase.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	410	 AA or products of AA metabolism, when combined with cAMP, helped maximize CFTR transport of Cl.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	411	 The mechanism could involve effects on the electrochemical driving force for ion transport through CFTR (i.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	412	, activation of K+ channels) through direct effects of lipid species with CFTR or associated factors (direct effects) or possibly by increasing the rate of cAMP production in the vicinity of CFTR (accelerated cAMP production).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	413	 COX, cyclooxygenase; LO, lipoxygenase.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	414	 7-9 indicate that Ado is a potent Cl secretagogue in vivo, activating CFTR-dependent Cl transport across the murine nasal mucosa more predictably than Iso (when studied at 100  microM).
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	415	 This is of relevance to human nasal PD protocols, which typically use 2-receptor stimulation with Iso to aid in the detection of CFTR-dependent Cl transport.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Our results suggest that comparisons of these two receptor pathways in human subjects may improve the sensitivity of the nasal PD, which could have implications for clinical studies that use this assay to measure low-level CFTR function.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	417	 The importance of PLA2 signaling to Ado activation of Cl transport was also demonstrated in vivo because Ado- but not Alb-stimulated Cl conductance was sensitive to PLA2 inhibition.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	418	A2 receptor signaling may also be useful in improving the activity of disease-related CFTR mutations.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Using an in vitro system, we have demonstrated that CFTR mutations from three subclasses (classes II, III, and IV) can be activated by A2B receptors (17) (Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Although the expression levels of the mutant CFTRs were far higher than those found in vivo, the results shown in Figs.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	421	 10 and 11 support the notion that mutant CFTRs, when localized to the cell membrane, can be activated by endogenous receptor-based signaling pathways.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Current approaches to increase mutant CFTR activity, including improvement of CFTR biosynthesis [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	423	, suppression of premature stop mutations with aminoglycoside antibiotics (7, 15, 75)], increase in trafficking of F508 CFTR to the cell membrane [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	424	, treatment with butyrate compounds (60)], or treatment of surface mutant CFTRs with activating compounds [e.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	425	, genistein or PDE inhibitors (38, 68)] may be complemented by the use of A2 receptor signaling pathways.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Our findings also suggest that common mutant CFTRs should be at least partially responsive to this signaling pathway when available at the cell membrane.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	427	In summary, our studies demonstrate that A2B-ARs are expressed in CF and normal airway cells, localizing predominantly to the apical membrane of polarized Calu-3 cells.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	428	 A2 receptors mediate activation of CFTR-dependent Cl transport in vitro and in vivo, utilizing cPLA2 and AA in addition to cAMP and PKA.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Ado and A2-ARs compare favorably with other agents as activators of CFTR-dependent Cl conductance, stimulating Cl secretion better than the 2-adrenergic receptor agonist Iso in mice and activating F508 CFTR similar to forskolin in vitro.
0.4228028.11741811.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Our studies therefore provide a rationale for the investigation of the effects of Ado and A2 receptor signaling on measured Cl secretion in humans.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, the fate of such internalized CFTR has remained unknown.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Internalized membrane proteins can be either targeted for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Using cell surface biotinylation and antibody uptake studies, we show that CFTR undergoes constitutive endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Expression of dominant negative Rme-1 (a protein that regulates exit from the endosomal recycling compartment) in CFTR-expressing cells results in the expansion of recycling compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Transferrin, a marker for the endosomal recycling compartment, and CFTR accumulate in these enlarged recycling endosomes.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Such accumulation leads to a loss of cell surface CFTR because it is prevented from being recycled back to the cell surface.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, traffic of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is unaffected by the expression of dominant negative Rme-1.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, chimeras containing the extracellular domain of the transferrin receptor and the carboxyl terminal tail of CFTR also enter Rme-1-regulated recycling compartments and accumulate in these compartments containing dominant negative Rme-1, suggesting that in addition to endocytic signals, the carboxyl terminal tail of CFTR also contains intracellular traffic information.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	14	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF), a common lethal genetic disease of Caucasians, results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC superfamily of transport proteins (28).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	15	 CFTR is a cAMP-activated anion channel and channel regulator that functions at the apical membrane of polarized epithelia to regulate secretion in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (37).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Previous studies have shown that CFTR is not a stable component of the plasma membrane but is rather efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (18, 27, 35) through clathrin-coated pits (4, 5).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, such entry of CFTR into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway is mediated by binding of a tyrosine-based endocytic motif in the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (27, 35) to the medium subunit of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex (36).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In addition to endocytic motifs, CFTR also interacts with PDZ-domain containing proteins (29, 32) and AMP kinase (10) at its carboxyl terminus and syntax-ins at its amino terminus (24, 25).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	19	 How all these interactions modulate cell surface expression of CFTR is not clear (2, 22), although morphological, biochemical, and functional data indicate that CFTR is present in cell surface and intracellular compartments in both heterologous expression systems and epithelial cells that natively express CFTR (1, 3, 33).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although much is now known about the mechanisms of CFTR internalization, the fate of internalized CFTR is less well documented.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Previous studies have suggested that internalized CFTR is recycled (31), but the pathway and compartments through which CFTR traverses to undergo recycling are not known.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	22	Endocytosed material is directed initially to a sorting endosomal compartment from which it is directed to one of two destinations.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Some molecules such as the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are retained in the sorting endosome, which matures into and/or fuses with late endosomes (6).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Molecules that are destined to be recycled back to the cell surface are initially targeted to the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) (9, 23).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	25	 While the ERC has been extensively characterized on the basis of studies of transferrin receptor recycling (39) and insulin-regulated recycling of GLUT-4 (14), there are no data concerning the entry of ion channels, such as CFTR, into this compartment for recycling back to the cell surface.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Rme-1 is an epsin homology (EH) domain containing protein (8) recently identified as a key element in controlling exit from the ERC (15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A dominant negative Rme-1 (Rme-1 G429R), when expressed in mammalian cells, has no effect on the endocytosis of integral membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor but dramatically inhibits the recycling of the transferrin receptor back to the cell surface, trapping the receptor in the ERC (15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Endocytosed proteins such as LDL, which are targeted to lysosomes and do not enter the ERC, are unaffected.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We examined the fate of endocytosed CFTR by using dominant negative Rme-1 as a tool for probing transport of CFTR through the ERC.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To monitor recycling of CFTR, we used a modified cell surface biotinylation assay (7, 31, 34).

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Subsequently, the cells were either lysed or rewarmed to 37 degrees C to allow internalized biotinylated CFTR to recycle to the cell surface.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To investigate endocytic recycling of CFTR, we initially confirmed that CFTR undergoes constitutive internalization.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	87	 1A, we observed a linear increase in the endocytic internalization of CFTR between 0 and 8 min.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	88	 After 6-8 min, the amount of apparent CFTR internalization did not increase because CFTR is rapidly recycled back to the cell surface (Fig.

0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	196	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT METHODS AND MATERIALS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It is now clearly established that signals in the carboxyl terminal domain of CFTR direct its entrance into the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (4, 12, 18, 27, 35, 36).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Of interest are the observations that the endocytic internalization kinetics for CFTR are rapid (12, 18, 27, 34) and that internalized CFTR appears to be fully functional (5, 17).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	198	 These observations suggest the possibility that internalized CFTR may be constitutively recycled back to the cell surface.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Indeed, given the rapid internalization kinetics of CFTR, biosynthetic kinetics would have to be equally rapid to maintain steady-state cell surface CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	200	 However, treatment of CFTR-expressing CHO cells with either cycloheximide or brefeldin A did not cause any diminution of forskolin-stimulated CFTR function up to 24 h (16), arguing that internalized CFTR may be recycled rather than degraded.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Studies by Swiatecka-Urban et al.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	202	 (31) have further argued that recycling of CFTR may be important in establishing its apical polarity in epithelial cells.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	203	Although the exit of material from the ERC and its reinsertion into the plasma membrane have been thought to be a constitutive pathway, such traffic nonetheless requires cellular machinery.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The role of Rme-1 in regulating aspects of the endocytic/recycling pathway has been established by using dominant negative mutants in CHO cells and C.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	205	 While Rme-1 has no effect on initial clathrin-mediated endocytic events, Rme-1 function is necessary for proteins to exit the ERC and travel back to the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In contrast, Rme-1 plays no role in the traffic of proteins, such as LDL, to the late endosome/lysosome pathway.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Although there is only one Rme family member in C.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	208	 elegans, there are four related genes in humans (8, 21, 26).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	209	 As yet, the tissue distribution and expression overlap of CFTR with the different Rme-1 genes are not known.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	210	We show that internalized CFTR enters the endocytic recycling compartment on its traffic back to the cell surface in an identical fashion to the well-described marker for endosomal recycling, the transferrin receptor.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Expression of dominant negative Rme-1 has no effect on endocytosis, as shown by uptake of LDL, transferrin, and CFTR/transferrin chimeras, consistent with previously published data (8, 15).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In contrast to traffic of LDL to late endosomes/lysosomes, which is unaffected by dominant negative Rme-1 and shows no colocalization with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1, transferrin (a marker for the recycling compartment) shows almost complete overlap with GFP-tagged G429R Rme-1.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	213	 CFTR localization in dominant negative Rme-1-expressing cells shows overlap with both transferrin and GFP, arguing that internalized CFTR enters the same recycling compartment that transferrin has access to.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The observation that expression of dominant negative Rme-1 caused a marked redistribution of CFTR away from the plasma membrane to being trapped in the ERC argues for a rapid endocytic rate for CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Indeed, several groups have shown that CFTR is efficiently endocytosed from the cell surface (12, 18, 27, 34).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Moreover, the redistribution of CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1 argues that maintenance of steady-state cell surface levels of CFTR is primarily due to recycling of internalized CFTR rather than insertion of newly synthesized CFTR.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The lack of high-affinity antibodies to extracellular domains of CFTR, and the low level of expression of cell surface CFTR in the presence of G429R Rme-1, precluded monitoring of CFTR from the cell surface to the ERC.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	218	 To confirm that entry of CFTR into the ERC was from the endocytic pathway, we monitored access of transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras to the ERC.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Transferrin receptor constructs that lack a cytoplasmic tail are internalized inefficiently (13, 27).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Addition of the carboxyl tail of CFTR to tail-less transferrin receptors restores efficient internalization of the receptor and labeled transferrin reporters (27).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Transfection of cells with transferrin receptor/CFTR chimeras and dominant negative Rme-1 shows that labeled transferrin is trapped within the ERC, arguing that entry into the ERC is from the endocytic rather than the biosynthetic pathway.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Moreover, it argues that the carboxyl tail of CFTR does not contain any signals that direct traffic of CFTR away from recycling pathways to lysosomal degradative compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	223	 While many endocytosed membrane proteins are thought to recycle to the cell surface via a juxtanuclear recycling compartment (23), this is not true for all proteins.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	224	 For example, Kir channels, a potassium channel family involved in regulating membrane excitability (38), do not recycle to the cell surface through Rme-1-regulated compartments (19).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Thus it is clear that different ion channels can traffic and recycle through diverse compartments.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	226	Many laboratories, both commercial and academic, are currently attempting to acquire pharmacological compounds to increase the efficiency with which mutant CFTR molecules fold, exit the endoplasmic reticulum, and get inserted into the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The observation that even wild-type CFTR is rapidly removed from the cell surface argues for the necessity to understand recycling processes with the potential to increase the rate at which CFTR exits the recycling compartment and gets reinserted back into the plasma membrane.
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This is particularly true for F508 CFTR, the most common mutation in CFTR, which even when "corrected" by growth of cells at reduced temperatures has a significantly shorter half-life in the plasma membrane the wild-type CFTR (11).
0.5180734.12839834.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Thus a clear understanding of the molecular events governing the recycling of CFTR will provide inside into ways to augment the overall residence time of pharmacologically corrected mutant CFTR molecules at the cell surface.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	218	 GFP-CFTR is known to be functional and the GFP tag does not affect its trafficking and localization (Moyer et al.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Immunofluorescence study showed that in both cases (endogenous or overexpressed), syntaxin 8 was concentrated in a structure close to nuclear envelope, and a cytoplasm punctuated staining indicated the presence of syntaxin 8 in vesicle-like structures.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Cells overexpressing Syn8TM presented a plasma membrane staining of GFP-CFTR in focal planes (Fig.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	244	 5F), with an intensity level comparable to GFP-CFTR overexpressing cells.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This result evidenced that double transfection did not affect the expression level of exogenous proteins such Syn8TM or GFP-CFTR as compared with cells transfected with only one of these cDNAs.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Thus, we could discount the possibility that the syntaxin 8 inhibitory effect on CFTR trafficking was simply due to an excess of protein biosynthesis in the cell.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	247	Cells overexpressing wild-type syntaxin 8 exhibited a colocalization with GFP-CFTR only in the juxtanuclear region (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	248	 However, accumulation of GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 in this region did not seem to be linked to the coexpression of both proteins, as GFP-CFTR or syntaxin 8 alone also had a strong staining of this organelle near the nucleus.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In the cytoplasm, syntaxin 8 often appeared as dot-like structures corresponding presumably to endosome/lysosome structures, whereas GFP-CFTR appeared more homogenous in the entire cytosol.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	250	 So, apart from juxtanuclear organelles, wild-type syntaxin 8 and GFP-CFTR did not seem to be colocalized in the distal part of cytosol.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	251	 By contrast, the Syn8TM immunostaining pattern colocalized with GFP-CFTR not only in the juxtanuclear area but also in a large part of the cytosol.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Overexpressed (Aa) syntaxin 8 shows a predominantly perinuclear staining and also appears in a cytoplasm punctuated pattern.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	259	These results showed that overexpressing wild-type syntaxin 8, which is anchored on the vesicle membrane, disturbed CFTR trafficking, whereas cytosoluble syntaxin 8 had no or little effect on CFTR plasma membrane localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	260	 As a control, we analyzed the distribution of a plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform (NCX2) (Li et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	261	, 1994), which is not known to interact with SNARE proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	262	 As expected, the surface localization of NCX2 in COS-7 cells was not affected by syntaxin 8 overexpression (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	263	GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 colocalize and are accumulated in recycling endosomes (RE) in COS-7 transfected cells To identify the subcellular compartments in which GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 colocalize, we performed immunofluorescence studies with three well characterized markers of the endosomal and lysosomal compartments on wild-type and doubly transfected COS-7 cells.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	264	 As expected, cells overexpressing GFP-CFTR and syntaxin 8 exhibited a strong staining for both proteins in a juxtanuclear area, a compartment where the two proteins highly colocalize (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Each fluorogram showed that most syntaxin 8 and CFTR fluorescent plots were placed on the bisector line (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This indicated a high degree of colocalization of both proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In each immunostaining experiment, the highest intensity of merged fluorescence corresponded to the juxtanuclear region (data not shown).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Syntaxin 8 immunostaining, whether using the rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	270	 7Ca), gave a classical tubular/vesicular-like pattern.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	271	 GFP-CFTR, as described above, was not localized on plasma membrane but on punctuated and tubular-like structures in the cytosol, and a strong signal was seen on the juxtanuclear area (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Lamp-1 (an LE/lysosomal marker) staining was observed as a strong vesicular and perinuclear pattern (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	273	 7Ac), but its distribution did not colocalize with Syn8 and GFP-CFTR cellular staining (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These data were confirmed by fluorograms showing that Lamp-1 fluorescence distribution was clearly separated from CFTR and Syn8 fluorescences (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	275	 By contrast, TfR immunostaining (endocytosis-recycling pathway) revealed a dot-like vesicular pattern more extensive in the cytosol than Lamp-1 staining (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Intracellular distribution between TfR and CFTR on the one hand (noted TfR/CFTR) and between TfR and Syn8 on the other hand (noted TfR/Syn8) was mostly in distinct compartments within the cell (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	277	 These results were supported by data from fluorograms, which showed two distinct fluorescences in each case.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Several plots with high intensity of overlapping fluorescence suggested a colocalization between TfR and CFTR on the one hand, and between TfR and Syn8 on the other, in vesicular structures near the nucleus (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	279	 When we compared the TfR/CFTR and TfR/Syn8 vesicular pattern in this region (insert), we observed many similarities suggesting that TfR, CFTR and Syn8 were present in the same vesicles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	280	 As the juxtanuclear colocalization between CFTR and Syn8 partially matched to TfR localization, we could identify these vesicles as recycling or post-Golgi endosomes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	281	 To test our hypothesis, we have used a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rab11, a protein that has been found associated with trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes, post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes (Urbe et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In COS-7 cells, endogenous Rab11 displayed a punctuated vesicular pattern scattered throughout the cytoplasm and seemed to accumulate in a tubulo-vesicular structure near the nucleus (Fig.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Finally, in COS-7 cells transfected with GFP-CFTR and Syn8, the Rab11 immunostaining profile matched exactly with CFTR and Syn8 stainings (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	286	 These results were sustained by fluorogram data showing Rab11/Syn8 and Rab11/CFTR fluorescent plots only on bisector line (Fig.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	287	 This clearly showed that these proteins had the same localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In conclusion, when syntaxin 8 inhibits CFTR trafficking in COS-7 transfected cells, CFTR appears to be restricted to a compartment including at least the recycling endosomes and possibly other post-Golgi vesicles.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	327	 However, this interaction was far weaker compared with GFP-CFTR binding to syntaxin 1A.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Nevertheless, these results were significant as CFTR was not retained by GST alone.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Because pull-down experiments revealed a weak physical interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR, we hypothesized that intermediary proteins could be involved in CFTR/syntaxin 8 complexes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	330	 The best candidates were the other components of the endosomal SNARE complex: VAMP8, vti1b and syntaxin 7.

0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	341	   Discussion Top Summary Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We have previously described the molecular cloning of human syntaxin 8 cDNA by the two-hybrid system using the R domain of CFTR as a bait to screen a human fetal lung cDNA library (Thoreau et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	342	 In the present report, we establish the functional relevance of an interaction between these two proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	343	Regulation of CFTR channel activity by syntaxin 8 We have observed that syntaxin 8 overexpression is responsible for a strong inhibition of CFTR channel, activated either by the cAMP pathway (forskolin stimulation) or by a cAMP-independent pathway through the CFTR activator MPB-91 (Derand et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Such regulation of ionic channels by SNARE proteins has already been described.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	345	 For example, physical interactions have been assessed between syntaxin 1A and P/Q-type calcium channels, N-type calcium channels (Bezprozvanny et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	346	, 2000) and amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (Saxena et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Interestingly, syntaxin 1A inhibits CFTR chloride current by direct protein-protein interaction between the t-SNARE homology domain of syntaxin 1A and the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CFTR (Naren et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	348	 In another study (Peters et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	349	, 1999), cAMP-induced delivery to plasma membrane of CFTR present in peripheral vesicles was inhibited by syntaxin 1A in Xenopus oocytes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	350	 As in the case of syntaxin 1A, our electrophysiological data indeed showed an inhibition of the CFTR activity due to syntaxin 8 overexpression.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	351	 This regulation is protein specific, as when we performed the same experiment with syntaxin 3, a SNARE protein that does not bind CFTR, we obtained a normal CFTR activation.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Moreover, CFTR modulation required syntaxin 8 to be anchored in membrane, as we showed that its soluble form has no effect on CFTR activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Thus, CFTR may directly be regulated by a protein-protein interaction, or alternatively, syntaxin 8 overexpression may disturb the vesicular transport machinery.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	354	 This could affect CFTR recycling or cellular targeting towards the plasma membrane and consequently inhibit the chloride channel activity measured at the cell level.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	355	Physical interactions between syntaxin 8 and CFTR We have shown a direct protein-protein interaction, given that CFTR was pulled down using immobilized GST-syntaxin 8 recombinant proteins.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Moreover, CFTR and syntaxin 8 could be co-immunoprecipitated with each other from CHO-2T or HT29-CL19A cell extracts.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	357	 These data suggest that syntaxin 8 interacts with CFTR either directly, or as a component of a CFTR-containing complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	358	 However, this interaction is different from the one observed between syntaxin 1A and CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Recombinant GST-syntaxin 1A binds CFTR with a high affinity (Naren et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	360	, 1997), whereas the interaction between syntaxin 8 and CFTR appears to be weaker.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Moreover, unlike syntaxin 1A in which only the t-SNARE domain interacts with CFTR, each moiety of syntaxin 8 binds CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	362	 Despite the fact that it will be necessary to test the in vitro binding between the different domains of CFTR and syntaxin 8 to ascertain a direct physical interaction, the immunoprecipitation results confirm that syntaxin 8 and CFTR are part of the same complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	363	 As we have precipitated both proteins with the same efficiency in CHO transfected cells and in HT29-CL19A cells (endogenously expressing both CFTR and syntaxin 8), we conclude that this interaction was not induced solely by overexpression.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	364	 As the affinity between syntaxin 8 and CFTR is weak, syntaxin 8 may not be the major partner of CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Tierce proteins may be necessary to establish a protein complex containing syntaxin 8 and CFTR.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	366	 This hypothesis is consistent with the pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments, and could explain the small amount of CFTR retained by GST-syntaxin 8.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Possible candidates partner are the different components of the heterotetrameric endosomal SNARE core complex: vti1b, syntaxin 7 and VAMP8 (Antonin et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Our pull-down experiments suggest that VAMP8 and vti1b, which strongly and directly interact with CFTR, could be partner proteins involved in a CFTR/syntaxin 8 multimeric protein complex.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	369	 This result strengthens the idea that an entire SNARE complex could regulate ion channel delivery/insertion, retrieval or recycling to the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	370	Syntaxin 8 is involved in CFTR trafficking Syntaxin 8 physical binding and functional regulation of CFTR prompted us to investigate, at the cellular level, the effect of syntaxin 8 overexpression on CFTR localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	371	 GFP fluorescence analysis on COS-7+GFP-CFTR cells showed a strong plasma membrane staining characteristic of mature CFTR cellular localization.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	372	 However, when syntaxin 8 was cotransfected with GFP-CFTR, a dramatic decrease or a disappearance of CFTR plasma membrane staining was observed and both proteins colocalized in a perinuclear region.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Syntaxin 8 impact on CFTR trafficking does not apply to any channel as, when we overexpressed syntaxin 8, the plasma membrane localization of endogenous Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was not affected.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	374	Moreover, coexpression of GFP-CFTR and Syn8TM, a cytosoluble form of syntaxin 8 (depleted of its transmembrane domain), led to a normal trafficking of GFP-CFTR to the plasma membrane.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Furthermore, a plasma membrane colocalization between Syn8TM and GFP-CFTR was observed and, interestingly, Syn8TM was seen in the plasma membrane only if CFTR was present too.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	376	 More generally, Syn8TM is located mainly in cellular structures where GFP-CFTR is abundant.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	377	 So, when syntaxin 8 is soluble, it may physically bind CFTR and follow its trafficking, but when syntaxin 8 is anchored in vesicle membrane, it binds CFTR too, but only in the cellular compartment where syntaxin 8 assumes its function (i.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	378	 As Syn8TM had no or little effect on CFTR trafficking, inhibition of CFTR trafficking by syntaxin 8 overexpression could not be related to an excess of protein synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Moreover, syntaxin 8 must be anchored in vesicle membranes to impair CFTR trafficking, which means that the t-SNARE function of syntaxin 8 can be engaged.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	380	 These results reinforce the physiological relevance of a putative regulator role of syntaxin 8 on CFTR channel activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	381	Syntaxin 8 is involved in CFTR recycling pathway The precise identification of the colocalization region of CFTR and syntaxin 8 was determined using fluorescent confocal microscopy and three well characterized antibodies against Lamp-1, an LE/lysosomal marker protein, TfR (transferrin receptor), an EE/RE marker protein, and Rab11, which stains RE and TGN membranes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Our results exhibited no colocalization between Lamp-1 staining and the juxtanuclear compartment where CFTR and syntaxin 8 were accumulated.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	383	 TfR vesicular pattern partially matched with this region, and CFTR, syntaxin 8 and TfR seemed to be located together in thin perinuclear vesicles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	384	 By contrast, Rab11 staining was highly similar to syntaxin 8 and CFTR juxtanuclear staining and we observed a high degree of colocalization both on fluorograms and on the merged image.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	385	 These results indicate that when syntaxin 8 is overexpressed with GFP-CFTR, both proteins are mainly localized in the same compartment, which could be identified as recycling endosomes and/or TGN membranes.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Because we have colocalized CFTR and syntaxin 8 with TfR and Rab11 proteins, we favour the recycling endosome hypothesis.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	387	Syntaxin 8 is a t-SNARE protein that belongs at least to the endosomal SNARE complex (Antonin et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	388	, 2000), and is consequently involved in the endosomal pathway like syntaxins 7, 11 and 12/13 (Prekeris et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Its cellular localization was determined mainly in the early endosome, but syntaxin 8 was also detected in the late endosome and lysosome organelles.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	390	 The early endosome is a dynamic compartment displaying a highly complex and pleiomorphic organization that contains clearly two functionally distinct subcompartments without real physical boundaries: plasma membrane proteins are recycled via the recycling endosomes or degraded via the endosomal carrier vesicles/multivesicular bodies of the degradation pathway (reviewed by Gruenberg, 2001).
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	391	 In some cases, syntaxin 8 was also observed at the plasma membrane (Subramaniam et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	392	, 2000; Kasai and Akagawa, 2001), suggesting a vesicular cycling of syntaxin 8.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	393	The mechanism of CFTR recycling is still poorly understood, but CFTR has previously been detected in recycling endosomes using fluorescence microscopy in human bronchial epithelial cells (Poschet et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Thus, physical binding between CFTR and syntaxin 8 may occur in recycling endosomes, a cellular compartment which is required for CFTR recycling pathway and where syntaxin 8, probably assembled with other SNARE proteins (i.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	395	 endosomal SNARE complex), is implicated in its vesicular trafficking function.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Syntaxin 8 overexpression is likely to disrupt the vesicular transport step in which it is involved, as it has been previously observed for several SNARE proteins (Dascher and Balch, 1996; Low et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	397	 This could explain CFTR accumulation in recycling endosomes in our experiments.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	398	 So our results show that syntaxin 8 appears as an important regulatory protein directly implicated in CFTR recycling pathway.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	399	In conclusion, SNARE proteins, and particularly syntaxin 8, participate actively in CFTR trafficking, recycling and/or in direct regulation of CFTR activity.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Here, we describe a relationship between CFTR and syntaxin 8 in the recycling endosome.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	401	 A recent paper showed that in cystic fibrosis cells a dysfunction in the recycling endosome pathway may have many repercussions on endocytic and plasma membrane processes (Poschet et al.
0.44555384.15039462.html.plaintext.txt	402	 So elucidating the recycling pathway of CFTR could be important in understanding the physiopathology of cystic fibrosis.

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	3	RESEARCH IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) remains at the leading edge of investigations employing human genetics and molecular and cellular biology.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In the 12 years since the discovery of the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel (14), translation of such efforts clinically has been remarkable and includes 1) identification of almost 1,000 different mutations (http://www.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	5	ca/cftr), including 70% with a phenylalanine deletion (F508) that has led to successful clinical detection of individuals with a family history (even before the completion of the human genome project) and 2) ~20 trials of human CF gene therapy involving dosing to the nose or airways (2, 22).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Such rapid progress, however, belies the complexity of the CFTR gene and the pathophysiology of CF.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	7	CFTR is a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family in that it 1) conducts Cl, 2) transports substrates across membranes in a nonconductive fashion (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	8	, facilitates ATP release), 3) regulates other ion channel proteins (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	9	, positive regulation of outwardly rectifying Cl channels or negative regulation of Na+ channels), and 4) regulates intracellular compartment acidification and protein processing (18).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Such complexity has led these authors to categorize defects in CF respiratory epithelium as primary (dehydration associated with dysfunctional Cl transport), secondary (hyperabsorption of Na+), or tertiary (enhanced binding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; proinflammatory environment).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Fundamental to such diversity is the awareness that very minor mutations (e.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	12	, F508, a single-amino acid deletion within a 1,480-amino acid protein) result in the profound pathological phenotype of CF (23).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In the case of F508, the missense mutation results in a mutant CFTR that is believed to fold improperly, and such defects in its biosynthesis and trafficking result in little or no surface CFTR.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Other mutations in CFTR lead to genotypic or phenotypic changes that span the range from no CFTR in the membrane to CFTR that reaches the membrane but does not respond to appropriate stimuli or conduct Cl (6).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Adding to this complexity is a recent report describing tissue-specific changes in the impairment of F508 processing (10).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Some mutations overlap with PDZ-interacting domains on the COOH terminus of CFTR that are required for polarization of CFTR to the apical membrane of respiratory epithelium (13) and may underscore CFTR regulation of other ion channels by affecting the relationship between accessory proteins, linker proteins, and regulatory cofactors.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	17	Accordingly, research into the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and mutated CFTR is at the forefront of CF investigations.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although the defect in Cl conductance is critical to the pathology of CF respiratory epithelia, contributions of alterations in vesicle trafficking, protein processing, and immune function clearly contribute to the pathogenesis and maintenance of CF (18).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These efforts underlie the disparities between genotype and phenotype in CF and suggest that in addition to nucleotide repair (gene therapy, aminoglycoside-dependent restoration of readthrough of full-length CFTR), pharmacotherapy targeted toward improved biosynthesis of mutated CFTR may be a useful adjunct approach to the treatment of CF (24).

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	21	The importance of providing mechanistic support for pharmacologically affecting the maturation of CF is placed in the context of our current molecular physiological understanding of the roles of various chaperones for CFTR by Brodsky (4) in this issue of the American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The steps in proper folding of CFTR, quality control mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum trafficking, and requisite association with various chaperones are outlined by Brodsky and reference is made to three original articles in the Special Topic.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The mechanisms by which sodium 4-phenylbutyrate may be a modulator of such chaperones are presented by Rubenstein and Lyons (17) and Choo-Kang and Zeitlin (5), and the in vivo efficacy of a chemical chaperone, trimethylamine oxide, in the restoration of defective Cl conductance in the critical target tissue (intestinal epithelium) of CFTR null mutant mice is presented by Fischer et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This collective work strongly supports the concept that small molecules are useful alternative or adjunct therapies for disorders of protein folding (23, 24).

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	26	A critical aspect of CF is chronic airway inflammation, and several groups have provided support that dysregulation of the inflammatory response is an intrinsic component of such a phenotype.

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	29	 (21) and highlights the central role of unregulated nuclear factor (NF)-B in the proinflammatory cytokine profile of cells expressing mutated CFTR.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In this regard, blocking the production of NF-B may be an alternative rational therapeutic approach in CF therapy.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition to enhanced cytokine (interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-) production, oxidative stress appears to be a component of CF epithelia.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Previous in vitro work (9, 11) showed that CFTR is associated with the transport of glutathione (GSH).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In the current Special Topic, Gao et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	34	 (8) show that the Cl channel-forming peptide N-K4-M2GlyR increased Cl secretion and GSH efflux in a human CF airway epithelial cell line, suggesting that apical Cl conductance (but not necessarily CFTR function per se) is coupled to GSH efflux.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	35	 (20) report in this issue that GSH was decreased in the epithelial lining fluid of CFTR-deficient mice and that an imbalance in antioxidant defense in CFTR-deficient mice was evident.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These data extend previous observations that GSH was decreased in the airway fluid of humans with CFTR (16) and that aerosol delivery of GSH may be a useful therapy for CF (15).
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	37	 GSH and other cellular defense mechanisms may indeed represent a rational therapeutic strategy in CF.

0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	39	As noted above, Na+ hyperabsorption is a critical secondary-like phenomenon in CF epithelia.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Although the mechanism coupling such hyperabsorption to CFTR mutations remains unknown, an extracellular serine protease-mediated signaling pathway has been identified (19) that activates an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In the Special Topic in this issue, Bridges et al.
0.49680814.11404239.html.plaintext.txt	42	 (3) show that human bronchial epithelial cells are sensitive to aprotinin.

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 forms a Cl channel that is an essential component of epithelial Cl transport systems in many organs, including the intestines, pancreas, lungs, sweat glands, and kidneys.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the Cl secretory intestinal epithelium, Cl enters the cells through a Na+-K+-2Cl cotransporter in the basolateral membrane and exits through CFTR in the apical membrane; water follows osmotically (1).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Absorptive epithelia use similar transporters and channels, but their polarized distribution between the apical and basolateral membranes is usually reversed.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A major determinant of the transepithelial Cl transport rate is the level of activation of CFTR (2, 3), which depends on the extent to which it is phosphorylated.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This is determined by the relative activities of kinases and phosphatases, the activities of which are often hormonally regulated (1).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	9	Defects in the gene encoding CFTR that reduce either its Cl transport capacity or its level of cell surface expression cause cystic fibrosis (CF) (4-6) as well as a form of male sterility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (7).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	10	 CF is the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians, with about 30,000 CF patients in the United States.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In contrast, in intestinal epithelial cells overstimulation of CFTR because of the activation of protein kinases by bacterial enterotoxins causes secretory diarrhea (1, 8).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Secretory diarrhea is the second largest cause of infant mortality in the developing world, causing 3 million deaths per year of children under the age of 5.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, although CFTR was named because of its association with CF, as a cause of disease, its relationship to secretory diarrhea is a more widespread public health problem.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	14	The cloning of CFTR in 1989 (9) has facilitated studies of its structure, function, regulation, biogenesis, and degradation, which will be reviewed in this article.

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	18	CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter gene superfamily that includes both eukaryotic and bacterial proteins, such as the multiple drug resistance protein (MDR), the sulfonylurea receptor, the transporter for antigen presentation, and the bacterial periplasmic permeases (9, 11).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Being an ion channel makes CFTR unique in this gene superfamily in which most other members are ATP-driven membrane transporters.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	20	CFTR contains 1480 amino acids and consists of two homologous halves (Fig.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Each half contains six membrane-spanning segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The two halves of CFTR are linked by a cytoplasmic regulatory domain (R-domain) that contains a number of consensus phosphorylation sites (9).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In the proposed transmembrane topology (Fig.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	24	 1), which is supported by experimental evidence (9, 12, 13), 77% of the protein is in the cytoplasm, 19% in membrane-spanning segments, and 4% in extracellular loops, which (except for the M1-M2 and M7-M8 loops) are very short.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The M7-M8 loop contains two N-linked glycosylation sites that are used in vivo (12, 13).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Covalent linkage of the two halves is not required for assembly and function.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	27	 When expressed as separate proteins in the same cells the halves assembled into functional channels and could be co-immunoprecipitated.

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In contrast, two studies concluded that CFTR is a homodimer in situ based on the size of CFTR particles in freeze-fracture electron micrographs (16) and on the functional effects of coexpressing mutants with distinct functional properties (17).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In the homologous MDR transporter, however, dimers were not seen in cryoelectron microscopic images (18).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	35	Channel-lining Residues-- The channel lining is formed, at least in part, by residues from among the 12 membrane-spanning segments.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The major determinants of the channel's functional properties are likely to be among the channel-lining residues.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Water-accessible residues inferred to line the channel were identified in the M1, M3, and M6 segments using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (19-21).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These segments' secondary structure was inferred to be largely -helical based on the patterns formed by the channel-lining residues (19-21).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Further support for an -helical secondary structure of the membrane-spanning segments was provided by studies of synthetic peptides, the sequences of which corresponded to those of the M1-M6 segments.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These peptides were largely -helical in liposomes and in detergent micelles (22, 23).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	41	The minimum channel diameter was inferred to be ~5.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	42	3 A based on the size of the largest permeant anion (24).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Further studies using patches with larger numbers of channels showed that anions as large as lactobionate (10-13 A in diameter) were slightly permeable.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, at least transiently, the diameter of the channel must be 10-13 A (25).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In the presence of cytoplasmic ATP the large anions were only permeable from the cytoplasmic side (25).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The molecular basis for asymmetric permeation by large anions is unknown.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	47	 There is no asymmetry in the conduction of small anions; the channel has a linear current-voltage relationship in Cl solutions (13).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Although some studies suggested that ATP was permeable through CFTR (reviewed in Ref.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	49	 26), it has been convincingly demonstrated that there is no measurable electrogenic ATP flux through CFTR (27-29).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	50	Mechanism of Charge Selectivity-- The ability to discriminate between Cl and cations is essential for the role of CFTR in epithelial Cl transport.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The extent of anion selectivity, as measured by the Cl to Na+ permeability ratio (30), ranges between 10 and 300 (31, 32).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We showed that the charge selectivity filter that discriminates between anions and cations is located at the cytoplasmic end of the channel and that both anions and cations can enter the extracellular end of the channel (33).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Arg-352, at the cytoplasmic end of M6, is a major determinant of charge selectivity.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Removal of the positive charge at this position reduced the Cl to Na+ permeability ratio approximately 10-fold (34).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We hypothesized that the positive charge of Arg-352 creates an electrostatic barrier to cation permeation.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Near Arg-352 the channel must be narrow enough so that the electrostatic barrier extends across the channel lumen (34).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	57	Halide Selectivity and Multiple Ion Occupancy-- The channel displays modest selectivity between halides.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The halide permeability sequence is I (1.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	59	2), indicative of weak interactions between permeating anions and channel binding sites (30, 32).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Multiple anions can simultaneously occupy the channel, thereby resulting in anomalous mole fraction effects in the single channel conductance in mixtures of Cl and SCN.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	61	 These effects were eliminated in the M6 mutant R347D, and Arg-347, therefore, was hypothesized to be at or near an anion binding site (35).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Arg-347, however, has been shown to form a salt bridge with Asp-924 (36).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Therefore, it is possible that rather than Arg-347 being a binding site itself, structural perturbation caused by the loss of the salt bridge disrupted an anion binding site elsewhere (30).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	64	Channel Inhibitors-- CFTR has few inhibitors and none are of high affinity or specificity (13).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The affinity of the channel blocker diphenylamine 2-carboxylate was reduced by mutating two water-accessible residues in M6.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Mutations of the aligned M12 residues increased diphenylamine 2-carboxylate affinity suggesting that the channel is lined by residues from both halves of CFTR (37).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	67	In contrast to their actions on other Cl channels and transporters, disulfonic stilbenes such as DIDS inhibit only when applied to the cytoplasmic side (38).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Cytoplasmic application of other large anions also caused flickery block of CFTR.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This is further evidence that the channel is asymmetric and contains an anion binding site in the cytoplasmic vestibule (39).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The residues forming the cytoplasmic vestibule remain to be identified, but the cytoplasmic loops probably do not contribute to the vestibule because none of the CF-related loop mutations affected ion conduction (40).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	71	The picture that is emerging is of a channel with a large extracellular vestibule that extends into the plain of the membrane and is accessible to anions and cations from the extracellular side (Fig.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The channel narrows toward the cytoplasmic end where the charge selectivity filter is located.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Finally, there is a short cytoplasmic vestibule that contains an anion binding site.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The channel lining is formed, in part, by residues from the M1, M3, M6, and M12 segments.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Little is known about whether the other eight membrane-spanning segments contribute to the channel lining.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The location of the gate that blocks ion conduction through the channel in the closed state is unknown.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The gate, however, is controlled by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains.

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	87	Two separate processes control the gating of CFTR: 1) phosphorylation and 2) binding and hydrolysis of ATP.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Phosphorylation is necessary for activation, but it is not sufficient.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	89	 After phosphorylation, gating between the closed and open states is controlled by ATP hydrolysis (12, 13, 41).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	90	Phosphorylation Is a Prerequisite for Channel Activation-- The R-domain contains multiple consensus phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase (9, 12, 13, 41, 42).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The more extensive the phosphorylation, the greater the channel open probability (41, 43).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	92	 There appears to be extensive redundancy in the regulatory PKA phosphorylation sites.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Five sites are phosphorylated in vivo, but removal of these sites or all 10 dibasic PKA sites reduced but did not eliminate PKA activation (44).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	94	 CFTR is still phosphorylated after removal of the 10 dibasic sites indicating that phosphorylation at non-dibasic PKA sites is sufficient for channel activation; one such site has been identified (12, 13, 41).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	95	 PKC phosphorylation may be a prerequisite for activation by PKA (45).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Finally, although genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, activates CFTR this occurs through a direct interaction with CFTR and does not involve a tyrosine kinase (reviewed in Ref.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	97	After phosphorylation, CFTR is deactivated by protein phosphatases (41).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Dephosphorylation is largely mediated by protein phosphatases PP2C and PP2A (46, 47).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	99	 PP2C is closely linked to CFTR in the membrane as it could be co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR as well as cross-linked to CFTR by bifunctional cross-linkers, whereas PP1, PP2A, and PP2B could not (48).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	100	Channel Gating Requires ATP Hydrolysis-- Following phosphorylation, opening and closing of the channel is controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis (12, 13, 41).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs do not support channel opening (49).

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	103	3 mM and hydrolyzes ATP at a rate of about 1 molecule/s (50), similar to the rate of channel gating.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	104	 ATP hydrolysis occurs in the NBDs, which contain highly conserved Walker A and B motifs found in other ATPases (9, 13, 41, 49).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	105	A construct lacking the R-domain, CFTR-R, did not require phosphorylation to open and close in the presence of ATP (13).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Adding soluble, phosphorylated R-domain peptide to CFTR-R enhanced its ATP sensitivity resulting in an increased channel open probability (51, 52).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Thus, the R-domain interacts with the NBDs and regulates their ATP affinity.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	108	Structure of a Bacterial NBD-- In the homologous bacterial periplasmic permeases the NBDs and the transmembrane domains are usually separate gene products that assemble during biosynthesis (11, 53).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The histidine periplasmic permease contains two copies of its NBD protein, HisP; each copy has a single nucleotide binding site.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The x-ray crystal structure of HisP was determined (54).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	111	 The sequence conservation between the bacterial and eukaryotic NBDs implies that their structures are similar and that aligned residues perform similar functions in HisP and CFTR.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	112	HisP has a novel structure (54).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	113	 It contains only small regions of structural similarity with RecA and the  and  F1-ATPase subunits.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	114	 HisP is shaped like the letter L (Fig.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	115	 One arm (Arm I) of the L contains the ATP binding site, including the Walker A and B motifs.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Most interactions between the Walker A residues and ATP are via hydrogen bonds between the backbone amides and the ATP phosphates.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	117	 An aspartate at the C terminus of the Walker B motif, aligned with CFTR residues Asp-572 and Asp-1370, in NBD-1 and -2, respectively, was inferred to bind the Mg2+ ion required for hydrolysis.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	118	 CFTR residues Gln-493 and Ser-573 in NBD-1 and Gln-1291 and Glu-1371 in NBD-2 align with the catalytically important residues in HisP that hydrogen bond to a water molecule that in turn hydrogen bonds to the -phosphate.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	119	 This water molecule is thought to attack ATP because its hydrogen bond lies parallel to the P-O bond that is broken during ATP hydrolysis (54).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The adenine base forms a hydrophobic interaction with a single aromatic residue, perhaps explaining the lack of specificity among nucleotide triphosphates that can gate CFTR (49).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	121	The other arm in the HisP structure, Arm II, contains a LSGGQ motif that forms the foundation around which Arm II is built.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Arm II was inferred to interact with the membrane-spanning domains (54).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The residue aligned with Phe-508 in CFTR, the site of the most common CF-associated mutation, lies on an exposed surface of an -helix in Arm II.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	124	Channel Gating and the Sites of ATP Hydrolysis-- The current hypothesis that ATP hydrolysis at NBD-1 opens the channel and ATP hydrolysis at NBD-2 closes the channel to terminate a burst is consistent with the functional effects of mutations in the NBDs (13, 41).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Mutations in the NBD-2 Walker motifs that decrease its ATP hydrolysis rate slow channel closing (55-58).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Similar mutations in NBD-1 reduce channel opening.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The NBD-1 mutations also altered channel closing rates, suggesting there are functional interactions between the NBDs (55-57).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In both the crystal structure and in solution HisP forms a dimer, the interface of which is located along the edge of Arm I (54).
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Thus, direct contacts between the NBDs may be the structural basis for the functional interaction.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Mixtures of ATP and non-hydrolyzable analogs lock channels in the open state.
0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Presumably ATP hydrolysis at NBD-1 opens the channels and binding of a non-hydrolyzable analog at NBD-2 prevents closing (13, 41).

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	146	Attention has focused on the synthesis and degradation of CFTR because many mutations that cause CF, such as F508, lead to the misfolding of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent degradation of CFTR (reviewed in Refs.

0.4315326.10660517.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Only about 30% of newly synthesized CFTR develops endoglycosidase H-resistant mature glycosylation suggestive of translocation from the ER to the Golgi complex (68, 69).

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The protein can exist in three different molecular weight forms of approximately 127, 131, and 160 kDa, representing either nonglycosylated, core glycosylated, or fully mature, complex glycosylated CFTR, respectively.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF) results in the synthesis of a variant (F508-CFTR) that is incompletely glycosylated and defective in its trafficking to the cell surface.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this study, we have analyzed the oligosaccharide structures associated with the different forms of recombinant CFTR, by expressing and purifying the channel protein from either mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or insect Sf9 cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Using glycosidases and FACE analysis (fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis) we determined that purified CHO-CFTR contained polylactosaminoglycan (PL) sequences, while Sf9-CFTR had only oligomannosidic saccharides with fucosylation on the innermost GlcNAc.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The presence of PL sequences on the recombinant CHO-CFTR is consistent with a normal feature of mammalian processing, since endogenous CFTR isolated from T84 cells displayed a similar pattern of glycosylation.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The present study also reports on the use of FACE for the qualitative analysis of small amounts of glycoprotein oligosaccharides released enzymatically.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	12	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Material and methods Acknowledgments Abbreviations References   Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; Boat et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Patients with CF are marked by dysfunctional epithelia due to the absence of functional CFTR chloride (Cl to ) channels at the apical plasma membranes of the affected cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Studies have shown that CFTR is a membrane-associated glycoprotein whose Cl to  channel activity is regulated by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation (Cheng et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Electrophoretic analysis has indicated that CFTR can exist as three different molecular weight forms of approximately 127 kDa, 131 kDa, and 160 kDa, referred to as bands A, B, and C, respectively (Gregory et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Bands A, B, and C represent different glycoforms of CFTR with band A representing nonglycosylated CFTR, band B representing core glycosylated CFTR, and band C representing the mature CFTR with complex glycosylation (Cheng et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These posttranslational modifications of CFTR may represent an important marker of protein processing (Cheng et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The presence of core glycosylated band B CFTR, for example, indicates processing of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while mature band C CFTR with complex glycosylation is representative of processing in the Golgi (Cheng et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	19	The significance of CFTR glycosylation is understood best, however, by studying the mutant F508-CFTR.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The deletion of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508) in CFTR is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (Boat et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	21	 At 37 degrees C, mutant F508-CFTR is synthesized predominantly as bands A and B, suggesting that the variant protein is unable to traffic normally to the Golgi apparatus (Cheng et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For this reason no CFTR chloride channels are detected.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, the processing of recombinant F508-CFTR can revert towards that of wild-type CFTR when the incubation temperature for the cells is reduced to 26 degrees C (Denning et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	24	 At this lower temperature, some CFTR becomes fully processed and is presented at the plasma membrane, as evidenced by the appearance of very small amounts of mature band C CFTR and the detection of cAMP-regulated Cl to  channel activity at the cell surface (Denning et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	25	Studies on the relationship of glycosylation to the function of CFTR suggest that the addition of carbohydrate to CFTR is not a necessary prerequisite for the protein to target to the plasma membrane or to function as a cAMP-stimulated Cl to  channel (Gregory et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	26	, 1993); however, determining the oligosaccharide structures associated with CFTR should contribute to a better understanding of the structure of this complex transmembrane protein and the influence that F508-CFTR has on other cell membrane glycoproteins.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In this study we have analyzed the pattern of glycosylation of the different forms of CFTR (O'Riordan et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 1995) by expressing the channel protein in either mammalian or insect cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We show that the pattern of glycosylation of recombinant CFTR expressed in mammalian cell systems is representative of that which occurs on endogenous CFTR, while CFTR expressed in insect cells is not fully processed.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The different glycosylation forms of CFTR (bands A, B, and C) were expressed at varying levels depending on the cell type used.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	32	 CFTR prepared from lysates of recombinant C127 and CHO cells were predominantly of the fully mature band C form (160 kDa) with a minor component of band B (Figure 1A, lane 2, and Figure 1B, lane 3).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, CFTR prepared from recombinant Sf9 insect cells appeared predominantly as an 131 kDa polypeptide (Figure 1B, lane 2), which is similar in size to the band B form observed in mammalian cells (Figure 1A, lane 2).

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In FACE, 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) is covalently linked with high efficiency by reductive amination to the reducing end of oligosaccharides (Jackson, 1990).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The resulting ANTS-oligosaccharide conjugates have fluorescence emission properties, such that conjugates that have been electrophoretically resolved on high-density polyacrylamide gels are detectable at very low (picomole) levels.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In the case of neutral oligosaccharides, ANTS labeling also confers charge on the labeled conjugate.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Figure 5 shows fluorescent band patterns of ANTS-labeled oligosaccharides released from band C-CFTR following digestion with either N-glycanase (Figure 5A) or endo-ss-galactosidase (Figure 5B).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The oligosaccharides released from CFTR after treatment with N-glycanase alone co-migrated between the trisialo triantennary and asialo tetraantennary oligosaccharide standards.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The N-glycanase to released oligosaccharides from neuraminidase-treated band C CFTR had slower mobility and migrated between the asialo biantennary and asialo tetraantennary oligosaccharide standards (data not shown).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This slower mobility was due to removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase, which affects the charge on the released oligosaccharides.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This data suggests that the oligosaccharide structures present on mature CFTR are no larger than that of the tetra antennary type.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	100	 These oligosaccharide structures are sensitive to endoglycosidase-H, which removes sugars from the high-mannose glycoprotein, leaving one molecule of N-acetylglucosamine attached to asparagine.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Analyses of N-glycans isolated from endogenous or recombinant glycoproteins expressed in insect cells revealed that this innermost N-acetylglucosamine can be subject to fucosylation (Jarvis and Summers, 1989; Kuroda et al.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	105	 To characterize this glycosylation further we analyzed the oligosaccharides released by both endoglycosidase-H and N-glycanase digestion of Sf9-CFTR using FACE.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The oligosaccharides released co-migrated with the oligomannose standards (Figure 6, Table IB), confirming that Sf9-CFTR contained endoglycosidase-H sensitive oligomannose glycosylation.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Oligosaccharides released by Endo-H will migrate faster than the indicated standards, since Endo-H leaves the GlcNAc residue attached to the asparagine of the glycoprotein.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Interestingly, when insect CFTR was digested with N-glycanase, which releases both complex and high-mannose oligosaccharide structures, the main oligosaccharide released had an electrophoretic mobility slightly slower than Man3 consistent with the presence of fucosylated Man3 (Figure 6, lane 1).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This structure is most likely fucosylated in 1 to 6 linkage, since 1 to 3 fucosylation inhibits N-glycanase (Tretter et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Endo-H cannot release either 1 to 3 or 1 to 6 fucosylated structures (Trimble and Maley, 1984), which explains why several bands are visible in the Endo-H lane while one band predominates in the N-glycanase lane.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	112	 This pattern of glycosylation is very similar to what was reported by Kuroda et al.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	114	 This result is also consistent with the fact that fucosylation of insect oligosaccharides occurs on the innermost N-acetylglucosamine, which is only released with N-glycanase treatment, but remains attached to the peptide with endoglycosidase-H digestion.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	122	 To examine whether the presence of polylactosamine glycosylation is a feature only of recombinant CFTR expressed in CHO cells, but does not truly represent the type of glycosylation that occurs on endogenous CFTR, non-recombinant CFTR expressed in T84 cells was characterized.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	123	 To address this issue, CFTR from T84, CHO and Sf9 cells was digested with N-glycanase (Figure 7).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Digestion of band C-CFTR isolated from T84 cells with N-glycanase generated a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 127 kDa (band A).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus, mature CFTR expressed in T84 cells and digested with N-glycanase comigrated with the product of N-glycanase digestion of mature CFTR from CHO cells (Figure 7).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The large reduction in molecular weight after N-glycanase digestion of T84-CFTR suggests that T84-CFTR also likely contained polylactosamine glycosylation.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The occurrence of such glycoforms is not necessarily a result of expression of CFTR in a recombinant cell per se, since endogenous CFTR from T84 cells was shown to have similar characteristics.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	141	 These polylactosaminoglycans (PL) are heterogeneous oligosaccharides and are distinct from the more common complex type asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by having side chains of Galss1 to 4GlcNAcss1 to 3 repeats which are susceptible to endo-ss-galactosidase (Scudder et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	142	The importance of these PL sequences on the mature, fully processed CFTR is as yet unclear.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It was speculated (Beppu, 1992) that IgG autoantibody against Band 3 of the human erythrocyte membrane (anti-Band 3) plays a role in removing senescent or damaged erythrocytes from circulation by recognizing the sialylated poly-N-lactosaminyl sugar chains.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Other suggested functions for poly-N-lactosaminyl structures on Band 3 include shielding potential antigenic sites on external loops and protection of the protein from proteolytic degradation (Casey, 1992).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Likewise, it could be that the presence of poly-N-lactosamine structures on CFTR may help reduce the antigenicity of the protein or maintain the channel in an active form in the membrane by improving its stability or preventing it from being degraded by proteases.

0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	153	, 1992) may be due, in part, to a longer association of the variant protein with the Golgi complex, thereby allowing it to acquire the extended PL structures.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	154	Baculovirus expression of CFTR in the Sf9 insect cell system resulted in the expression predominantly of a protein band that comigrated with that for band B CFTR.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The expression of a band B-like CFTR in the Sf9 cells is consistent with earlier reports indicating that only oligomannose structures are contained on recombinant proteins expressed in this insect cell line (Wojchowski et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	156	, 1987; Greenfield, 1988; Luckow and Summers, 1988) and that little further processing of the original high-mannose oligosaccharide core occurs in these cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Using FACE, we showed that Sf9-CFTR was further modified by fucosylation at the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This confirms the presence of a fucosyltransferase gene in insect cells as first reported by Davidson and Castellino (1991), who demonstrated the presence of fucose on recombinant human plasminogen (r-HPg) expressed in Sf21 insect cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	159	 These investigators were also the first to demonstrate that the addition of complex carbohydrate structures to proteins expressed in insect cells could occur, but was specifically dependent on the infective process employed.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In this present study CFTR expressed in the Sf9 insect cell system had only oligomannose structures; however, it may be possible to manipulate the nature of CFTR glycosylation in these cells by altering the infective process, thus generating fully processed CFTR that is more representative of endogenously expressed CFTR or CFTR expressed in recombinant mammalian cells.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	161	Presently, it is unclear whether these different glycoforms of CFTR exhibit different activities.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Some studies have suggested that the carbohydrate moiety is dispensable for CFTR Cl to  channel activity (Morris, 1993).
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	163	 A mutant CFTR that was altered such that it was now unable to undergo N-glycosylation was shown to retain cAMP-stimulated Cl to  channel activity (Gregory et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Similarly, Sf9-CFTR that lacks complex oligosaccharide structures also exhibited functional CFTR channel activity (Bear et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, other studies have suggested that the state of glycosylation of CFTR may affect its stability at the plasma membrane (Luckas et al.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Clearly, the effect of carbohydrate addition on the structure and function of CFTR requires further investigation.
0.4183819.11087715.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This in turn may have implications for development of relevant therapies for treatment of CF patients harboring the most common form of the disease.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have addressed the role of the  subunit (Sec61) during cotranslational protein translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	5	 With a reconstituted system, we show that a Sec61 complex lacking Sec61 is essentially inactive when elongation and membrane targeting of a nascent chain occur at the same time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The translocation process is perturbed at a step where the nascent chain would be inserted into the translocation channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, if sufficient time is given for the interaction of the nascent polypeptide with the mutant Sec61 complex, translocation is almost normal.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Thus Sec61 kinetically facilitates cotranslational translocation, but is not essential for it.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	9	Using chemical cross-linking we show that Sec61 not only interacts with subunits of the Sec61 complex but also with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), thus demonstrating for the first time a tight interaction between the SPC and the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Interestingly, the cross-links between Sec61 and SPC25 and between Sec61 and Sec61 depend on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes, suggesting that these interactions are induced when translocation is initiated.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We propose that the SPC is transiently recruited to the translocation site, thus enhancing its activity.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	13	IN higher eukaryotes, most proteins are transported across the ER membrane in a cotranslational manner.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The translating ribosome binds tightly to the ER membrane (Connolly et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	15	, 1994), and the growing nascent polypeptide chain is transferred directly from the channel in the ribosome into a channel in the membrane (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975; Connolly et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	16	, 1989; Simon and Blobel, 1991; Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	17	, 1992b; Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	18	The cotranslational translocation pathway in mammals can be reproduced with reconstituted proteoliposomes containing only three membrane protein components: the SRP receptor complex, the translocating chain-associating membrane (TRAM)1 protein, and the Sec61 complex (Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor is required to target a ribosome- nascent chain complex to the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The function of the TRAM protein is still unclear; it is only required for the translocation of a subset of proteins (Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The Sec61 complex represents the essential core of the translocation machinery in the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It consists of three subunits, an  subunit (Sec61) that spans the membrane 10 times, and  and  subunits (Sec61 and Sec61, respectively) that each span the membrane a single time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	23	The Sec61 complex is evolutionarily highly conserved and is proposed to carry out at least three different functions.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	24	 First, it is the major constituent of the protein conducting membrane channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Cross-linking experiments have shown that its  subunit is in continuous proximity of nascent polypeptide chains passing through the membrane (Mothes et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recent electron microscopic data demonstrate that the Sec61 complex can form cylindrical oligomers that presumably represent the channels (Hanein et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Second, the Sec61 complex is tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and is likely to be the ribosome receptor (Gorlich et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Third, the Sec61 complex is involved in a signal sequence recognition event that takes place inside the membrane (Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	30	The role of the Sec61 complex subunits for its different functions is not yet clear.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Whereas the presence of a multi-spanning  subunit in a channel-forming protein complex may not be surprising, the role of the two small single-spanning polypeptide chains remains mysterious.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A particular enigma is the  subunit.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the simultaneous deletion of the  subunits of the two homologous Sec61 complexes (Sec61p and the Ssh1p complex) is not lethal; the cells only show a growth defect at elevated temperatures (Finke et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus, despite the fact that the protein is evolutionarily highly conserved, it does not appear to be absolutely required in vivo.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Posttranslational protein transport across yeast ER membranes in vitro is reduced, but not completely prevented, when the  subunits are lacking.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	36	 At which point the transport process is inhibited, and whether the  subunits play any role in the cotranslational mode of protein transport has not yet been investigated.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	37	The function of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex may not necessarily be restricted to the actual translocation process.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The transport of proteins across the ER membrane must be intimately coupled to their modification and folding, and it seems possible that the  subunit could be involved in interactions between the translocation channel and modifying enzymes or chaperones.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	39	 A physical association of these proteins with the channel may enhance the efficiency of their function.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A good example is the signal peptidase, an abundant enzyme whose active site is in the lumen of the ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Although it can cleave the signal peptide of even completed polypeptide chains, its efficiency is probably much higher when it can act on polypeptide chains that are just emerging from the translocation channel into the lumen of the ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	42	 One may therefore predict its physical association with channel constituents.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The signal peptidase complex is composed of five membrane protein subunits (Evans et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	44	, 1986), two with an active site for enzymatic activity, one with a lumenal domain of unknown function, and two (12 and 25 kD) with cytosolic domains.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The function of the latter is particularly unclear because they cannot contribute to the enzymatic activity on the lumenal side of the membrane, and are not essential for the viability of yeast cells (Lively and Walsh, 1983; Fang et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	46	, 1996; Kalies and Hartmann, 1996; Mullins et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	47	 They would be especially good candidates to serve as linkers to the translocation channel.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	48	In the present paper, we have analyzed the role of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex in the cotranslational translocation pathway in mammals.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Using a reconstituted system, we demonstrate that the  subunit kinetically facilitates, but is not essential for, cotranslational translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The protein does not play a role in the interaction of the ribosome with the Sec61 complex, but rather in the insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Using a bifunctional cross-linker, we also provide evidence that it interacts specifically with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), thus demonstrating for the first time a tight interactions between the SPC and the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Cross-linking is only observed in the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These data thus suggest that, upon ribosome binding to the Sec61 complex, an interaction between the cytosolic domains of the Sec61 and SPC25 serves to recruit the signal peptidase complex to the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Together with the observation that cross-linking between the  and  subunits of the Sec61 complex is also dependent on translocation, these data provide first evidence for structural changes in the translocation apparatus upon initiation of cotranslational translocation.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This leads to a translational arrest when the polypeptide chain reaches a length of ~70 residues.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The membranes were then added at 0 degrees C, conditions that allow efficient membrane binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complexes but no chain elongation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The samples were then warmed up to 26 degrees C to continue translation and concomitant translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	142	 With this protocol, proteoliposomes lacking Sec61 were active in translocation, although their activity was lower by a factor of three compared with the wild-type complex (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Thus, the depleted proteoliposomes are capable to translocate polypeptides if given enough time in the membrane targeting reaction.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The results also indicate that the Sec61 complex lacking its  subunit has not been irreversibly denatured during the prolonged immunodepletion procedure.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	145	 These data suggest that the ribosome-nascent chain complex was targeted to the membrane and thus brought in contact with the signal peptidase, but that a subsequent translocation step was perturbed.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We also found that a fragment of preprolactin of 86 amino acids could be efficiently targeted to reconstituted proteoliposomes and reached a protease-protected state even if Sec61 was lacking (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that insertion of the nascent chain into the Sec61-depleted translocation site can occur if no chain elongation is going on.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	147	It should be noted that in the absence of membranes, almost no full-length preprolactin could be observed (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	148	 1 B, lanes 1 and 9), indicating that under the conditions used, SRP produced a tight translational arrest.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Both the microsomes and the two types of proteoliposomes were able to release the translational arrest (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	150	 1 B, lanes 2-4 and 10-12), indicating that this reaction is not dependent on the presence of Sec61.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	152	Our data suggested that in the absence of Sec61, the binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the ER membrane is less efficient.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This could be due to either a defect in the interaction of the mutated Sec61 complex with the ribosome, or to a perturbed insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation site.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We therefore analyzed whether the  subunit plays a role in ribosome binding.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were incubated at physiological salt concentrations with radioactively labeled ribosomes and increasing amounts of unlabeled ribosomes, both lacking nascent polypeptide chains.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Under these conditions, the ribosomes interact mainly with the Sec61 complex (Kalies et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	157	 To separate the unbound from the bound fraction, the membranes were floated in a sucrose gradient.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Scatchard plot analysis was used to estimate the number of binding sites and the apparent dissociation constants (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Both the depleted and mock-depleted proteoliposomes were found to bind ribosomes with approximately the same binding constant.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Also, the number of binding sites was about the same.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The measured parameters are in good agreement with published data for the binding of ribosomes to PK-RM and proteoliposomes (Kalies et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	162	, 1994), although the dissociation constants seem to be somewhat higher at 26 degrees  than at 0 degrees C.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Thus, steps other than the interaction between SRP and its membrane receptor or the binding of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex must be responsible for the less efficient insertion of the nascent polypeptide chains into proteoliposomes lacking Sec61.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Treatment of RM with high salt or puromycin alone did not change these cross-links (data not shown), suggesting that their disappearance requires the dissociation of the ribosomes into subunits.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In agreement with this assumption, proteoliposomes reconstituted from a crude detergent extract of microsomes or proteoliposomes containing only the purified Sec61 complex, which both lack membrane-bound ribosomes, also did not give these cross-links (Fig.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	244	Taken together, these data provide evidence that the  subunit of the Sec61 complex is involved in ribosome- dependent conformational changes of the translocation channel and that it specifically interacts with the signal peptidase during cotranslational translocation.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	245	    Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials  and  Methods Results Discussion References.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	246	In this paper, we have studied the role of the  subunit of the Sec61 complex during cotranslational protein translocation into the mammalian ER.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We have found that the translocation competence of reconstituted proteoliposomes immunodepleted of Sec61 is greatly reduced when tested under conditions in which membrane targeting and translation occur at the same time.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	248	 However, if ribosomes carrying short nascent chains are first targeted to the membrane before translation is continued, i.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	249	, if enough time is given for their membrane insertion, the depleted proteoliposomes are only marginally reduced in their activity.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These results can be explained by the assumption that elongation of a nascent chain and its insertion into the translocation channel are kinetically competing processes: if the membrane insertion is too slow, elongation of the nascent chain would continue in the cytosol and its folding would prevent a later interaction of the signal sequence with the translocation apparatus.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	251	 We therefore infer that the  subunit is required for a rapid insertion of the ribosome-bound nascent chain into the translocation sites in the ER membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The observation that the  subunit is not essential is in agreement with the fact that the deletion of the two  subunits in yeast cells is not lethal and leads to a growth phenotype only at elevated temperatures.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Since microsomes isolated from the mutant had a reduced activity for posttranslational protein transport, these and the present results indicate that the  subunit plays a role in both pathways, but is not absolutely required in either one.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	254	As the cotranslational translocation process is known in much detail, we have been able to analyze the effect of Sec61 depletion on the various steps.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	255	 One of the first steps is the interaction of the ribosome-nascent chain- SRP complex with the SRP receptor in the membrane that leads to the release of the translational arrest exerted by SRP.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This reaction was not perturbed by the depletion of Sec61, although previous data showed that, for optimal release, both the SRP receptor and the Sec61 complex are required (Gorlich and Rapoport, 1993).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	257	 We therefore conclude that the  subunit is not essential for this activity of the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The binding of ribosomes to the ER membrane was also not affected by the absence of Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Both the number of binding sites and the dissociation constant remained unchanged and were almost identical to the values determined for the reconstituted, purified wild-type Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	260	 These results are consistent with the observation that proteolytic degradation of the cytosolic domain of Sec61 in microsomes does not prevent the binding of ribosomes (Kalies et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Taken together, our results indicate that even in the absence of Sec61, efficient release of the SRP arrest and binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61 complex can occur.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	262	 This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the membrane targeted nascent chains undergo signal peptide cleavage by signal peptidase located in the wrong orientation in the reconstituted membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	263	 It therefore appears that a step subsequent to membrane targeting, most likely the step in which the nascent chain is inserted into the Sec61 channel, is perturbed in the absence of the  subunit.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Structural changes in the Sec61 channel, which may be required for its opening (Crowley et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	265	, 1994; Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995), may occur with a reduced rate.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	266	To further analyze the function of Sec61, we have probed its molecular environment in ER membranes by cross-linking.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	267	 A bifunctional cross-linker was used that reacts specifically with SH groups and therefore can be expected to give a relative simple cross-linking pattern.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	268	 As predicted, in rough microsomes Sec61 was found in close proximity to the  subunit of the Sec61 complex.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	269	 We also found a cross-linked product consisting of two Sec61 molecules, perhaps explained by the occurrence of oligomers of the trimeric Sec61 complex in microsomes (Hanein et al.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Most interestingly, however, a specific cross-linked product containing SPC25 was observed.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Conversely, when the cross-linking partners of SPC25 were analyzed, the only partner outside the signal peptidase complex was found to be Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Remarkably, 70% of SPC25 could be cross-linked to Sec61.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	273	 We therefore believe that the cross-link between the two proteins indicates their specific interaction.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These data provide the first evidence that the signal peptidase physically contacts the protein conducting channel in the membrane.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The cross-linking between Sec61 and SPC25 has likely occurred between their cytosolic domains since the only cysteine in Sec61 is in its NH2 terminus and two appropriately located cysteines exist in the NH2-terminal domain of SPC25 (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	276	 7), previously shown to be cytosolic (Kalies and Hartmann, 1996).
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	277	 SPC25 has almost no amino acid residues in the lumen of the ER where the active site of the signal peptidase resides (Fig.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	278	 7) and its function was therefore obscure.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	279	 On the basis of our data, we propose that it is involved in an interaction with the Sec61 complex to bring the enzyme close to the translocating polypeptide substrate.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, sequestration in the translocation site may not be absolutely essential for its function because the signal peptidase complex is very abundant and can probably reach its substrates by mere diffusion in the plane of the membrane, explaining why neither SPC25 nor Sec61 are essential for the viability of yeast cells.

0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	287	Further evidence for our conjecture that Sec61 may be involved in recruiting the signal peptidase complex to the translocation site comes from cross-linking experiments in which ribosome-stripped membranes were used.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	288	 These membranes gave many cross-link-reduced cross-links between Sec61 and SPC25.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	289	 After retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes at almost ribosome-free membranes, the cross-linking between both proteins was increased, suggesting that their interaction is induced when translocation is initiated by ribosome binding.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	290	 The cross-linking between Sec61 and Sec61 was also dependent on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Both effects required the dissociation of the ribosome, and not merely the release of the nascent chain from the ribosome, since they occurred with puromycin at high but not at low salt concentrations.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The changes in cross-linking pattern upon ribosome removal or retargeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes could be caused by conformational alterations in an assembled complex or by dissociation of an assembly into subcomplexes.
0.43853024.9585408.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In any case, they provide first evidence for structural changes among known components of the translocation apparatus induced by the onset of cotranslational translocation.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	2	THE STUDY by van Heeckeren and colleagues, one of the current articles in focus (Ref.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	3	 L717 in this issue), addresses the question of whether adenoviral delivery of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to the cystic fibrosis airways attenuates inflammation and mortality associated with a chronic bacterial infection.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	4	 This is an intriguing question because adenoviral vectors themselves can invoke a substantial immune response that prohibits their repeated administration to the lung (2).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In their article, van Heeckeren and coworkers report that, within the infected cystic fibrosis lung, CFTR expression and/or adenoviral vector-induced inflammation yields a significant survival advantage.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This promising observation may have profound implications for the utility of adenoviral vectors in the gene therapy treatment of cystic fibrosis.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	7	CFTR mutations and cystic fibrosis lung pathophysiology.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, with a frequency of 1 in 2,500 live births.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is caused by defective function of the cftr gene product (14), which encodes a 170- to 180-kDa protein that functions as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The CFTR protein is expressed normally in those tissues affected in cystic fibrosis, including airway submucosal glands and airway epithelial cells.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The cystic fibrosis respiratory disease phenotype includes thick mucus secretion and bacterial colonization of the lung with a select few bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	12	 aeruginosa infections compounded by an inability to clear this organism result in a profound neutrophil migration into the airways and secretion of a variety of inflammatory mediators, including neutrophil elastase, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory cytokines, which cause irreversible damage to the airways and gas-exchange components.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	13	Cystic fibrosis and adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Correction of the defective cftr gene in vivo has long been the holy grail of the cystic fibrosis research community.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The use of adenoviral vectors in this pursuit has been problematic (reviewed in Ref.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In early clinical trials, the administration of adenoviral vectors encoding CFTR demonstrated great promise, with transient correction of chloride transport defects.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Subsequent studies, however, failed to repeat this initial finding and, moreover, revealed that adenoviral vector-mediated delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis airways was limited by the local immune response associated with multiple vector administrations.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Similarly, van Heeckeren and colleagues (19) reported previously that P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	19	 aeruginosa-induced bronchopulmonary inflammation also limited the efficacy of adenoviral vector-mediated gene transfer.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Despite this limitation, several studies suggest that the extent of CFTR correction required for a normal lung phenotype may be quite low (2), thereby validating the use of adenoviral vectors in cystic fibrosis gene therapy.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	21	Until the current study by van Heeckeren et al.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	22	 (20), the impact of adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy had not been examined in the context of a cystic fibrosis lung chronically infected with bacteria (19).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In this ambitious study by van Heeckeren and coworkers (20), the authors determined whether CFTR delivery improved the outcome of a cystic fibrosis murine model infected with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Specifically, the authors reported that gut-corrected cystic fibrosis mice treated with an adenoviral vector encoding CFTR and inoculated with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	25	 aeruginosa-laden agarose beads exhibited a significantly greater cumulative 10-day survival compared with sucrose controls; survival of empty vector controls, however, was not significantly different.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Importantly, these authors observed that there were no differences between mice receiving the CFTR vector or controls with regard to the extent of lung inflammation.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	27	 From these data, the authors concluded that the observed survival advantage in mice receiving adenoviral delivery of CFTR to the cystic fibrosis lung may be due to CFTR expression and/or proinflammatory effects of the adenoviral vector.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	28	 adenoviral vector-induced inflammation.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because cumulative 10-day survival was not significantly different between mice receiving CFTR-encoding vectors vs.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	30	 empty vector controls, it is likely that CFTR expression plays a small role in this response.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	31	 As the authors note (20), it is possible that the administration of an adenoviral vector may have induced a protective immune response that improved cumulative survival.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In support of this possibility, the authors observed a persistent lung lymphocytosis in response to adenoviral vector administration; this response was further enhanced upon challenge with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	33	 aeruginosa-laden agarose beads.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Interestingly, the authors did not observe increased bacterial killing in mice treated with either the CFTR-encoding adenoviral vector or the empty vector control.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	35	Early studies by Markham and coworkers (8, 12) suggest that T cell-mediated immune responses are protective against P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	36	 For example, these authors have shown that adoptive transfer of T cells from mice immunized with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	37	 aeruginosa to granulocytopenic mice resulted in nearly 100% survival upon challenge with P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Similar findings have been reported by others (3).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Despite these reports, the exact nature of T cell-mediated immunity in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	40	 aeruginosa infections remains unclear.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Hoiby and colleagues have reported that, in a rat model of P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	42	 aeruginosa pnuemonia (4) and in cystic fibrosis patients (11), chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	43	 aeruginosa infection induces a T helper type 2 (Th2)-like response.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Th2 responses are characterized by the production of IL-4 and IL-5 and are important in the generation of humoral immunity.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are further supported by their observation that chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	46	 aeruginosa lung infection is more severe in a Th2 responding mouse strain (BALB/c) (10).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	47	 With regard to protective T cell immunity, Hoiby and coworkers (4, 5, 9) have demonstrated that induction of a Th1-dominated cytokine response improves the outcome of chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Th1 responses are characterized by the production of IFN- and are instrumental in the generation of cell-mediated immunity.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Interestingly, previous studies have shown that adenoviral vector administration can trigger a Th1 response in the lungs of mice (18, 21) and humans (1).
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In light of these findings, it is tempting to conclude that the improved cumulative survival observed in the van Heeckeren study (20) is a function of an adenovirus-induced Th1 response; however, this conclusion may be too simplistic.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	51	Several recent studies call into question the beneficial nature of a Th1 response in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Reports examining the role of the virulence factor alginate (17) and the quorum-sensing molecule N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone (16) in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	53	 aeruginosa pathogenicity indicate that each of these factors induces a Th1-predominated immune response that may contribute to P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Moreover, Schultz and colleagues (15) have reported recently that, in a rat model of P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	55	 aeruginosa pneumonia, endogenous IFN- impairs bacterial clearance and host defense.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Clearly, differences in the strain of P.

0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	58	 chronic), route of administration, and model system of analysis must be taken into account when considering the role of Th1/Th2 responses in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	59	Despite the ongoing debate of T cell responses in P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	60	 aeruginosa infections, it should be noted that these studies were performed in non-cystic fibrosis model systems.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Because recent evidence indicates that T cell responses may be dysregulated in cystic fibrosis (6, 7), such studies need to be performed in the context of the cystic fibrosis lung.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This is underscored by the van Heeckeren study (20), which suggests that adenoviral vector-induced inflammation may promote survival of cystic fibrosis mice during a chronic P.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	63	 As with all well-conceived studies, this study precipitates a number of unanswered questions.
0.563135.15003935.html.plaintext.txt	64	 For example, in the absence of P.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	4	Polymorphonuclear leukocyte-dominated airway inflammation is a major component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and may be associated with CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction as well as infection.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Mutant F508 CFTR is mistrafficked, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and may cause "cell stress" and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	6	 G551D mutants also lack Cl channel function, but CFTR is trafficked normally.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We compared the effects of CFTR mutations on the endogenous activation of an NF-B reporter construct.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the mistrafficked F508 allele caused a sevenfold activation of NF-B compared with wild-type CFTR or the G551D mutant (P  <  0.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	9	 NF-B was also activated in 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells and in 16HBE/pcftr antisense cell lines, which lack CFTR Cl channel function but do not accumulate mutant protein in the ER.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This endogenous activation of NF-B was associated with elevated interleukin-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Impaired CFTR Cl channel activity as well as cell stress due to accumulation of mistrafficked CFTR in the ER contributes to the endogenous activation of NF-B in cells with the CFTR mutation.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	14	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations have many effects on the physiology of respiratory epithelial cells in addition to the expected effects on Cl transport.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	15	 One of the major clinical manifestations of CFTR mutations is excessive airway inflammation (14-17), implying that CFTR affects the immune function of airway epithelial cells, particularly the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-B-dependent proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that CFTR dysfunction influences the exogenous activation of epithelial immune function (8, 30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Bacteria persist in the respiratory tract of CF patients due to decreased antimicrobial activity in CF airway surface fluid and impair bacterial clearance due to mucus plugging (25).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Cells with CFTR mutations have increased numbers of asialoglycolipid receptors for common bacterial pathogens (24).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Ligation of these receptors activates NF-B-dependent epithelial interleukin (IL)-8 production to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the circulation into the airways (8).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Epithelial expression of IL-8 after bacterial stimulation is increased in cells with CFTR dysfunction, a finding demonstrated in both matched CF and corrected cell lines (5, 9, 27, 30) and in cftr-deficient [cftr(/)] mice compared with normal control mice (29).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	21	 How CFTR dysfunction might affect the endogenous expression of NF-B-dependent genes is less well documented.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	22	NF-B is a transcription factor required for the expression of many genes important in inflammation.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It is complexed in the cell cytoplasm with IB- and -, which are selectively phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded in the proteasome in response to stimuli (2).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is both signal-dependent and signal-independent IB- phosphorylation (20), a distinction that may be relevant to the endogenous activity of NF-B as opposed to the activation in response to a superficial stimulus such as bacterial attachment to surface receptors.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Ligation of superficial asialo-GM1 receptors on epithelial surfaces by bacterial adhesins stimulates Ca2+-dependent kinase activity through mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and NF-B activation (23a).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	26	 NF-B translocation may be regulated by other intracellular factors that lead to a different pattern of IB- phosphorylation than that elicited by extracellular stimuli (4).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It has been proposed that the abnormal trafficking of F508 CFTR and its accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides sufficient intracellular stress to cause NF-B activation (2).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	28	The most common CFTR mutation responsible for CF in ~70% of patients is the deletion of a phenylalanine residue (F508) in the nucleotide binding domain.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The F508 mutant CFTR not only fails to transport Cl in response to cAMP but accumulates in the ER due to abnormal maturation and folding (1, 7, 32).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	30	 From experimental data generated with adenovirus mutants targeted for retention in the ER, Pahl and colleagues (18, 19) proposed that homozygous F508 mutations in CFTR would similarly cause Ca2+ release, activation of NF-B, and resultant transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Comparison of the endogenous activation of NF-B in IB3 cells (W1282X/F508), a trafficking mutant similar to the homozygous F508 mutation, with that in corrected C-38 cells, which express a functional but truncated form of CFTR, was consistent with this hypothesis.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The transcriptionally active p65 component of NF-B was found in the nuclei of unstimulated CF cells but not of the corrected cells by immunofluorescence labeling and was confirmed by gel shift assays (8).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Manipulations to increase CFTR trafficking to the apical surface of the cell, such as growth at low temperature or the addition of glycerol, decreased the amount of p65 found in the IB3 cell nuclei.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Although these observations were consistent with the hypothesis that abnormal CFTR proteins cause endogenous activation of NF-B, they did not differentiate between two possible mechanisms: that "cell stress" associated with CFTR mistrafficking leads to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and stimulation of NF-B translocation or that CFTR Cl channel dysfunction by itself is associated with endogenous activation of NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	35	Other types of CFTR mutations cause "CF-like" physiology, i.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	36	, lack of Cl secretion in response to cAMP, without causing trafficking abnormalities or resulting in the accumulation of mutant proteins in the ER (7).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Analysis of the activation of NF-B in such cell lines would provide the opportunity to determine whether Cl channel dysfunction alone is associated with the regulation of NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The G551D CFTR mutant, in which a conserved glycine in the ATP binding cassette is mutated, lacks Cl channel function, but the protein is properly folded and trafficked (12).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Patients with the G551D mutation have a clinical disease that is indistinguishable from that caused by the more common F508 mutation (10).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The 9/HTEo human tracheal epithelial cell line transfected with a plasmid directing constitutive expression of the CFTR regulatory (R) domain also fails to transport Cl in response to cAMP while expressing low levels of wild-type CFTR message detected by RT-PCR (21).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	41	 These 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells are readily activated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and express significantly more IL-8 than control cells containing the empty vector (5).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The impact of impaired CFTR Cl channel activity on the normal interaction of IBs and NF-B is not known.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Recently constructed 16HBE cell lines expressing plasmid-encoded cftr in the sense or antisense orientation also provide the opportunity to test the impact of CFTR Cl channel function on the activation of NF-B in airway cells without the confounding issues of mistrafficked CFTR protein (23).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	44	In the experiments detailed in this report, several matched cell lines with CFTR dysfunction due to lack of Cl channel function, CFTR misfolding, mistrafficking, or both were tested for endogenous activation of NF-B and basal IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Although CFTR mistrafficking typical of the common F508 mutation and associated cell stress may be responsible for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with CF cells, we sought to establish whether CFTR Cl channel function as well as the effects of CFTR mistrafficking contributes to endogenous activation of NF-B and the excessive inflammation that characterizes CF airway pathology.

0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Clinical studies have clearly established a direct correlation between infection, IL-8 secretion, and the accumulation of PMNs and their toxic products in the CF lung (14-17).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Bacterial stimulation of cells with CFTR mutations activates significantly greater cytokine expression than matched cells with normal CFTR function (5, 8, 29, 30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Several reports (8, 28) suggest that cells with CFTR dysfunction have endogenously upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Young infants with CF, even without detectable evidence of prior infection, have PMNs and increased amounts of IL-8 in their airways (14), and proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in cells cultured directly from uninfected CF tissues (28).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	167	 These findings are consistent with the in vitro studies demonstrating endogenous activation of NF-B in CF but not in corrected cell lines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	168	 As indicated by the data in this report, lack of CFTR Cl channel function and the physiological consequences of mistrafficked mutant CFTR both appear to contribute to the endogenous activation of NF-B in CF airway cells, which is manifested by the increased expression of IL-8 in these cells, even in the absence of bacterial stimulation.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	169	There is evidence of endogenous activation of NF-B in cells with CFTR dysfunction due to several different mechanisms.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	170	 In previous studies, IB3 cells, which express the W1282X/F508 mutation associated with mistrafficked CFTR that accumulates in the ER, were found to have significant amounts of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei under basal conditions in which there was no nuclear NF-B in the corrected C-38 cells (8).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Because the translocation of NF-B can be associated with many types of stimuli, additional consequences of accumulated mutant CFTR in the ER were also demonstrated in the mutant cell line.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The IB3 cells were found to have higher basal [Ca2+]i, a predicted consequence of "ER stress" (2, 18).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The presence of nuclear NF-B in the IB3 cells could be correlated with increased IL-8 expression as estimated by RT-PCR compared with that in the control C-38 cell line.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The concentration of IL-8 in the tissue culture supernatant was minimal in these cells after an 18-h incubation in serum-free medium; however, the relative amount of IL-8 message was consistent with a previous report by DiMango et al.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Not all investigators have found increased endogenous levels of IL-8 associated with CFTR mutations (30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Cell culture conditions, effects of FCS, and handling of the monolayers all can affect the translocation of NF-B and endogenous expression of IL-8.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Thus it seems relevant to demonstrate that the presence of nuclear p65 appears to be associated with the expected biological response, namely IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	178	The activation of other NF-B-dependent pathways is not necessarily increased in IB3 compared with C-38 cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Stimulation of NF-B translocation is associated with an antiapoptotic effect in many cell lines including respiratory epithelial cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Rates of apoptosis can be increased by proteasome inhibitors that inhibit IB degradation and block NF-B translocation (31).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In a study published recently (23), the rates of IB3 and C-38 cell apoptosis were equivalent both under control conditions and after bacterial stimulation despite the observed differences in endogenous nuclear NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Thus the association between CFTR dysfunction, activation of NF-B, and transcription of NF-B-dependent genes is somewhat selective and is not a global response.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	183	The consequences of CFTR mistrafficking and the activation of NF-B were further demonstrated in CHO cells that do not normally express CFTR.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The presence of the mistrafficked mutant F508 CFTR was a significant stimulus for NF-B activation in CHO cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The G551D CFTR, which does not function appropriately as a Cl channel but is trafficked normally to the apical surface of the respiratory epithelial cell (10), did not stimulate NF-B.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Expression of normal CFTR from the same plasmid construct did not cause NF-B activation in CHO cells nor did transfection with the empty vector or the luciferase reporter construct.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Although both the G551D and F508 CFTR mutations are associated with clinical disease and lack of Cl secretion in response to cAMP (10), the major difference between these mutants is the mistrafficking and accumulation of F508 CFTR within the ER.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Thus it appears that the consequences of mistrafficking of F508 are sufficient to activate NF-B in CHO cells.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	189	In epithelial cells, unlike CHO cells, there appears to be a requirement for normal CFTR function in regulating NF-B-dependent gene transcription.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The homozygous F508 or the compound F508/W1282X mutation could activate NF-B by two independent mechanisms: cell stress associated with mistrafficking or effects directly due to lack of CFTR Cl channel activity.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Cell lines that lack CFTR Cl function due to either the overproduction of the CFTR R-domain or the expression of CFTR antisense had activated NF-B and significant amounts of endogenous IL-8 production compared with the corresponding control cell lines.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The amount of IL-8 endogenously expressed by these cell lines was greater than that of the IB3 or C38 cells and could be quantified by a standard ELISA assay.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The presence of the p65 component of NF-B in nuclei of undisturbed cells grown on coverslips as well as the relative activation of an NF-B reporter construct compared with appropriate controls indicates that their activated state is unlikely to be an artifact of either cell transformation or manipulations occurring during cell culture.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Because neither the 9/HTEo/pCep-R or the 16HBE/cftr antisense cells have excessive CFTR accumulation in the ER, the lack of CFTR Cl channel function in these epithelial cells appears to be responsible for the observed increase in NF-B activation and IL-8 expression.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	195	Exactly how CFTR dysfunction contributes to the activation and nuclear localization of NF-B is unclear.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	196	 There are multiple mechanisms for NF-B activation that can be divided into signal-dependent and signal-independent pathways (20).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	197	 In airway epithelial cells, bacterial attachment to asialo-GM1 activates a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that results in NF-B activation and IL-8 transcription through a cascade that includes phosphorylation of both the p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (23a).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	198	 A signal-independent pathway, perhaps involving IB or NF-B regulation directly, may be affected by mistrafficked CFTR.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	199	 IB- has been shown to be increased in IB3 cells under basal conditions and is hypophosphorylated, enabling nuclear NF-B with bound IB- complexes to direct transcription (30).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Hypophosphorylated IB- may be involved in either signal-dependent or the persistent activation of NF-B (26).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Diminished levels of cytosolic IB- was associated with CF (F508/F508) bronchial gland cells in primary culture and correlated with the presence of nuclear NF-B Rel A (27).
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	202	 It is possible that CFTR function, perhaps by affecting pH in specific intracellular compartments (3), affects relevant kinase or phosphatase activity.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Abnormalities in signal transducer and activator of transduction-1 phosphorylation in the same 9/HTEo/pCep-R cells have been described recently (13), indicating that CFTR may have a role in multiple signaling pathways.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	204	 These observations reflect the complexities of CFTR involvement in the normal physiology of the epithelial cell.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Strategies such as gene therapy to correct CFTR Cl channel function alone, which do not ameliorate the effects of mutant CFTR mistrafficking in the majority of airway epithelial cells, may not be sufficient to control the inflammatory component of CF lung disease.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	206	These consequences of CFTR dysfunction in activating translocation of NF-B and stimulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines are important in not only understanding the many roles of CFTR in normal cell physiology but are also clinically relevant.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The majority of CF patients with the most common F508 CFTR alleles have multiple reasons for increased expression of inflammatory mediators in their airways.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The effects of CFTR mistrafficking and ER stress, lack of CFTR Cl channel function, and exogenous stimulation due to airway infection all act to increase epithelial NF-B translocation and the expression of proinflammatory genes.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This epithelial immune activation does provide multiple targets for therapy.
0.49234396.11404248.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It may be possible to devise a therapy to modulate the endogenous upregulation of NF-B-dependent gene transcription without compromising the epithelial barrier function or the host inflammatory response to exogenous airway pathogens.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	3	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an epithelial cell Cl channel, whose gating activity and membrane trafficking are controlled by cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nature 390: 302-305, 1997), a protein best known for its role in membrane trafficking and neurosecretion.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To examine the mechanism of syntaxin 1A inhibition, we expressed these proteins in Xenopus oocytes and monitored agonist-induced changes in plasma membrane capacitance and cell surface fluorescence of CFTR that contains an external epitope tag.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	7	 cAMP stimulation elicited large increases in membrane capacitance and in cell surface labeling of flag-tagged CFTR.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Coexpression of CFTR with syntaxin 1A, but not syntaxin 3, inhibited cAMP-induced increases in membrane capacitance and plasma membrane CFTR content.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Injection of botulinum toxin/C1 rapidly reversed syntaxin's effects on current and capacitance, indicating that they cannot be explained by an effect on CFTR synthesis.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These findings indicate that acute regulation of the number of CFTR Cl channels in plasma membrane is one mechanism by which cAMP/PKA regulates Cl currents.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	15	CYSTIC FIBROSIS IS CAUSED by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which accounts for the cAMP-stimulated Cl conductance at the apical membranes of many secretory and absorptive epithelial cells (22).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that CFTR Cl channel activity requires protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its R-domain (18, 31) and binding and hydrolysis of ATP at one or both nucleotide binding domains (1, 23, 26).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition to facilitating CFTR Cl channel gating, cAMP/PKA stimulation of CFTR-expressing cells evokes changes in membrane trafficking.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	18	 cAMP stimulates exocytosis and inhibits endocytosis, and these regulated trafficking events require the expression of wild-type CFTR (5).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The close correlation observed between CFTR-dependent increases in Cl current and membrane capacitance suggests that CFTR resides in the membrane vesicles whose trafficking is influenced by cAMP-dependent agonists (25, 30).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Accordingly, Cl current stimulation by cAMP/PKA may arise from increases in channel open probability (Po) and/or from increases in the number (N) of active CFTR Cl channels residing in the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	21	Results of recent studies have implicated a role for membrane traffic regulatory proteins in the control of CFTR Cl currents.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Coexpression of syntaxin 1A with CFTR in Xenopus oocytes inhibited cAMP-stimulated Cl currents, and this inhibition could be reversed by the syntaxin binding protein, munc-18.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	24	 They proposed that syntaxin 1A and munc-18 regulate CFTR, and thus Cl secretion, at the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	25	Using measurements of plasma membrane capacitance and cell surface expression of CFTR, we demonstrate here that syntaxin 1A expression interferes with cAMP/PKA-regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We used epitope-tagged CFTR to show that cAMP stimulation elicits an increase in plasma membrane CFTR content, which is paralleled by a cAMP-induced increase in plasma membrane capacitance.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Syntaxin 1A coexpression selectively inhibited the cAMP-induced increase in membrane capacitance and reduced the amount of CFTR detected in the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This syntaxin-induced reduction in N is consistent with the role of this protein as a component of the membrane fusion machinery.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The decay time constant was derived from a single exponential fit of the pulse currents, and Cm was calculated on-line as described (30).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Steady-state membrane currents were recorded at 60 mV; these inward currents reflect Cl flow through CFTR during stimulation by cAMP, as shown in prior studies (8, 11).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Values of ICl and Cm were obtained at 2-s intervals; steady-state values are given in the figures.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We used immunofluorescence techniques to monitor the expression of CFTR in the oocyte plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Cells were injected with cRNA encoding an epitope-tagged CFTR, which contains the flag epitope (DYKDDDK) inserted into the predicted fourth extracellular loop of CFTR, after amino acid position 901, and designated M2-901/CFTR.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Prior studies have shown that this flag-tagged CFTR behaves identically to its wild-type counterpart during macroscopic current stimulation (13), and single channel measurements detect no difference in channel gating or PKA/ATP regulation relative to wild-type CFTR (24).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	48	M2-901/CFTR-expressing oocytes were subjected to a staining protocol to quantitate CFTR protein expression at the cell surface using the monoclonal M2 antibody (Kodak).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Oocytes were cooled rapidly to 0-4 degrees C and incubated with M2 antibody overnight at this temperature (1:1,250 dilution).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	50	 After they were washed with 5% FCS-ND-96, oocytes were incubated at 4 degrees C in fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) and then washed five times as above.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This protocol avoids permeabilization or fixation conditions that might expose intracellular flag-CFTR to the M2 antibody.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Thus the staining conditions and epitope position were selected to permit detection of M2-901/CFTR only when it is localized in the plasma membrane and the epitope is exposed at the cell surface.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	53	 For some experiments, CFTR Cl currents were recorded from M2-901/CFTR-expressing oocytes before implementing the staining protocol.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This permitted CFTR Cl currents and cell surface expression to be determined in the same cells.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Oocytes expressing M2-901/CFTR under nonstimulated conditions showed low levels of surface staining that were slightly above background, suggesting a low level of CFTR expression in the plasma membrane in the absence of agonist stimulation (Fig.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The low fluorescence intensity detected in the absence of agonist suggests that the staining protocol does not permit access of the M2 antibody to intracellular epitope.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	92	Average data from three experiments in nonpermeabilized oocytes are provided in Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Also shown are the results from parallel measurements of steady-state current obtained before and after addition of forskolin/IBMX; these values are consistent with the magnitude of CFTR current stimulation observed in prior studies (8, 11).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The immunofluorescence data indicate that the increase in Cl current is paralleled by an increase in plasma membrane CFTR.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	95	 For oocytes in the stimulation group, the staining protocol was initiated 15 min after addition of forskolin/IBMX, the time when Cl currents rise to their plateau level.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Thus detection of the M2 epitope at the cell surface occurs within the time frame required for the cAMP-induced increases in Cl current and membrane capacitance (30).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	97	 These findings are consistent with the idea that cAMP/PKA stimulation induces the insertion of CFTR-containing vesicles into the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	98	Syntaxin 1A inhibits cAMP/PKA-induced increases in plasma membrane capacitance and CFTR.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The effects on ICl and Cm of syntaxin coexpression with CFTR are illustrated in Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	100	 When syntaxin 1A was coexpressed with CFTR, Cl current stimulation by cAMP was inhibited, as reported by Naren et al.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	101	 In parallel with the syntaxin-induced reduction in Cl current, cAMP stimulation of membrane capacitance is also markedly inhibited.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The inhibition of changes in both ICl (ICl) and Cm (Cm) is selective for syntaxin 1A.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Coexpression of syntaxin 3 with CFTR did not affect these parameters significantly, suggesting that these effects are syntaxin isoform specific.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This finding also eliminates translational competition between the CFTR and syntaxin cRNAs as an explanation of the inhibitory effect of syntaxin 1A on the agonist-induced ICl and Cm.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	110	The effect of syntaxin 1A coexpression on CFTR detected at the oocyte surface during cAMP/PKA stimulation is illustrated in Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	111	 1C, these images were collected from oocytes stimulated with maximally effective concentrations of forskolin and IBMX (see legend to Fig.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	113	 This low fluorescence intensity indicates that cAMP stimulation does not increase background fluorescence in the absence of CFTR expression (compare with Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	114	 During cAMP stimulation, M2-901/CFTR was readily detected in the surface membrane (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	115	 3B), but coexpression with syntaxin 1A markedly reduced plasma membrane CFTR during cAMP stimulation (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This result is consistent with the syntaxin 1A-induced decrease in cAMP-dependent Cm, shown in Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	117	 As with the membrane capacitance and current responses, syntaxin 3 coexpression had no effect on cell surface CFTR staining (data not shown).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Quantitation of the results from four experiments (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	119	 3D) shows that CFTR surface expression correlates with the magnitude of currents recorded from the same oocytes before antibody labeling.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	120	 With syntaxin 1A coexpression, cell surface CFTR fluorescence intensity fell nearly to the level of the water-injected controls.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Thus insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane is required for activation of the CFTR Cl currents recorded from these cells during stimulation, and syntaxin 1A reduces CFTR Cl currents by decreasing the amount of CFTR in the plasma membrane during stimulation.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	131	 We injected BoT/C1 60 min before recording the current and capacitance responses to forskolin/IBMX.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	132	 BoT/C1 acutely reversed the syntaxin 1A inhibition of ICl and Cm, presumably due to cleavage of syntaxin 1A.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The toxin did not interfere with the ICl or Cm responses in oocytes injected with CFTR alone.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This relatively rapid reversal of CFTR function argues against an effect of syntaxin on the level of CFTR protein expression as an explanation for the inhibitory effect on CFTR current or capacitance.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	135	 For comparison, the half time for inhibition of CFTR currents in oocytes by brefeldin A is ~6 h (data not shown).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This finding indicates that the steady-state rates of CFTR production and degradation in these cells are not sufficiently rapid for protein synthesis to account for the BoT/C1 reversal of syntaxin's effects on CFTR.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	142	 These control experiments were performed to examine the possibility that syntaxin 1A may block the functional expression of CFTR by generally interfering with the migration of proteins through the biosynthetic pathway leading to the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	143	 cRNA amounts were selected based on prior reports using these constructs (see references below), and the currents obtained are similar in magnitude.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Coexpression of syntaxin 1A with the Na-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1 (12), the ATP-sensitive Ca-activated K channel IK1 (14), or the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (17) had no effect on the currents associated with activation of these proteins (Fig.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In addition, syntaxin 1A did not inhibit plasma membrane expression of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein at the oocyte surface, which was detected by immunofluorescence using techniques similar to those used for detection of cell surface M2-901/CFTR [background-subtracted HA fluorescence intensities: HA alone, 24.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	149	 These data show that syntaxin 1A does not impair HA protein expression, even when the cRNA dose ratio is in favor of syntaxin 1A.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In addition, relative protein expression level for hIK1 can be judged from the current, which is comparable with that obtained from CFTR (compare Figs.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Because the single-channel current amplitude and Po of hIK1 are greater than those of CFTR (12), a similar macroscopic current requires the expression of less protein.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Despite this, hIK1 currents were not inhibited by syntaxin 1A, even at five times the dose required for maximal inhibition of CFTR (see legends to Figs.

0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	164	In a previous study (30), we showed that cAMP stimulation increased both Cl current and membrane capacitance in CFTR-expressing Xenopus oocytes.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These effects were reversible with agonist washout and required CFTR expression.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Changes in ICl and Cm were closely correlated with one another as the agonist dose or CFTR expression level were varied, or when CFTR mutants with different ICl responses were expressed.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The increase in cell surface area detected by Cm was confirmed by morphometry of the oocyte surface in the same cells used for electrical recordings (30).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This close correlation between ICl and Cm suggests that CFTR activation by cAMP/PKA elicits reversible stimulation of membrane vesicle insertion into the plasma membrane, a process that is implicated in a variety of CFTR-expressing cells (4).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	169	The results obtained from oocytes expressing an epitope-tagged CFTR verify this concept.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Incorporation of an extracellular flag epitope permits detection of CFTR protein at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells (13).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This approach obviates problems of resolving protein localization in the plasma membrane, since standard immunofluorescence techniques do not have sufficient resolution to distinguish protein in 100-nm submembrane vesicles from that in the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	172	 CFTR bearing a flag tag in its fourth extracellular loop was not detected appreciably at the surface of oocytes under basal, nonstimulated conditions, when CFTR Cl currents are near zero (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	173	 cAMP stimulation increased plasma membrane CFTR sevenfold within the time frame associated with stimulation of ICl and Cm (~15 min, Figs.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Control experiments indicated that M2 antibody staining of noninjected oocytes was not affected by cAMP stimulation, i.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	175	, the surface labeling signal is CFTR and stimulation dependent.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The correlations between cAMP-stimulated CFTR current, capacitance, and cell surface labeling show that CFTR insertion by exocytosis is an important event in the stimulation of plasma membrane Cl conductance of these cells by cAMP.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	177	The oocyte has proven to be a useful model for studies of other transporter-related membrane-trafficking events.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Previous studies include relocation of -aminobutyric acid transporters to the plasma membrane in response to protein kinase C activation (7) and regulation of the cell surface expression of several Na-dependent cotransport processes by protein kinases A and C (12).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In addition, the influence of mutations in the amiloride-sensitive Na channel (ENaC), which produce hypertension by prolonging the plasma membrane residency time of ENaC, was characterized mechanistically using the oocyte expression system (28).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	180	The biochemical events that control membrane insertion and retrieval processes at the plasma membrane are thought to conform to principles first identified for vesicle transit among compartments of the protein biosynthetic pathway (2, 29).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Interactions among proteins that comprise the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein target receptor (SNARE) protein complex control the targeting, docking, fusion, and retrieval of membrane vesicles that contain secretory products or integral membrane proteins, like CFTR, that will become constituents of the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The physiological importance of SNARE proteins is exemplified in the highly regulated process of neurosecretion; our understanding of the actions of these proteins in membrane-trafficking events in epithelial cells is relatively meager.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	183	Our findings implicate a role for syntaxin in regulated CFTR trafficking.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Coexpression of CFTR with syntaxin 1A reduced the cAMP-dependent membrane insertion event that is detected as an increase in membrane capacitance (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Syntaxin also blocked the increase in plasma membrane CFTR that occurs during stimulation of its activity by cAMP/PKA (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	186	 CFTR was not detected at significant levels in the plasma membrane under basal conditions (Fig.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	187	 1), and it was not present appreciably at the cell surface during cAMP stimulation in cells coexpressing syntaxin 1A.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These effects were specific for CFTR, as opposed to other integral membrane proteins examined, they were selective for this syntaxin isoform, and they could not be explained by an effect of syntaxin on CFTR synthesis.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Taken together, these findings indicate that syntaxin 1A interferes with cAMP/PKA-stimulated trafficking of CFTR to the cell surface.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	190	What is the mechanism of this effect? The results of Naren et al.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	191	 (20, 21) suggest that CFTR Cl currents are inhibited due to a physical interaction between these proteins.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	192	 A protein-protein interaction has been observed also between N-type Ca channels and syntaxin 1A (27), which may contribute to syntaxin-associated downregulation of Ca currents (3, 32).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Assuming that a physical interaction occurs between syntaxin 1A and CFTR in vivo, expressed syntaxin 1A may prevent CFTR insertion into the plasma membrane by binding with CFTR contained in vesicles that would normally fuse with the plasma membrane.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Second, a CFTR-syntaxin 1A complex may be retrieved rapidly from the plasma membrane by endocytosis.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Our measurements detect net membrane area (Cm) or steady-state plasma membrane CFTR and do not distinguish whether the effect of syntaxin is on insertion or retrieval of CFTR.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	196	It is possible also that overexpressed syntaxin associates primarily not with CFTR but with other SNARE components to block the membrane fusion process.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	197	 According to this view, syntaxin 1A overexpression would disrupt the stoichiometric interactions among SNARE proteins that are required for the plasma membrane fusion of CFTR-containing vesicles.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This effect of expressed syntaxin has been observed previously.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	199	 For example, exogenous expression of the Golgi t-SNARE, syntaxin 5, inhibited protein traffic from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, the step in which this syntaxin isoform functions (9).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Likewise, expression of syntaxin 1A, but not 1B, blocked glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic  cells (19).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In MDCK cells, syntaxin 3 is apically localized, and its exogenous expression selectively inhibited apical targeting and apical recycling of the immunoglobulin receptor (16).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These findings suggest that overexpression of a specific syntaxin isoform disrupts the pathway in which that isoform normally plays a role in membrane-trafficking events.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	203	 If this is true, then our results suggest that endogenous SNARE proteins, including a Xenopus syntaxin 1A ortholog, are responsible for cAMP-regulated plasma membrane CFTR insertion in oocytes.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Expression of the core components of the SNARE machinery has been observed in the cortical granules of sea urchin oocytes (6).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Accordingly, the SNARE fusion machinery would be employed to mediate the membrane insertion of CFTR, and an interaction of CFTR with SNARE proteins could explain how the expression of CFTR alone can confer cAMP-dependent membrane-trafficking events on cells where none was present before CFTR expression (5, 30).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	206	The requirement for specific SNARE components in this process could also account for the apparent failure of certain cell types to support regulated CFTR-trafficking events (10, 15).
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The demonstration that syntaxin 1A is expressed in colonic secretory cells (1) is consistent with the concept that this protein, together with other components of the SNARE machinery, mediates the cAMP/PKA-regulated insertion of CFTR into the apical membranes of these cells.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Although our findings suggest that the SNARE machinery plays an important role in the regulated trafficking of CFTR at the plasma membrane, they do not rule out a direct regulation of CFTR's gating (Po) that could result from a physical interaction with syntaxin.
0.48486084.10409120.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Accordingly, syntaxin could directly regulate CFTR Cl currents, perhaps in relation to SNARE protein-mediated membrane-trafficking reactions that control the amount of CFTR present in the plasma membrane.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	3	Expression of a mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been shown to enhance proliferation within CF airways, and cells expressing a mutated CFTR have been shown to be less susceptible to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Because the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and all CF mouse models are characterized by gastrointestinal obstruction, we hypothesized that CFTR null mice would have increased epithelial cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis within the small intestine.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The rate of intestinal epithelial cell migration from crypt to villus was increased in CFTR null mice relative to mice expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This difference in migration could be explained by an increase in epithelial cell proliferation but not by a difference in apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, using two independent sets of CF cell lines, we found that epithelial cell susceptibility to apoptosis was unrelated to the presence of a functional CFTR.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In all mouse models of CF in which the CFTR has been deleted by insertional or deletional mutagenesis, intestinal pathophysiology is characterized by mucus accumulation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, goblet cell hyperplasia, and intestinal obstruction.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In addition, the CFTR is expressed in the epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract with a reduction in expression along the crypt-to-villus axis (7, 26).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	17	Previously, Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9) showed that cultured C127 mouse mammary epithelial cells stably transfected with the F508-mutated CFTR remained viable and were less susceptible to apoptosis induced by cycloheximide or etoposide than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a physiologically relevant process that occurs in regenerating tissues such as the lung and intestine.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Cell turnover is a balance between proliferation and elimination, and cell proliferation has been shown to be greater in airway epithelia and nasal polyps in CF patients than in tissue from non-CF patients (12, 15).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although this phenomenon has traditionally been attributed to inflammation, the possibility that the proliferative differences might be due to differential expression of the CFTR has not been addressed.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	21	Because all mouse models of CF (CFTR /) develop intestinal obstructions (10) and the CFTR is expressed in epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that the CFTR / mouse intestine would show evidence of altered apoptosis and/or enhanced proliferation relative to mice expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The hypothesis was tested in vivo using a knockout mouse model of CF.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Mice expressing a mutant CFTR were found to have a greater rate of migration of epithelial cells up the crypt-villus axis within the small intestine.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This increased rate could be attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of cells within the crypts of Lieberkuhn but not to differences in apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Because these current results contradict the previous findings (9) of differences in apoptosis between cells transfected with the F508 CFTR and the wild-type CFTR, studies were extended to further examine apoptosis in two independent cell culture models of CF.

0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	200	Many CF patients and all mouse models of CF have a common pathology in their susceptibility to gastrointestinal obstruction.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In the normal intestine, epithelial cells line the villi of the absorptive surfaces.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These cells are continuously regenerated by proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn, differentiation, and migration up the villi.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	203	 At the tips of the villi, the cells undergo apoptosis and are shed into the lumen (11, 24).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	204	 (18) have shown that both proliferation and apoptosis occur in the stem cells within the crypts and that apoptosis within the crypts is likely to be an important part of the homeostatic process for tissue maintenance.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Under normal conditions, stem cell proliferation and epithelial sloughing are in equilibrium.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	206	 As we have shown in the current study, epithelial cells in CFTR / mice migrate up the crypt-villus axis at a greater rate than in animals expressing a functional CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The epithelial cells from CFTR / mice migrated 27% farther in 48 h than those from the CFTR +/ mice.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	208	 This difference in rate is due to differences in proliferation and not apoptosis within the crypts of Lieberkuhn with ~12% more cells with proliferative capacity in the CFTR / mice than the CFTR +/ mice.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Because villus length is not different between the genotypes (data not shown), the increased number of cells proliferating within the crypt and migrating up the villi would lead to an increase in the mass of cells that are sloughed into the gastrointestinal tract.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	210	The increased proliferative capacity within the CFTR-null mice may be attributed to a cellular defect within the cells as a result of a nonfunctional CFTR, although the mechanism by which this might happen is unknown.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Potentially, differences in intracellular pH might account for the enhanced proliferation in CFTR / cells.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Cytosolic pH is thought to be one of the factors that control the rate of proliferation (8) with cytoplasmic alkalinization constituting a signal for mitogenesis (1, 22, 27).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In addition, cells with higher intracellular pH are more likely to be in the S, G2, or M phases of the cell cycle, whereas cells with lower pH are more likely to be in G1 (19).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Cells expressing a mutated CFTR have been reported (5, 6) to have an elevated cytosolic pH, and overexpression of the wild-type CFTR but not a mutant CFTR results in growth arrest (23).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Thus a mutation in the CFTR may result in an elevated intracellular pH, which stimulates the cell to undergo proliferation more readily and thus increase the rate at which epithelial cells of the crypts of Lieberkuhn proliferate and migrate up the intestinal villi.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	216	All the mouse models of CF show evidence of inflammation and intestinal obstructions (10); thus the possibility that the stimulus to enhanced proliferation within the intestine of the CFTR / mice might be due to differences in inflammation cannot be ruled out.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Proliferation in nasal polyps (12, 16) and epithelium of bronchial airways (15) has been shown to be increased in CF patients and has been attributed to airway inflammation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Chronic inflammation has been shown to be present in the CF intestine with increased luminal content of immune cell constituents, secretory immunoglobulins, and cytokines (25).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Therefore, inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract potentially can be a stimulus to enhanced proliferation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	220	Initial studies by Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9) showed decreased susceptibility to apoptosis in cells expressing the mutated CFTR relative to cells expressing the wild-type CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In this initial study, cycloheximide and etoposide were used to induce apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The CFTR is an anion channel that when mutated does not allow for chloride to be transported across the plasma membrane.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Because this is a transport problem, one concern with the use of any drug or chemical to induce apoptosis is a difference in the ability of the cells to transport the drug or chemical across the cell membrane.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	224	 To avoid this potential problem in the current studies, UV irradiation was utilized as the apoptotic stimulus.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Cells expressing the mutated CFTR were more resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR, which is in accordance with the findings of Gottlieb and Dosanjh (9).
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	226	 However, one control that was lacking from the original set of experiments was the introduction of the wild-type CFTR into these resistant cell lines to restore susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In the current study, infection of C127 F08 cells with an adenovirus expressing the wild-type CFTR failed to restore susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	228	 -galactosidase adenovirus-infected cells were found to be more susceptible to death than both the uninfected and infected CFTR cells.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The reason behind this increased propensity toward death is not known.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The -galactosidase construct used in these experiments was the nuclear-targeted protein, which, because of its location of expression, may make the cells more susceptible to the DNA-damaging effect of UV irradiation.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To confirm the findings from the C127 cells, an independent set of cell lines was used to determine whether expression of a mutated or wild-type CFTR results in differences in susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Cells with a mutated CFTR were found to be no different in their sensitivity to UV irradiation than cells expressing the wild-type CFTR when evaluated for membrane destabilization detected by the uptake of YOPRO-1, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, DNA degradation, or caspase cleavage.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Thus taken together the data suggest that the CFTR does not play a role in a cell's susceptibility to apoptosis.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	234	In the CFTR-null mice, epithelial cell kinetics within the gastrointestinal tract differ from mice expressing at least one copy of the functional CFTR.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The altered proliferation within the crypts of Lieberkuhn is not accompanied by changes in apoptosis but results in an increased rate of cell migration up the villus.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The increased number of cells reaching the intestinal lumen might contribute to the viscosity of the luminal contents and increase the likelihood of intestinal blockage, one of the pathophysiological hallmarks of CF.
0.4581272.11518680.html.plaintext.txt	237	 If epithelial cell proliferation and turnover is increased in parallel in the CF lung and pancreas, this might contribute to the viscosity of the bronchial and pancreatic secretions and exacerbate the symptoms of CF.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	4	Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects a number of epithelial tissues, including those in the gastrointestinal tract.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The goal of this review is to summarize data related to regulation of the protein product of the CF gene, CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), by a variety of small molecules.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	6	 There has been a surge of interest in discovering small molecules that could be exogenously added to cells and tissues to regulate CFTR and could potentially be used alone or in combination with genetic approaches for therapy in CF.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We will discuss the apparent mechanisms of action of genistein, milrinone, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, IBMX, and NS-004; several of which appear to interact directly with one or both nucleotide binding domains of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We also discuss how HCO3 interacts with CFTR as both a permeating anion and a potential regulator of Cl permeation through the CFTR ion channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	9	 It is likely that there are complicated interactions between Cl and HCO3 in the secretion of both ions through the CFTR and the anion exchanger in intestinal cells, and these may yield a role of CFTR in regulation of intestinal HCO3 secretion as well as of intra- and extracellular pH.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	12	CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease of the Caucasian population, with an incidence of 1 in 2,500 live births and a carrier frequency of ~1 in 25.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The disease is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (30), which functions as a cAMP-activated Cl channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	14	 At the cellular level, CFTR dysfunction results in defective cAMP-regulated Cl conductance, primarily in cells of epithelial origin (27).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Although lung disease is the primary cause of mortality in CF patients, a significant proportion of the morbidity can be directly attributed to gastrointestinal complications.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon express high levels of CFTR mRNA (30).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Immunocytochemical analysis also demonstrated high CFTR protein expression at the luminal surfaces along the intestine (7).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The small intestine of CF patients exhibits decreased Cl and fluid secretion that results in meconium ileus (lower water content and higher viscosity compared with non-CF patients) in ~10% of all CF newborns and accumulation of mucus and intestinal obstructions [primarily in ileocecum and large intestine in  > 20% of adult patients (see Ref.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Intestinal pathophysiology appears to be the hallmark of recently developed transgenic CF mouse models.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The ileocecum and large intestine appear to be the most common sites of intestinal blockade, whereas jejunal obstructions occur less frequently (13).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	21	Thus CFTR plays an important role in intestinal secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This secretion is controlled by multiple hormones and nerve cell transmitters, which will couple to the activation of CFTR as well as the other ion channels and transporters that are required to generate transepithelial secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Phosphorylation of CFTR by protein kinases (PK) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases (PP) is considered the major way by which CFTR Cl channel activity is physiologically regulated.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition, the normal gating cycle (both opening and closing) of CFTR requires ATP binding and hydrolysis at the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR (see Ref.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	25	 ATP concentration is likely maintained constant in cells and is therefore not a significant physiological regulator.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	26	In addition to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and ATP binding and hydrolysis, investigators have searched for exogenous compounds that are potential therapeutic activators of the mutant CFTR protein found in CF patients.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of several such small molecules that will be discussed in this review.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Some of these small molecules appear to bind directly to one or both of the NBDs of CFTR and, if CFTR has been prephosphorylated, increase the open probability of the channel.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the first portion of this review, PHARMACOLOGICAL REGULATION OF CFTR BY SMALL MOLECULES, we will discuss work showing that genistein, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), IBMX and other xanthines, and NS-004 all seem to operate this way.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In addition, we will discuss the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor milrinone, which also stimulates CFTR but through a mechanism that is less well characterized.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	34	In the second portion of this review, HCO3 PERMEATION AND POSSIBLE REGULATION OF CFTR-MEDIATED CL CURRENTS, we will discuss the question of HCO3 permeation and potential regulation of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This has been a controversial area of research.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Most secretory epithelia secrete both Cl and HCO3, and CFTR seems to be involved in a critical way that is still poorly understood.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We will discuss data relevant to the question of whether the key role of CFTR is to conduct HCO3 itself or to play some sort of permissive role in HCO3 secretion through an adjacent anion exchanger that requires Cl at the cell's luminal aspect to exchange for cellular HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Alternatively, CFTR could also be required to keep cellular Cl concentration low enough that Cl enters the cell on the exchanger and exchanges for cellular HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We will also discuss the possibility that HCO3 may regulate the activity of CFTR by altering the permeation of Cl due to the multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	40	    PHARMACOLOGICAL REGULATION OF CFTR BY SMALL MOLECULES.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Genistein is a member of the large class of naturally occurring flavonoids.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Some flavonoids are more potent than genistein in activating CFTR (19), but we will focus on genistein because it has been investigated the most thoroughly.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Genistein is a potent activator of CFTR (e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	44	 20, 22), but the activating mechanism has been debated.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Genistein did not seem to operate through activation of protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, or PKG, because there were no increases in intracellular cAMP, Ca2+, or cGMP concentrations (21, 32).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Genistein is a well-known tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, and two other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin 47 and tyrphostin B42) also stimulated CFTR, and genistein-stimulated channel activity was blocked by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (21, 32).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, several other PTK inhibitors (tyrphostin A23, tyrphostin A51, erbstatin analog, and herbimycin) failed to stimulate CFTR (20).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Genistein also stimulated CFTR equally well when GTP (a poor substrate for tyrosine kinases) was used as a replacement for ATP (10).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Some results suggested that genistein activated CFTR by blocking a PP: inactivation rates of CFTR currents on cAMP removal were markedly decreased by genistein (20), and CFTR was phosphorylated on the same amino acids by both genistein (which did not raise cAMP concentration) and forskolin (which did) (29).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	50	More recent data have indicated that the most likely explanation for the stimulatory effect of genistein was through direct binding to an NBD of phosphorylated CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Genistein did not directly open CFTR channels, because genistein did not stimulate CFTR in ATP- or cAMP-depleted monolayers (22).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Similarly, genistein activation of CFTR in excised patches required both ATP and prior phosphorylation by PKA (10).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In addition, genistein stimulated phosphatase-resistant, thiophosphorylated CFTR, even in the presence of PKI (to block PKA) or VO4 (to block PP) (10, 39).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Kinetic analysis indicated that a genistein concentration of  < 35  microM induced prolonged openings of CFTR (similar to the effect of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), whereas a genistein concentration of  > 35  microM caused prolonged closed times (38).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	55	An attractive model for stimulatory and inhibitory effects of genistein on CFTR is that of Gadsby et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This model (11) proposes that ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD1 control channel opening and closing at low phosphorylation levels, and once ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 has opened a highly phosphorylated CFTR channel, ATP binding to NBD2 can stabilize the open state.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Hydrolysis of the nucleotide at NBD2 terminates the stabilization.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Agents that interfere with ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 [e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	59	, 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) or pyrophosphate] induce prolonged burst opening.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Genistein is a competitive inhibitor with ATP for binding to PTK (inhibitor constant, 13.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	61	7  microM) and to other ATP-binding proteins, and crystal structure analysis of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck revealed that the structurally related flavone and CFTR activator quercetin (19) localized to the binding site for the adenine ring of AMP-PNP or ATP (34).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	62	 When considering the sequence homology shared by Walker A-type-binding motifs of PTK and NBDs of CFTR, it therefore seems possible that genistein competes for ATP-binding sites on CFTR, possibly at NBD2 (10), thereby slowing down ATP hydrolysis and preventing CFTR channel closure.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	63	 It is unlikely that genistein activates CFTR by binding to a Src kinase, because this would require activation of a tyrosine kinase and genistein blocks tyrosine kinases.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	64	 It might also be proposed that higher concentrations of genistein inhibit CFTR by competing with ATP at NBD1 (which may have a lower affinity for genistein binding) and prevent CFTR from opening.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The substituted benzimidazolone NS-004 has effects that are quite similar to those exhibited by genistein.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	66	1 to 1  microM) and F508-CFTR (at  > 10  microM) without raising cAMP concentration and also in the presence of a PKA inhibitor (12), but it was necessary to pretreat cells with forskolin before patch excision to observe CFTR channel activation by NS-004.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In addition, the drug caused active CFTR channels to increase their activity, but it had no effect when added after channel rundown, indicating that NS-004 required phosphorylated CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	68	 NS-004 did not inhibit in vitro PP activity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Thus, although NS-004 was thought to operate by directly opening CFTR (12), the drug may use a mechanism similar to that of genistein to increase open probabilities of phosphorylated, active channels without affecting either PK or PP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The cardiotonic drug milrinone is an inhibitor of cGMP-inhibited PDE (a class III PDE) and was selected from several drugs inhibiting PDE isozymes (23).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Because PDE inhibitors raise cellular cAMP concentration and CFTR is activated by increases in cAMP concentration, it has been assumed that milrinone (and also IBMX, see below) stimulate CFTR by raising cAMP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, the exact mechanisms have not been determined.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Milrinone activated both normal and F508-CFTR in transformed nasal epithelial cells (24), and a combination of forskolin and milrinone (but not milrinone alone) increased the potential difference across nasal epithelium of F508-CFTR mice in vivo but not in transgenic mice lacking CFTR (24).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Milrinone activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist, indicating that the drug likely had other effects than to stimulate production of cAMP.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	75	IBMX, DPCPX, and other xanthine derivatives.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	76	 IBMX is an inhibitor of PDE with broad specificity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Despite its broad use as a PDE inhibitor, it seems unlikely that IBMX works solely via this mechanism.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	78	 IBMX activated CFTR even when cells had been maximally stimulated with forskolin or some other cAMP agonist (23).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Although other substituted xanthine derivatives activated CFTR, there was no correlation between effects on CFTR and cellular cAMP and ATP concentrations (4).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We have also found, through use of a fluorescence assay for PKA activity (as opposed to measurements of cAMP concentration using RIA), that forskolin caused fibroblasts to raise cAMP concentration to such a high level that PKA activity was saturated (by maximally binding cAMP), and IBMX (which indeed raised cAMP concentration) had no further effect to increase PKA activity (B.

0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	82	 It therefore seems likely that the stimulatory effects of IBMX on CFTR are due to combined effects to raise cAMP (when PKA has not been saturated) and also to block PP or directly bind to CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	83	The xanthine derivative DPCPX is an adenosine A1 antagonist that may have some selectivity for F508-CFTR compared with effects on wild-type CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	84	 DPCPX stimulates F508-CFTR channels in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cells (8, 15).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In some cells, correction of the CF defect by transfection with the CFTR gene rendered the transfected cells insensitive to DPCPX.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In contrast, DPCPX stimulated recombinant CFTR channels from HEK cell microsomal membranes incorporated into planar lipid layers (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The effects of DPCPX seemed not to be due to an effect on A1 receptors, because Northern analysis showed that a DPCPX-sensitive cell line (CFPAC-1) had no A1 receptor mRNA, and another xanthine analog 1,3-diallyl-8-cyclohexylxanthine (DAX) was a potent CFTR activator but a poor A1 adenosine receptor antagonist.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Using a rapid membrane filtration assay, Cohen et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	89	 (6) reported that DPCPX bound to NBD1 of F508-CFTR [dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	90	0 nM] with an affinity 17 times higher than that to NBD1 of wild-type CFTR (Kd = 17.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	91	0 nM) with a rank order among different xanthines of DAX  >  DPCPX  >  caffeine  >  DA-DPCPX  >  adenosine  >  >  IBMX  >  2-thio-DPCPX.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	92	 These results were consistent with a unique binding site for DPCPX and related xanthines on NBD1 of CFTR in the vicinity of F508 (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	93	 DPCPX was ~25-fold more potent than IBMX in potentiating F508-CFTR by a mechanism other than elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration (15).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Stimulation of CFTR by DPCPX or DAX required prephosphorylated CFTR (2).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Thus DPCPX (and likely all the other xanthines, including IBMX), genistein, and NS-004 all seemed to activate prephosphorylated CFTR by binding directly to CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	96	 DPCPX appeared to bind to NBD1 rather than to NBD2, and it also seemed to be more selective for F508-CFTR than wild-type CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	97	Pharmacological stimulation of mutant CFTR and therapeutic potential.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The most common mutation in CF, F508-CFTR, leads to a trafficking-impaired protein that gets degraded in the cell (40).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Some mutations lead to trafficking-competent, but misfunctional, proteins (e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	100	 It appears that mutants with different misfunctions will need selective treatments.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	101	 For example, genistein failed to activate F508-CFTR in CF bronchial epithelial cells (22), but addition of genistein and cAMP agonists to NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing F508-CFTR caused a strong, synergistic activation (18).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Alternatively, when CF nasal epithelial cells were treated with 4-phenylbutyrate or low temperature to increase expression of F508-CFTR in the membrane (31, 40), genistein was a potent stimulant (9).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In addition, the trafficking-competent G551D-CFTR mutant expressed in fibroblasts was stimulated by the combination of genistein and forskolin when forskolin alone was ineffective (9).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	104	 These data indicate that genistein targets CFTR mutants present in the plasma membrane.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Both NS-004 and, especially, DPCPX have also been shown to activate F508-CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	106	 IBMX produced a small, CFTR-related secretory response in jejunum, cecum, and rectum from G551D mice but had no effect in the nasal epithelium (36).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	107	 NS-004 restored near normal channel activity from P574H-CFTR (a mild, trafficking-impaired mutation in NBD1) (3).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	108	 These results suggest that, in addition to their direct effects on CFTR, these drugs may also have other effects that increase the number of channel proteins found in the membrane.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It is also important to remember that there may be tissue-specific effects of the drugs, because epithelial cells will require concomitant activity of basolateral K+ channels to secrete fluid efficiently.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	110	    HCO3 PERMEATION AND POSSIBLE REGULATION OF CFTR-MEDIATED CL CURRENTS.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	111	Background: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion across intestine.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	112	 HCO3 secretion is a key function that occurs in the stomach, pancreas, and small and large intestine.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	113	 HCO3 secretion is particularly important in the duodenum to protect the intestinal mucosa against damage from large amounts of acid from the stomach (1).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Transepithelial secretion of HCO3 likely involves the concerted activities of an apical anion channel, Cl/HCO3 exchange, HCO3 uptake across the basolateral membrane, and/or production of HCO3 by intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The paracellular pathway may also contribute, since a transepithelial gradient for HCO3 favoring secretion occurs.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Electrogenic HCO3 secretion is activated by secretagogues that increase intracellular cAMP, cGMP, or Ca2+ concentrations (1), and this HCO3 secretion required the presence of CFTR in all segments of the small intestine in mice (16, 17, 33).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	117	 However, the specific mechanism(s) involved remains a mystery.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	118	 With the use of the pH stat method in combination with inhibitors of anion exchange and CFTR, recent work (5) with duodenum from normal and CFTR knockout mice shows that CFTR may have contributed to HCO3 secretion in two ways: directly by conducting HCO3 into the lumen and also indirectly by conducting Cl into the lumen, which could be recycled back into the cell via anion exchange for HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Because CFTR is expressed at highest levels in the crypts (7), electrogenic HCO3 secretion is predicted to occur primarily in this region.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In contrast, CFTR is expressed at lower levels and carbonic anhydrase activity is expressed at higher levels in the villus epithelium, so CFTR-coupled Cl/HCO3 exchange activity may be primarily localized to the villus.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	121	Does CFTR conduct HCO3? Patch-clamp studies showed that HCO3 was conducted through CFTR in NIH/3T3 cells recombinantly expressing wild-type CFTR (26), with a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Similar measurements have also been presented recently by Linsdell et al.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	123	 (25), who found a permeability ratio of Cl to HCO3 of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	124	 We also measured CFTR-mediated permeation of HCO3 across the apical membrane of Calu-3 monolayers, and conductance ratios of cAMP-stimulated HCO3 and Cl currents of 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Thus HCO3-to-Cl permeability or conductance ratios of CFTR ranged from 0.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	126	 A role of CFTR's function as a HCO3 conductor has also been suggested in CF models using a variety of methods comparing wild-type CFTR-expressing cells with F508-CFTR-expressing CF cells (22, 35) or wild-type with CFTR knockout mice (CFTR /) (5, 13, 17, 33).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	127	 These reports suggested the possibility that a defect in HCO3 secretion through CFTR may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF pulmonary disease (22, 35).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In contrast to these experiments that showed that CFTR conducts HCO3, Quinton and Reddy (28) (P.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Quinton, personal communication) showed using microelectrode methods that in intact sweat ducts HCO3 was equally impermeant through CFTR as gluconate.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This contradiction remains unresolved.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	131	Does CFTR contribute to cytosolic and/or extracellular pH regulation? If CFTR is permeant to HCO3, it is expected that it should contribute to movements of HCO3 into and out of the cell and thereby alter pH of the cell or extracellular fluids.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In NIH/3T3 cells expressing exogenous CFTR, we showed forskolin-stimulated changes of pH that were absent in cells expressing F508-CFTR (26).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Data have also been presented for biliary epithelial cells showing that CFTR may regulate the activity of the anion exchanger and alter cytosolic pH regulatory ability in these cells (14) In contrast, we have recently compared cytosolic pH regulation in CF and CFTR-corrected nasal cells and found no apparent differences (L.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	134	 A possible explanation was that these cells expressed Na+/H+ and Cl/HCO3 exchange and Na+-HCO3 cotransport, and these mechanisms were much more prominent than CFTR in regulating cytosolic pH.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Thus, in cells that express prominent activity of transporters that regulate cytosolic pH, the conductive pathway for HCO3 across CFTR might be of minor importance for cytosolic pH regulation.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	136	 However, CFTR might still contribute importantly to the accumulation of HCO3 in the poorly buffered apical/luminal fluid.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	137	Do anions regulate Cl permeation through CFTR? It has been well described that thiocyanate (SCN) is highly permeant across CFTR, but when mixtures of Cl and SCN are used, the conductance of CFTR decreases (37).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This effect has been interpreted in terms of multi-ion pore behavior of CFTR, i.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	139	, interactions of anions within the pore can lead to anomalous effects.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Also, the halide anion I both permeated and blocked CFTR.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We have similarly shown that both F and HCO3 added to the apical surface reduced Cl conductance of CFTR in Calu-3 cells (Illek and Machen, unpublished observations).
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In vivo both Cl and HCO3 are present in the cytosol at similar concentrations, and both are driven by the membrane potential into the pore of CFTR, suggesting that both ions may compete for common binding sites in the permeation path, and thus affect the permeation of each other.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This could be particularly important for tissues that secrete large amounts of HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	144	Summary: Role of CFTR in HCO3 secretion.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The exact role of CFTR in HCO3 permeation under physiological conditions likely depends on the relative expression of CFTR and other HCO3 channels, HCO3 transporters and paracellular permeability of HCO3.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In addition, the cell-to-lumen electrochemical driving forces for Cl and HCO3 will determine ion movements across the luminal cell membrane and tight junctions.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	147	 CFTR appears to be important both as a HCO3 conductance and also in some way as a direct or indirect regulator of adjacent anion exchange, e.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	148	, as a source of luminal Cl that may exchange for cellular HCO3 and/or as a means of keeping cellular Cl concentration low enough that the anion exchanger operates as an HCO3 secretion mechanism.
0.56830734.9843756.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Many CFTR-expressing epithelia, including the intestine, pancreas, and liver, exhibit different gradients of Cl and HCO3 along the length of the organ, so these relationships will also be affected by the anatomic structures.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	5	We have previously described a protocol for the simultaneous isolation and reconstitution of a protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive outwardly rectified chloride channel (ORCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from bovine tracheal epithelium.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented PKA activation of the ORCC, suggesting that CFTR regulated the ORCC and that this regulatory relationship was preserved throughout the purification procedure.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We now report the purification of CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia and the purification of a CFTR conduction mutant (G551D CFTR) from retrovirally transduced mouse L cells using a combination of alkali stripping, Triton-X extraction, and immunoaffinity chromatography.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Immunopurified CFTR proteins were reconstituted in the absence and presence of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	9	 To test the hypothesis that only functional CFTR can support activation of ORCC by PKA and ATP, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR peptide antibody or G551D CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	10	 When anti-CFTR peptide antibodies were present prior to the addition of PKA and ATP, activation of both the ORCC and CFTR was prevented.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	11	 If the antibody was added after activation of the ORCC and CFTR Cl channels by PKA and ATP, only the CFTR Cl channel was inhibited.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	12	 When ORCC and G551D CFTR were co-incorporated into planar bilayers, only the ORCC was recorded and this channel could not be further activated by the addition of PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Thus, functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We also tested the hypothesis that PKA activation of ORCC was dependent on the extracellular presence of ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We added ATP on the presumed extracellular side of the lipid bilayer under conditions where it was not possible to activate the ORCC, i.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	16	 in the presence of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibody or G551D CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In both cases the ORCC regained PKA sensitivity.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Moreover, the addition of hexokinase + glucose to the extracellular side prevented activation of the ORCCs by PKA and ATP in the presence of CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These experiments confirm that both the presence of CFTR as well as the presence of ATP on the extracellular side is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	20	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ()and outwardly rectified chloride channels (ORCC) both contribute to cAMP-activated chloride conductance in normal, but not in cystic fibrosis (CF), airway cells (1, 2) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	21	 ORCCs are present in the apical membranes of CF airway epithelia, but they cannot be activated by protein kinase A (PKA) and ATP(3, 4, 5) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	22	 CFTR channels are regulated by PKA and ATP and are inhibited by the channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) but not by 4,4`-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2`-disulfonic acid (DIDS)(6, 7) , whereas ORCCs are DIDS-sensitive.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Although CFTR and ORCC channels are distinct proteins, they are linked through unknown regulatory pathways.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Different mechanisms by which CFTR might regulate the ORCC can be envisioned.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	25	 For example, CFTR could interact directly with the ORCC protein in the apical membrane, regulation could be a consequence of the channel function of CFTR, or both.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	26	 It has been shown that CFTR can act as both an ATP and a Cl channel(6) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recently Guggino's group (7) demonstrated that ATP transported through CFTR acts as an autocrine stimulator of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The proposed mechanism of regulation is via a P receptor that, either through a direct coupling to the ORCC or through a G protein-coupled signaling pathway, stimulates the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	29	Increasing evidence suggests heterogeneity in the molecular pathogenesis of CF.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Some mutations, such as the deletion of a phenylalanine at position 508 (Phe-508) of CFTR, cause CFTR to be processed improperly within epithelial cells, and disease may result because the mutant protein fails to traffic to the apical cell membrane.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Other mutations, such as the relatively common glycine aspartic acid replacement at CFTR position 551 (G551D, 3% of all mutations), appear to be processed and targeted normally to the plasma membrane, but lack responsiveness to stimulation by cAMP(8) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It is not known how different mutational forms of CFTR affect regulation of the ORCC by PKA.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	33	Amino acid sequence analysis suggests that CFTR is composed of two motifs, each containing a membrane-spanning domain (MSD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) linked by a regulatory R domain(9) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recently, Welsh and colleagues (10) demonstrated that the amino-terminal portion of CFTR, which includes MSD1, NBD1, and the R domain, forms a regulated Cl channel.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It has been shown previously that an even smaller part of CFTR, namely NBD1 (amino acids 426-588), can form an anion channel when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers(11) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is not known if these portions of the CFTR molecule can also transport ATP or if they are sufficient to replace intact CFTR in the regulation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	37	We recently reported the simultaneous isolation and functional reconstitution of an ORCC and CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia(12) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The regulatory relationship between these channel proteins was preserved throughout the purification procedure, as demonstrated by the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Immunoprecipitation of CFTR from this preparation prevented the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP, suggesting that the presence of CFTR is required for PKA-dependent activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, these experiments did not distinguish if functional CFTR was essential for conferring PKA sensitivity to the ORCC, if only the physical interaction of CFTR was required, or both.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	41	We thus tested the hypothesis that the functional form of CFTR is required for PKA activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In order to achieve this goal, we used an inhibitory anti-CFTR peptide antibody (13, 14, 15) to block CFTR transport function or replaced functional CFTR with a nonfunctional mutant form of CFTR, namely G551D CFTR(8) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Our results indicate that only when CFTR is functional can the ORCC be activated by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Our results also are consistent with the hypothesis of Schwiebert et al.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (7) that the transport of ATP by CFTR to the extracellular side of the cells is necessary for PKA activation of the ORCC.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	149	 In the experiment shown (representative of 18 out of a total 33), 300  microM DPC completely blocked channel activity when added to one side of the bilayer (usually trans).
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In the other 15 experiments, DPC was ineffective when added to this one side of the bilayer.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Thus, addition of 300  microM DPC was made to the opposite side; this resulted in abolished channel activity.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	155	 For these experiments we used immunopurified material obtained using p38 antibodies that contained CFTR co-purified with the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Current rectification of the ORCC allowed us to determine the sidedness of the incorporated channels.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Moreover, the incorporation of proteins into negatively charged bilayers held at -80 mV permitted us to perform oriented reconstitutions.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The cytoplasmic (PKA-sensitive) portion of both channels faced the cis compartment, while the extracellular portion faced the trans compartment in more than 90% of successful incorporations of ORCC + CFTR, as assessed by PKA activation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Another observation allowed us to determine whether CFTR was co-reconstituted into the bilayer membrane prior to PKA activation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Current-voltage (I/V) curves of ORCC in the presence of nonphosphorylated CFTR were slightly less rectified in the negative voltage quadrant compared with when CFTR was absent (Fig.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	161	 This distinction was important because in a few experiments when PKA + ATP failed to activate ORCC incorporated into the bilayer membrane (3 out of 72), using the criterion described above, we concluded that CFTR was not present in the bilayer.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the exact molar ratio of ORCC and CFTR necessary for interaction from these bilayer experiments, because in other comparable experiments two to five CFTR channels per single ORCC have been observed.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In contrast to these results obtained with anti-CFTR antibodies added after PKA + ATP activation of incorporated channels, addition of inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies prior to addition of PKA and ATP prevented activation of both CFTR and ORCC by PKA + ATP (n = 11; Fig.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Separation of ORCC from co-purified ORCC and CFTR was achieved by immunodepletion of CFTR from the preparation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The removal of CFTR was confirmed by the absence of a 170-kDa phosphoprotein and lack of activation by PKA + ATP of reconstituted ORCC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, as described earlier (12) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	194	 G551D CFTR was immunopurified as described under ``Methods'' and co-reconstituted with the preparation containing ORCC but devoid of CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	195	 For replacement of normal CFTR with G551D CFTR we used autoradiography/densitometry to estimate the intensity of the in vitro phosphorylated CFTR (170 kDa) band and replaced normal CFTR with a similar amount of G551D CFTR, as G551D CFTR can also be in vitro phosphorylated.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Under these conditions following incorporation into the bilayer, only the ORCC was recorded with no change in open probability upon addition of PKA and ATP to one (either cis or trans) side of the bilayer (P = 0.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The presence of G551D CFTR, like incorporation of wild type CFTR, produced a change in the rectification properties of ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In only 2 experiments from a total 26 performed, ORCC incorporated from liposomes presumably containing both ORCC and G551D CFTR displayed properties identical to ORCC incorporated from CFTR-immunodepleted preparations.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	202	 These observations allowed us to conclude that the change of rectification was indicative of the presence of G551D CFTR in a bilayer containing ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Nonetheless, the ORCC was not activated by PKA + ATP in these experiments (n = 9), thus supporting the hypothesis that the conductive form of CFTR was required for the activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	204	 However, in three experiments in which PKA and ATP were added to both sides of a bilayer containing ORCC and G551D CFTR, the activity of ORCC was increased 2-fold (from 0.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, when ORCC alone was incorporated into a bilayer, this channel could not be activated by addition of 100  microM ATP to the ``outside'' and PKA + ATP to the ``inside'' or by PKA + ATP to both bathing solutions (see Fig.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	232	 However, in four separate experiments, we found that NBD1 could not substitute for full-sized CFTR in the regulation of ORCC by PKA and ATP added from either or both sides of the membrane.

0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	245	 We cannot at present exclude the co-purification of a purinergic receptor by our procedures.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, it is unlikely that a receptor-coupled mechanism would be active in the bilayer system because of the absence of necessary signaling molecules.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	247	 However, the failure of ORCC to be activated by PKA + ATP in the presence of external ATP supports the idea that a purinergic receptor mediated pathway does not co-purify in our preparation.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The second finding revealed by our study is that a nonconductive form of CFTR (G551D) was able to support activation of the ORCC by PKA when ATP was present on the extracellular side of the incorporated channels.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	249	It has been shown previously that the portion of CFTR that includes MSD1, NBD1, and the R domain, or even smaller parts of CFTR (NBD1 amino acids 426-588), can form Cl channels(10, 11) .
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	250	 We tested whether NBD1 could substitute for CFTR in the regulation of the ORCC by PKA by ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Under the conditions used in these studies, NBD1 did not form a channel in the bilayer and therefore was not able to substitute for CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Furthermore, a recombinant NBD1 purified from prokaryotic cells was unable to support activation by PKA of the ORCC in the presence of exogenously added extracellular ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Taken together these results suggest that there is a minimal size requirement of CFTR necessary to subserve its regulatory role in the PKA-related activation of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	254	In summary, we have immunopurified and functionally reconstituted CFTR from bovine trachea and nonconductive G551D CFTR from transduced L cells.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In combination with previously co-purified ORCC and CFTR from bovine tracheal epithelia, and inhibitory anti-CFTR antibodies, we were able to explore the regulatory relationship between the ORCC and CFTR.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We have shown that functional CFTR is required for activation of the ORCC by PKA and ATP.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	257	 CFTR is apparently required to transport ATP from the cytoplasm to the extracellular bathing solution, where it can then interact with some external domain of the ORCC.
0.4846223.7493947.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The observation that the ORCC cannot be activated by extracellular ATP and PKA + ATP added to the cytoplasmic side in the absence of the CFTR molecule also suggests that, in addition to the transport (ATP) function of CFTR, a direct interaction between CFTR and ORCC is essential to confer PKA sensitivity to the ORCC.
