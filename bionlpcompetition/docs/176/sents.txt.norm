0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	406	Biochemical evidence suggests CAL exist multimer mediated domains N terminal region
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	407	CAL form clusters CFTR within cell overexpressed suggesting multimers CAL may tether one CFTR within cell mechanism regulate export plasma membrane
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	408	This consistent data overexpression CAL suppresses CFTR expression cell surface
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	409	In contrast effect CFTR CAL affect VSVG surface expression see Fig

0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	421	There least two possible scenarios explain CAL may interact CFTR
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	422	First CAL may part anterograde trafficking complex controls CFTR movement ER Golgi plasma membrane
0.44482413.11707463.html.plaintext.txt	423	CAL two coiled coil domains may tether CFTR Golgi requisite step moving CFTR cell surface
