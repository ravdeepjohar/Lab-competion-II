0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	5	 While the initial phase relies solely on cellular transcription factors, the subsequent phase is activated by the viral Tat transactivator.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We have previously reported that the subsequent phase of viral gene transcription can be repressed by the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) in human microglial cells [O.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we demonstrate that CTIP proteins also repress the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription, mainly supported by the cellular transcription factors Sp1 and COUP-TF in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report that CTIP2 represses Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication as a result of physical interactions with COUP-TF and Sp1 in microglial nuclei.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Using laser confocal microscopy CTIP2 was found to colocalize with Sp1, COUP-TF and the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1, which is mainly detected in transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Moreover, we describe that CTIP2 can be recruited to the HIV-1 promoter via its association with Sp1 bound to the GC-box sequences of the long terminal repeat (LTR).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Since our findings demonstrate that CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 proximal promoter, it is likely that CTIP2 promotes HIV-1 gene silencing by forcing transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic environment to the viral LTR region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a spectrum of neurological damage, ranging from acute encephalopathies to AIDS dementia (1,2).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The CNS constitutes a sanctuary and a reservoir for the virus despite antiretroviral therapies (3).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Microglial cells, the CNS resident macrophages, may be particularly suitable for this purpose because they are long lived, HIV productive for several weeks and relatively immune to virus-induced cytopathology [reviewed in (4)].
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Since microglial cells are the primary targets of HIV-1 productive infection within the CNS (5,6), investigation on HIV-1 repression in these cells are important for the global understanding of HIV pathogenesis and for the development of anti-HIV strategies.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	16	HIV-1 gene transcription is a key step in the control of the virus life cycle [reviewed in (7)].
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Viral gene transcription is characterized by two temporally distinct phases.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The initial phase occurs immediately after integration and relies solely on cellular transcription factors.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Most of the transcripts cannot elongate efficiently and terminate rapidly after initiation.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, a few transcripts elongate throughout the genome, resulting in transcription and expression of the viral transactivator Tat.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The subsequent phase of transcription occurs when enough Tat protein has accumulated.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Tat binds to TAR, recruits pTEFb complex and dramatically stimulates HIV-1 gene transcription [reviewed in (8,9)].
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	23	We have previously studied some of the cellular transcription factors that impact HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI)/Ear3, Arp1/COUP-TFII and Ear2/COUP-TFIII proteins are the three members of the COUP-TF orphan nuclear receptors superfamily.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We have described that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFI/Ear3 (10,11) is expressed in numerous human CNS cell lineages, including microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	26	 COUP-TFI is an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription in oligodendrocytes (12), microglia (13) and T lymphocytes (14).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, we have revealed the importance of functional interactions between the nuclear factor for interleukin 6 (NF-Il6), Sp1 and COUP-TFI in the regulation of the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells (15).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The transcription factor Sp1 is one of the crucial cellular proteins for efficient HIV-1 gene transcription (16 to 18).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A number of studies have reported that Sp1 can serve as an anchor for indirect binding of other transcription factors to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In all cell types, an interaction between Sp1 and Tat is required for optimal HIV-enhancer activation (19).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, Sp1 is able to recruit the Cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb to the LTR, which helps to bypass a requirement for TAR/Tat and promotes processive transcription without Tat (20).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In microglial cells, the main HIV-1 target cells in the brain (6), Sp1 anchors COUP-TF (13) and NF-IL6 (15) to the three GC-boxes adjacent to the viral CATA box.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The CATA box is used instead of the TATAA box for optimal HIV-1 gene transcription and replication (21).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We have shown that Sp1 and COUP-TF interact and cooperate in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene transcription (13).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Moreover, COUP-TF can substitute to Sp1 association with the viral Tat protein to restore Tat function and HIV-1 replication in microglial cells (22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These results highlight the key roles of Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins in HIV-1 expression in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	37	Members of the COUP-TF family have been shown to bind related zinc finger proteins named COUP-TF-interacting protein 1 (CTIP1) and 2 (CTIP2) that are highly expressed in brain and immune systems (23,24).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Recent results support the selective contribution of these proteins in the development and function of the nervous and immune systems (24).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We recently described that the nuclear cofactor CTIP2 inhibits the subsequent phase of HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication by relocating the viral transactivator Tat protein to transcriptionally inactive regions of chromatin via Hp1 (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In the present work, CTIP2 overexpression leads to the repression of HIV-1 replication.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In contrast, CTIP1 was unable to affect Tat function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Using confocal microscopy to visualize Tat subcellular distribution in the presence of each CTIP proteins, we found that CTIP2, but not CTIP1, leads to the disruption of Tat nuclear localization and to its recruitment within CTIP2-induced nuclear ball-like structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In addition, we showed that CTIP2 and Hp1 associate with Tat to form a three-protein complex.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	44	 These findings suggest that the inhibition of HIV-1 expression by CTIP2 correlates with the recruitment of Tat within CTIP2-induced structures and its relocalization within inactive regions of chromatin.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	45	On line with this study, we noticed that CTIP proteins also affect HIV-1 gene transcription in the absence of Tat, which means that CTIP proteins may also impair endogenous cellular transcription factor functions of importance for the initial phase of HIV-1 gene transcription.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	46	Here, we report that CTIP proteins repress HIV-1 gene transcription via the proximal LTR region which binds Sp1 and COUP-TF transactivators.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Since COUP-TF and Sp1 cellular transcription factors are two of the major contributors to HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells, we have postulated that Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated LTR-driven activation may be impaired by CTIP1 and CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We report here that both CTIP1 and CTIP2 repress Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Since the CTIP2 repressive activity is much stronger than the CTIP1-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication, we focused our study on CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	50	 CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 and COUP-TF functions results from direct physical interactions of these cellular transcription factors with CTIP2.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Association with CTIP2 forces Sp1 and COUP-TF relocation to CTIP2-induced subnuclear structures containing the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Moreover, CTIP2 can be recruited to the HIV-1 promoter by a physical association with Sp1 bound to the GC-box regions of the LTR.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Since Sp1 or COUP-TF transcription factors are necessary for the Tat function in microglial cells (22), CTIP2-mediated repression of COUP-TF and Sp1 functions may largely contribute to the previously described CTIP2-mediated impairment of Tat activity and viral replication in microglial cells (25).

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	108	 To delineate the LTR region responsible for CTIP1- and CTIP2-mediated HIV-1 gene transcriptional repression, microglial cells were transfected with a 5' deleted pLTR-CAT reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of CTIP1 and CTIP2 expression vectors.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Deletion of the 5' region downstream of the two proximal GC-box sequences did not affect CTIP1 and CTIP2 ability to repress LTR-driven CAT activity (Figure 1, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that CTIP proteins repressive function can be mediated by the proximal region of the LTR encompassing two GC-box sequences, the CATA sequence (21) and the TAR region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	110	 We have previously observed that the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3, are directly bound to the LTR GC-box sequences in microglial cells (13).

0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	271	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In a recent work, we have revealed the importance of the cellular transcription factors, Sp1 and COUP-TFI/Ear3, in the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in microglial cells (13).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	272	 We have shown that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF associates and cooperates with Sp1 in the activation of LTR-driven transcription.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	273	 CTIP1 (Bcl11a, Evi9) and CTIP2 (Bcl11b, Rit1ss) are related transcriptional regulatory proteins that have been shown to bind members of the COUP-TF family (23).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	274	 In a more recent work, we have described that the nuclear cofactor CTIP2 inhibits the subsequent phase of HIV-1 gene transcription by relocating the viral Tat protein to transcriptionally inactive regions of chromatin via Hp1 (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	275	Here, we addressed the mechanism whereby CTIP2 impairs the initial phase (prior to Tat expression) of HIV-1 gene transcription in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	276	We report that CTIP proteins inhibit Sp1- and COUP-TF-mediated activation of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	277	 To decipher the mechanism whereby CTIP2 alters COUP-TF and Sp1 functions, we examined whether these proteins interact in vitro and in cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	278	 GST pull-down experiments revealed that CTIP2 associates with the N-terminal region of COUP-TF and with the C-terminal region of Sp1 in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In this way, CTIP2 presents two interfaces for Sp1 and COUP-TF interactions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	280	 COUP-TF and Sp1 proteins bind the central and the C-terminal region of CTIP2 in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These results are consistent with the previously reported interface domains of Arp1 (COUP-TFII) with CTIP1 (23).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Confocal microscopy observations of COUP-TF and Sp1 location in the presence or absence of CTIP2 reveal that CTIP2 colocalizes with COUP-TF and Sp1 within nuclear ball-like structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Moreover, the heterochromatin-associated protein Hp1 is also present in these structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	284	 There are three Hp1 protein family members in mammals, Hp1, Hp1ss and Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The Hp1 isoform is mainly detected in transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region (36).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Thus, the colocalization of CTIP2 with endogenous Sp1, COUP-TF and Hp1 proteins as reported here strongly suggests that these proteins are relocated to transcriptionally inactive regions of heterochromatin in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Those CTIP2-induced structures may represent a new class of nuclear structures (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Moreover, our observations may favor the hypothesis, suggesting that the formation of nuclear bodies inhibits HIV-1 gene transcription by sequestering a variety of factors required for transcriptional activation [reviewed in (37)].
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	289	Co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that the described subnuclear colocalization results from physical interactions between Sp1, COUP-TF, Hp1 and CTIP2 in the nucleus of microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Since Hp1, Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins associate with CTIP2 in microglial cells, we address their respective interaction interfaces in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Our findings show that the central zinc finger domain of CTIP2 may preferentially bind Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins, while the C-terminal region may bind to Hp1.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In the presence of the viral Tat transactivator, CTIP2 also associates with Hp1 via its C-terminal region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Taken together, these findings suggest a permanent association of CTIP2 with Hp1 via its C-terminal region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The central domain of CTIP2 may be reserved for the interactions with the functionally repressed transcription factors.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Our observations indicate that COUP-TF and Sp1 could bind together to CTIP2 and that COUP-TF and CTIP2 do not compete for Sp1 binding.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Those findings suggest the formation of a ternary complex, including COUP-TF, Sp1 and CTIP2 proteins.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Thereby, CTIP2 links these transcriptional activators to transcriptionally repressed heterochromatic region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	298	 CTIP1 and CTIP2 proteins have been described as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (33).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	299	 The core-binding site identified in this study is highly related to the canonical GC-box sequence.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Since Sp1 anchors COUP-TF to the GC-box sequence of the viral LTR region (12), we addressed how CTIP2 interacts with the HIV-1 promoter.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Our findings demonstrate that CTIP2 is not able to directly bind the three viral GC-box sequences in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	302	 CTIP2 is recruited to the HIV-1 LTR via its association with Sp1 bound to this region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Moreover, CTIP2 is not in competition with COUP-TF for Sp1-mediated anchorage to the viral promoter, indicating that the three proteins are linked together to the LTR in vitro.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The ChIP experiments conducted in a cellular context confirm that CTIP2, Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins do bind the proximal region of the HIV-1 promoter in chromatin-integrated and non-integrated contexts.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	305	The surprising reduction of Sp1 or COUP-TF binding to the viral promoter in the presence of CTIP2 apparently does not agree with the in vitro observations.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	306	 We show that Sp1 anchors CTIP2 and COUP-TF to the HIV-1 LTR and that Sp1 binding to the GC-box sequence is necessary for CTIP2 recruitment to this region.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Nevertheless, since Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins are not accessible to their related antibodies in the CTIP2-induced nuclear structures, one wonders whether the observation of reduced binding to the LTR may result from protein sequestration and/or chromatin environment.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	308	 ChIP experiments also indicate that CTIP2 promotes Hp1 recruitment to the LTR encompassing the Sp1 binding sequences.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Mutation of the Sp1 binding sites abolished this recruitment.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Taken together, these results suggest that the Sp1-mediated anchorage of CTIP2 to the HIV-1 LTR region may recruit a large complex that promotes Hp1 association, heterochromatin environment and viral gene transcriptional silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	311	 In Jurkat cells, CTIP2 associates with the histone deacetylase SirT1 in a large complex.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	312	 CTIP2-mediated recruitment of SirT1 to promoter template results in a deacetylation of the bound histones H3 and H4 and in a transcriptional repression (35).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	313	 The chromatin structure close to the HIV-1 gene promoter is involved in viral post-integration latency phenomenon (38).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Further studies will be necessary to examine the CTIP2-recruited complex that promotes HIV-1 gene silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	315	To control whether the CTIP2 repressive function is mediated by Sp1 binding sites, we have examined its ability to repress a heterologous promoter containing three consensus GC-boxes.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Our findings reveal that GC-box sequences are sufficient for CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 stimulation, suggesting that CTIP2 may impact the transcriptional activity of other GC-box containing promoters.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In agreement with these observations, CTIP2 is still able to repress LTR-driven transcriptional activity of a LTR deleted downstream of the GC-box sequences.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Recruitment of CTIP1 to the template by a COUP-TF family member has been found to result in a transcriptional repression of a reporter gene harboring a COUP-TF binding site (23).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In the context of the HIV-1 promoter, deletion of the previously described COUP-TF binding site did not impact CTIP2 repressive function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Moreover, EMSA and ChIP experiments demonstrate that CTIP2 interacts with the proximal region of the LTR excluding the COUP-TF binding sequence.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Taken together, these findings indicate that the COUP-TF binding sequence, located downstream to the GC-box region, might not be implicated in the CTIP2 repressive functions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	322	 As widely reported, deletion of the LTR GC-box region results in a drastic ( > 90%) reduction of the LTR-driven transcriptional activity (13 to 15,22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	323	 These observations confirm the crucial contribution of Sp1 and COUP-TF transcription factors to support viral gene transcription in microglial cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Moreover, they highlight the importance of CTIP2-mediated repression of Sp1 and COUP-TF protein functions.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Most of the 80% CTIP2-mediated reduction of the basal transcriptional level may be charged on to this repressive activity.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Surprisingly, CTIP2 is still able to repress the 10% remaining transcriptional activity driven by a GC-box deleted LTR, suggesting that CTIP2 may also be able to repress the expression of mutated strains of virus.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	327	 This remaining activity represents  < 10% of the global CTIP2-mediated repressive activity.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	328	Nevertheless, we have previously suggested that COUP-TF restores the viral Tat function in the context of a GC-box mutated LTR by anchoring Tat to the basal transcriptional machinery (22).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Interestingly, we observed that CTIP2 is also able to repress this functional cooperation (C.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	330	 These results suggest that, in this context, COUP-TF may bind CTIP2 via its N-terminal region and the general transcription factor TFIIB via its C-terminal part as described previously (39).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Thus, in the absence of Sp1-mediated linkage to the GC-box region of the HIV-1 LTR, CTIP2 may bypass Sp1 association by a COUP-TF-mediated linkage to the basal transcriptional machinery.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Moreover, this proposed indirect linkage might be weak since it appeared undetectable by ChIP experiments.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Along this line, CTIP2 might also associate to some other cellular transcription factors yet to be characterized.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	334	These studies fully complete those reporting CTIP2-mediated repression of the viral Tat function (25).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Since Sp1 or COUP-TF association is necessary for Tat function in microglial cells (22), it can be postulated that CTIP2-mediated impairment of Sp1 and COUP-TF function contributes to the previously observed repression of Tat function.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	336	The chromatin structure at the site of provirus integration is reminiscent to post-integration latency phenomenon (38).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	337	 In vitro, latent T-cell clones frequently contain HIV-1 genome integrated in heterochromatin structures.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	338	 This is in contrast to a productive infection where integration in or near heterochromatin is disfavored (40).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	339	 No antiretroviral drugs that are currently available can inhibit transcription of HIV RNA from the integrated HIV proviral DNA in infected cells.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Nevertheless, HDAC inhibitors are able to induce quiescent provirus, suggesting that derepression of heterochromatin structures may force viral expression from latently infected reservoirs (41,42).
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Thus, investigation on factors that may promote heterochromatin structures to the viral gene promoter, such as CTIP2, appears crucial for understanding these phenomena and for the development of new anti-HIV strategies.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	342	 At this stage, further studies will be necessary to precisely examine the CTIP2-associated enzymatic activities that promote transcriptional silencing.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	343	 In addition, since our investigations were restricted to the transcriptional step of the viral life cycle, it cannot be excluded that CTIP2 also counteracts other critical steps necessary to optimal viral replication.
0.29273772.15849318.html.plaintext.txt	344	 This possibility needs further clarification.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	2	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are orphan receptors that belong to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor (TR) superfamily and can repress the transcriptional activity of several target genes; however, the precise mechanism of this repression is unknown.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Transfection of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI (Gal4-COUP-TFI) significantly represses the basal transcriptional activity of a reporter gene containing Gal4-binding sites.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Cotransfection of COUP-TFI can relieve the Gal4-COUP-TFI repression in a dose-dependent manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In contrast, COUP-TFI35, which lacks the repressor domain (the C-terminal 35 amino acids), fails to relieve this repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This finding suggests that the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may squelch a limiting amount of corepressor in HeLa cells.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, increasing concentrations of TRss also can relieve the COUP-TFI repression in a hormone-sensitive manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Similarly, overexpression of increasing concentration of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the silencing activity of the unliganded TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Collectively, these results indicate that COUP-TFI and TRss share a common corepressor(s) for their silencing activity.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	10	 To determine which corepressor is involved in the COUP-TF-silencing activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid and in vitro GST pull-down assays to demonstrate that COUP-TFI can interact with the fragment of N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) encoding amino acids 921-2453 and the fragments of SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and TR) encoding amino acids 29 to 564 and 565-1289, respectively.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Interestingly, the fragment of SMRT encoding amino acids 1192 to 1495, which strongly interacts with TRss, interacts very weakly with COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, overexpression of N-CoR or SMRT potentiates the silencing activity of COUP-TFI and can relieve the COUP-TFI-mediated squelching of Gal4-COUP-TFI activity.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Therefore, our studies indicate that N-CoR and SMRT act as corepressors for the COUP-TFI silencing activity.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Steroid/thyroid hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate diverse aspects of growth, development, and homeostasis by binding as monomer, homodimers, or heterodimers to their cognate DNA response elements to modulate transcription of target genes (1, 2, 3).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) bind to cognate DNA response elements and repress basal promoter activity in the absence of ligand (3, 4, 5).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The region important for repression may represent a unique interaction surface for contacting a particular target within the basal transcriptional machinery.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Highly charged regions are a common feature of other repression motifs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These charged regions consist of basic residues (6) or acidic residues (7, 8).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In contrast to these well-defined small repression motifs, the homologous repression regions of TR and RAR are large and appear to include multiple regions within the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) and hinge regions.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Many interacting proteins have been identified and proposed to be important for mediating the repressor function.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The identified molecular targets of repressors can be categorized into three groups (9): basal transcription factors, activators, and coregulators, such as coactivators and corepressors.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	22	Silencing activity of unliganded TR and RAR requires limiting factors termed corepressors (5).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recently, two corepressors that bind to unliganded TR and RAR have been cloned using a yeast two-hybrid screen: N-CoR (nuclear receptor-corepressor) (10, 11) and SMRT (silencing mediator for RAR and TR) (12, 13, 14, 15).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Binding of these corepressors is necessary for unliganded receptors to silence the activity of target promoters.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Prevailing evidence suggests that binding of hormone changes the conformation of the receptors, which results in the release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivators, thereby abolishing their silencing activity.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These two corepressors exhibit significant sequence homologies in their receptor-interacting domains, suggesting the existence of a corepressor gene family.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	27	 COUP-TFs (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors) belong to the steroid receptor superfamily and are classified as orphan receptors because their ligand has yet to be defined.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	28	 There are two COUP-TF genes in mammals, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	29	 COUP-TFs have been implicated in neurogenesis, organogenesis, and cell fate determination (16, 17, 18, 19).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	30	 COUP-TFs can form stable homodimers and bind to a variety of hormone response elements recognized by other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, such as RAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR), TR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	31	 COUP-TFs can thereby inhibit transcriptional activities of these receptors on both consensus and natural response elements (17, 20).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Four mechanisms have been proposed to address COUP-TF s ability to inhibit the transactivation function of other members of the steroid receptor superfamily.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	33	 First, COUP-TFs repress the hormone-dependent transactivation of target genes by VDR, TR, and RAR through direct competition for occupancy of their response elements (21, 22, 23).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Second, COUP-TFs heterodimerize with RXR to reduce the available concentration of RXR for heterodimerization with TR, VDR, RAR, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and thus indirectly interfere with these receptors to transactivate their target genes (21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Third, COUP-TFs can tether to DNA via LBD-LBD interactions with TR, RAR, and RXR to transrepress their activities (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Finally, COUP-TFs have been shown to repress basal and activator-dependent transcriptional activities of various promoters when their binding site is placed upstream or downstream of these promoters (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The silencing domain in COUP-TFs was localized to the C terminus of the putative LBD, which can be transferred to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Activators that can be repressed by COUP-TFs include acidic (Gal4-RII), glutamine-rich (Gal4-ftzQ), proline-rich (Gal4-CTF1P), and Ser/Thr-rich (Gal4-ZenST) transactivators (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Because COUP-TF can repress such a diverse group of transactivators, it is unlikely that COUP-TF s repression is through direct quenching of these transactivators or by interfering with their respective targets.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	40	 It is rather likely that COUP-TFs interact with a common target, a putative corepressor(s) that mediates their repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	41	To substantiate this hypothesis, we address two major questions in this paper; 1) Does COUP-TFI-mediated repression require corepressors? and 2) If it does, does COUP-TFI share corepressors with other receptors, such as TR and RAR? To answer these questions, we first examined whether cofactors are involved in COUP-TFI-mediated repression using either self-squelching or TR/COUP-TF-mediated mutual squelching experiments.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Next, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact with N-CoR or SMRT.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Finally, we examined whether N-CoR or SMRT can function as a corepressor in COUP-TFI-mediated repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Results from these experiments indicate that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI-mediated repression of target genes.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	45	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   COUP-TFI-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Requires Corepressor(s) The putative LBD of the COUP-TFI (amino acid 184 to 423) has been previously shown to contain a transcriptional repression domain.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	46	 To repress transcription, it is generally believed that the COUP-TFI interacts with the basal transcriptional machinery either directly or indirectly through other cofactor molecules.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	47	 To determine whether a cofactor(s) is required for this repressor activity, we carried out transfection experiments.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Transfection of a Gal4 DBD fused to the COUP-TFI (amino acid 184 to 423) cDNA, designated as Gal4-COUP-TFI, significantly repressed basal promoter activity of the 17 mer x 4-thymidine kinase promoter-linked luciferase reporter DNA as shown previously (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	49	 This repression activity can be reversed by the exogenously expressed LBD of COUP-TFI (184 to 423), which does not bind to the reporter construct, in a dose-dependent manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The observed release of repression cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effect of overexpression of COUP-TFI on Gal DNA-binding activity because overexpression of COUP-TFI had little effect on the basal promoter activity when cotransfected with the Gal4 DBD alone (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In contrast, COUP-TFI mutant, COUP-TFI35 (amino acid 184 to 388), which does not contain a repressor domain, cannot reverse Gal4-COUP-TFI-mediated repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Overexpression of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFI35 does not affect the basal promoter activity of Gal4 (data not shown).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These results clearly indicate that a limiting factor, termed corepressor(s), is required for the activity of COUP-TFI-mediated repression.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	86	 We asked whether these two corepressors can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	87	 First, we examined whether COUP-TFI can interact specifically with these authentic corepressors.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we confirmed that these corepressors can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	89	 4, A and B, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453 and fragments of SMRT encoding amino acids 565-1495 and 1192 to 1495 can interact with TRss in a hormone-dependent manner as previously described (10, 12, 14).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	90	 It should be pointed out that, to our surprise, a larger fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453, which contains a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 921-2453, cannot interact with TRss in a yeast two-hybrid assay.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Although the reason for this discrepancy is not clear at present, it is possible that the N-terminal repression domain of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 is very potent and overrides the activation function of Gal4 in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Similar to the TRss interaction study (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	118	 4B), the repression domains of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190 to 920 may interfere with the Gal4 activation domain function in a yeast two-hybrid assay; thus, a fragment of N-CoR encoding amino acids 190-2453 is not able to activate ss-galactosidase activity of the reporter.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, both N-CoR fragments encoding amino acids 190-2453 and 921-2453 were found to interact with COUP-TFI in an in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay because these in vitro interactions are presumably not influenced by the repressor function of N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Thus, a fragment of COUP-TFI encoding amino acids 56 to 423 can interact specifically with N-CoR in yeast and in vitro.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Since COUP-TFI has been shown to interact with TFIIB in vitro (29, 30), it is proposed that COUP-TFI can interact with TFIIB in a nonproductive manner to interfere with the basal transcription.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, many coactivators and corepressors have been identified as positive and negative cofactors in the transcriptional control of target genes by members of the steroid/TR superfamily (15, 31).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some of the cofactors may also be involved in gene-silencing mechanisms of orphan receptors, such as COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Initial evidence for mediators of nuclear receptor transactivation came from the finding that transiently transfecting increasing amounts of an ER-expressing plasmid into cultured cells results in a bell-shaped curve of transcriptional activation and was attributed to the squelching of a coactivator(s) by the excessive amounts of estrogen receptor (32).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	163	 By analogy with that, we demonstrated that a putative corepressor(s) may be involved in COUP-TFI-mediated basal repression because overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35 (which has lost its repression domain), can squelch the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Previously, we showed that a 15-amino-acid deletion from the C terminus (Gal4-COUP-TF15) had little effect on Gal4-COUP-TF activity, whereas a 25-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF25) or a 35-amino-acid (Gal4-COUP-TF35) deletion largely impaired its active repression function (27).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Therefore, these data suggested that the C-terminal border of the major active repression function of COUP-TF is located within amino acids 408 and 398, and it is this region that may interact with the corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In addition, the repressor domain of COUP-TFI may directly target the basal transcriptional machinery.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	167	To examine whether a corepressor(s) can be shared between TRss and COUP-TFI, squelching experiments were performed.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	168	 2, unliganded but not liganded TRss can squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The evidence that the TR mutant, TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A) (28), which does not interact with the putative corepressors, cannot squelch the basal repression of Gal4-COUP-TFI further supports the notion that common corepressors may be involved in basal repression between TRss and COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Furthermore, overexpression of COUP-TFI, but not COUP-TFI35, can squelch the basal repression activity of Gal4-TRss, also suggesting that common corepressors can function for both COUP-TFI and TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Theoretically, the target of transcriptional interference may be either a basal transcription factor(s) or a corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Transfection of COUP-TFI or TRss did not change the basal transcription of a PRE-tk-luciferase reporter lacking a proper response element (data not shown), suggesting that squelchers are unlikely to interfere directly with the function of any basal transcriptional machinery.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Therefore, the target(s) of interference between COUP-TF and TRss is likely to be one or more transcriptional corepressor protein(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	174	Because COUP-TFI can form homodimers by itself or form heterodimers with TRss (27), it is possible that the squelchers can form non-DNA-binding heterodimers with the repressors used in Figs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	175	 1, 2, and 3 (Gal4-COUP-TFI/COUP-TFI for Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	176	 2, and Gal4-TRss/COUP-TFI for Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	177	 If this is the case, inhibition of repressor activity may be due to inhibition of DNA binding rather than to squelching of a limiting corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	178	 However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	179	 First, both COUP-TFI and TRss have the ability to bind specifically to corepressors.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Second, a mutant form of TRss (TR168 to 456 (V174A/D177A)), which loses its ability to interact with corepressor but retains its intact dimerization domain, is not able to inhibit the repression activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Third, COUP-TF mutant (COUP-TFI35), which loses its ability in silencing, also loses its ability to squelch repressor activity of TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Finally and most importantly, we have demonstrated directly that both N-CoR and SMRT can mediate repressor activity of COUP-TFI (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	183	 6) and reverse the self-squelching activity (Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Therefore, inhibition of repression activity by squelchers in Figs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	185	 1, 2, and 3 indeed results from squelching of a limiting corepressor(s).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	186	Because squelching experiments showed that COUP-TFI may share a corepressor(s) with TRss, we examined protein-protein interaction between COUP-TFI and N-CoR or SMRT in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in in vitro GST pull-down assays as shown in Figs.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The amino acid 921-2453 fragment of N-CoR interacts with COUP-TFI.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This result is consistent with what has been observed in TR interaction studies (10, 33).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Interaction between COUP-TFI and the amino acid 190-2453 fragment of N-CoR was not detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay, but was detected in an in vitro GST pull-down assay.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This discrepancy is likely due to the potent repressor domain of the N-terminal portion of N-CoR, which suppresses the Gal4 activation function, resulting in interference with ss-galactosidase expression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Consistent with this interpretation, Seol et al.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	192	 (33) also recently demonstrated that the repressor domain of N-CoR strongly interferes with the mammalian two-hybrid assay to study the protein-protein interaction between N-CoR and TR or RAR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	193	 On the other hand, the amino acid 29 to 564 and amino acid 565-1289, but not amino acid 1192 to 1495, fragments of SMRT strongly interact with COUP-TF in yeast and in vitro assays.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Based on these data, we concluded that there are at least two COUP-TFI-interacting domains within the SMRT molecules.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The lack of interaction between COUP-TFI and SMRT (1192 to 1495) is surprising because this region interacts very strongly with TRss.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, different repressors may interact differentially with SMRT.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Finally, the corepressor-interacting region in COUP-TFI is localized in the extreme C terminus, which is quite different from the region of TR and RAR where hinge and N-terminal portions of LBD are involved in this interaction.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, repression function of COUP-TFs may act in a different way from that of TR and RAR (Fig.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In N-CoR, there are two repression domains (RD1 and RD2) as shown in the N-terminal region.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The most N-terminal region of SMRT (amino acids 1 to 483) contains four putative repeated motifs and it has 44% identity with N-CoR.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The acidic-basic motif () and the serine-glycine-rich domain (SG) in the central region are indicated.

0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	212	  In support of this observation, N-CoR has been shown to function as a corepressor for RevErb A (34).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, a region homologous to the CoR box in the RevErb A, which is necessary for TR and RAR to interact with N-CoR, is not required for RevErb A-mediated repression.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	214	 N-CoR contains two adjacent but distinct interaction domains, amino acids 2040 to 2239 and 2239 to 2296.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The former fragment of N-CoR strongly interacts with both TR and RevErb A; however, the latter fragment of N-CoR interacts weakly and preferentially with RevErb A.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Taken together, these data suggest that different nuclear receptors, utilizing different amino acid sequences, repress transcription by interacting with different region of N-CoR or SMRT as shown in Fig.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	217	Recently, an activator for COUP-TFII has been identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen, designated ORCA (orphan receptor coactivator) (35), and this factor is identical to a recently described ligand (p62) of tyrosine kinase- signaling molecule p56lck, suggesting that ORCA may link COUP-TFII and cell surface signal transduction pathways.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This integrating role may be similar to what is observed with cAMP response element-binding protein CBP and the related protein p300.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	219	 CBP plays a role in integrating cAMP second messenger and nuclear hormone receptor signal transduction pathways.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Of interest, ORCA/p62 shares a small region of homology with CBP, suggesting a potential similarity in their mechanism of action.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, based on their data, ORCA/p62 does not bind directly to COUP-TFII-binding sites and COUP-TFII/ORCA complex is not detected in gel retardation assays.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Therefore, it is possible that ORCA/p62 may function directly or indirectly by phosphorylating COUP-TFII or ORCA/p62 may overcome the function of a specific COUP-TFII-associated corepressor.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Because ORCA/p62 can convert COUP-TFII into a transcriptional activator in a ligand-independent manner in mammalian cells, it is possible that COUP-TFI can also be activated by a coactivator(s) in a ligand-independent manner.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Our preliminary data showed that overexpression of hSRC-1a (36), which is a general coactivator for members of steroid receptors, cannot relieve the repressor activity of Gal4-COUP-TFI in HeLa cells (data not shown).
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	225	In conclusion, we demonstrated that corepressors are involved in the mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated gene silencing, and that both N-CoR and SMRT can function as corepressors for COUP-TFI in mammalian cells.
0.2712022.9171235.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Therefore, orphan receptors such as COUP-TFI and RevErb A can function as a repressor in vivo by utilizing corepressors that are common for members of the TR and RAR subfamily.

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	5	Maturity onset diabetes of the young, subtype 1 (MODY1), is associated with defective glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	6	 MODY1 is caused by mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To understand better the MODY1 phenotype, we tested whether HNF4 was able to modulate directly the insulin gene promoter.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Transfection of cultured 293T cells with an HNF4 expression vector led to 10-fold activation of a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I gene promoter.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Computer analysis revealed a potential HNF4-binding site between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter; mutation of this sequence led to reduced ability of HNF4 to activate the promoter.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The ability of HNF4 to bind this sequence was confirmed using gel shift analysis.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In transfected INS-1 beta cells, mutation of either the HNF1 site or the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter led to 50-75% reduction in reporter gene activity; expression of dominant negative HNF4 led to significant reduction in the activity of wild type and both mutated promoters.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus, in addition to the previously described indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through elevated HNF1 levels, HNF4 also activates the insulin gene directly, through a previously unrecognized cis element.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	14	In adult mammals, the insulin gene is expressed exclusively in the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas (1-3).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This selectivity is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level through well defined promoter elements (4-6).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although a number of transcription factors have been defined that interact with the insulin promoter and activate it in synergistic fashion (7-10), the action of these factors alone is not sufficient to explain the remarkable degree of cell specificity observed in vivo (9).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	18	MODY1 is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by impaired glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the absence of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (11, 12).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	19	 This indicates that a beta cell defect is the primary cause of MODY and implies that MODY genes have a role in insulin production and/or secretion.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Consistent with this is the fact that four of the five known MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in distinct transcription factors expressed in pancreatic beta cells (13).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The striking MODY phenotype caused by such single gene disorders provides clear evidence of the important role of each of these transcription factors in beta cell function.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	22	MODY1 is caused by mutation in HNF4, a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor subfamily (14).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	23	 At least eight different mutations have been identified in MODY1 patients (15).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Four mutations result in truncated HNF4 proteins, of which two are nonsense mutations (14, 16), and two are frameshift mutations (17, 18).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The other four mutations are missense mutations that affect various domains of the HNF4 protein (19-22).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	26	MODY3 is caused by mutation in the HNF1 gene encoding a transcription factor of the homeodomain family (23).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Like HNF4, HNF1 is expressed in liver and beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In fact, HNF1 was shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4 in liver (24).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, a mutation in the HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 gene promoter produces a MODY phenotype (25).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Consistent with these observations, MODY1 and MODY3 show a similar clinical phenotype.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Recent studies (26) have shown that induction of dominant negative (DN) HNF1 in beta cells leads to alterations in expression of a number of beta cell genes including the insulin gene.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Because DN-HNF4 led to reduced activity of the Hnf1 promoter and reduced insulin mRNA levels (27), it was hypothesized that HNF4 increases insulin mRNA levels indirectly by increasing HNF1 levels, which in turn activate the promoter through binding to an HNF1 consensus sequence (28).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	33	Recently, however, strong evidence has been obtained indicating that this hypothesis may be an over-simplification and that the actual relationship between HNF4 and HNF1 may be more complex; it has been shown (29, 30) that P2, the major promoter of the Hnf4 gene in beta cells, is regulated by HNF1.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Therefore, activation of beta cell genes by HNF4 may involve more than a simple transcriptional regulatory cascade mediated through HNF1, as previously envisaged.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	35	In this study, we have examined this idea through a detailed analysis of the insulin gene promoter.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition to confirming that HNF4 activates insulin gene expression in an indirect fashion, through an HNF1-binding site, we have identified a novel cis element in the insulin gene promoter, which mediates direct activation of the promoter by HNF4 in beta cells.

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This cooperativity of HNF4 with PDX1 is probably responsible for the synergistic activation observed previously upon coexpression of HNF4 with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	172	Mechanism of Action of HNF4 in Beta Cells-- Expression of dominant negative HNF1 in the beta cell line INS-1 reduced the expression of several beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26), and has similar effects to that of dominant negative HNF4 (27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Furthermore, HNF4 is a transcription activator of HNF1 (24, 27), and mutations in HNF1 are responsible for MODY3 (23).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	174	 This raises the possibility that HNF4 may activate the insulin gene indirectly, through Hnf1 gene function.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In non-beta cells, the HNF4-dependent activation we observed (Fig.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	176	 1) may be mediated in part through HNF1, but the substantial reduction in the activation of promoter mutated in the HNF4-binding site (Fig.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	177	 3) indicates that a significant portion of the effect is mediated directly.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	178	To assess the significance of the HNF4 site in the insulin gene promoter in beta cells, and to test whether in beta cells HNF4 activates the insulin gene promoter directly or indirectly through HNF1, we used INS-1 DN-HNF4 26 cells, a derivative of INS-1 cells that contains a plasmid encoding doxycycline-inducible dominant negative HNF4 (27).

0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	202	Identification of HNF1 and HNF4 as the mutated genes responsible for MODY3 and MODY1, respectively, has prompted efforts to establish the precise role of these factors in health and disease.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Because the MODY phenotype involves a primary defect in beta cells, the defective function of these transcription factors must be manifested in these cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Indeed, expression of DN-HNF1 and DN-HNF4 leads to clear alterations in expression of key beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26, 27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Because previous studies have shown that HNF4 is an activator of HNF1 (24) and that MODY3 can be caused by mutation in an HNF4-binding site in the HNF1 promoter (25), it was proposed that the effect of HNF4 on the insulin gene promoter is indirect, mediated through activation of HNF1 (27).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	206	In this report, we have examined the above hypothesis.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells led to reduced activity of both wild type insulin gene promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1-binding site, strongly suggesting the presence of an HNF4-binding site elsewhere in the promoter region.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Indeed, we identified such a sequence between nucleotides 57 and 69 of the promoter, and we were able to show that it is capable of binding HNF4 in vitro.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We further showed that this site is essential for full activation of the promoter in beta cells and for efficient HNF4-dependent activation in non-beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Expression of DN-HNF4 in beta cells also led to reduced activity of a promoter construct bearing mutations in the HNF4 site.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The data therefore indicate that in addition to the previously recognized indirect action of HNF4 on insulin gene expression mediated through HNF1, there is also a direct action mediated through binding to the novel HNF4 consensus sequence in the promoter.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	212	These results are consistent with recent reports (29, 30) indicating that the epistatic relationship between HNF4 and HNF1 in beta cells is more complex than previously appreciated and may differ from that in liver.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It has been shown that the Hnf4 promoter contains an upstream beta cell-specific promoter whose activity is regulated by HNF1.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This promoter also contains a binding site for PDX1, mutations in which strongly correlate with the diabetic phenotype in a MODY family (30).
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Taken together, the data are consistent with the idea that HNF1, HNF4, and PDX1 participate in a complex autoregulatory transcriptional network that controls many of the functional properties of developing and mature beta cells.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Of central importance in this regard is the insulin gene, whose expression is modulated by all three factors.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Interestingly, we have observed synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter by HNF4 and PDX1, which have adjacent binding sites in this promoter, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the transcriptional control network.
0.21709998.11994285.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The current results indicating that HNF4 activates the insulin gene through both direct and indirect actions will permit a more detailed understanding of the MODY phenotype.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	4	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleotropic polypeptide that can function as a morphogen, motogen, mitogen, angiogen, carcinogen, and tumor suppressor, depending on the target cell and tissue.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Previous studies from our laboratory using transgenic mice have shown that HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and that the upstream regulatory elements are crucial for the control of HGF gene transcription.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In the present study, we have identified and characterized one of these elements as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR)-responsive element.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This regulatory element was localized at 246 to 233 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of the HGF gene promoter having the sequence GGGCCAGGTGACCT.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Gel mobility shift and supershift assays demonstrated that this cis-acting element strongly binds to the PPAR isoforms as well as to chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutational analysis and gel mobility band shift assays indicated that the binding site is an inverted repeat of the AGGTCA motif with two spacers (inverted repeat 2 configuration) and that the two spacers are important for PPAR binding.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This binding site overlaps with functional binding sites for activating protein-2, nuclear factor 1, and upstream stimulatory factor, and together, they constitute a multifunctional composite binding site through which these different transcription factors exert their regulatory effects on HGF promoter activity.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Functional assays revealed that PPAR, with its ligand, 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, strongly stimulates HGF promoter activity.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	12	 On the other hand, nuclear factor 1, activating protein-2, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor transcription factors repress the stimulatory action of PPAR by competing with PPAR for their overlapping binding sites.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Furthermore, for the first time, our studies demonstrate that the PPAR ligand, 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, induces endogenous HGF mRNA and protein expression in fibroblasts in culture.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In vivo, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in response to cell loss to facilitate tissue regeneration.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For example, HGF mRNA increases in the liver as well as in distal organs such as lung and spleen after loss of hepatic tissue induced by partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin treatment.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Similarly, after injury to the lung or kidney (by toxins or by surgical procedures such as unilateral pneumonectomy or nephrectomy, respectively), HGF gene expression is induced in these organs to promote their regeneration (13, 14).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	23	Several studies have shown that HGF gene expression is controlled tightly at the transcriptional level.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In vivo analyses of HGF gene promoter regulation in transgenic mice (15) as well as in in vitro transient transfection studies have shown that important regulatory element(s) exist in the proximal promoter region of the HGF gene (16-20).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In recent studies, we have partially characterized this region and revealed that it harbors a composite element located at position 260 to 230 bp from the transcriptional start site.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	85	Identification of a Binding Site for PPAR Transcription Factor in the HGF Gene Promoter-- Our recent studies of the HGF promoter revealed that the proximal promoter region at position 260 to 230 is a multifunctional composite site to which different transcription factors such as NF1, USF, and AP2 can bind and regulate HGF gene transcription (21, 22).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	86	 During those studies, we found that distinct factor(s) also specifically bind to this element that are not related to the NF1, USF, or AP2 families (21).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Within this 30-bp region (260 to 230) of the promoter, we identified RGGTCA hexanucleotide motifs, which are potential binding sites for the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (23, 28).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	88	 To further characterize the composite binding site and its cognate transcription factors, we radiolabeled the HGF promoter composite element (260 to 230) with 32P and used this oligonucleotide as a probe to perform gel mobility band shift assays.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In these experiments, nuclear protein extracts from 3T3-L1 and NIH3T3 fibroblast cell lines were used.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	90	 1, this DNA element forms several specific complexes, of which the major complex(es) (shown by a large arrow head) are efficiently abrogated by an excess amount of binding site for NF1 (compare lane 2 with lane 4 and lane 7 with lane 9, respectively).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The remaining two complexes, which we have labeled in the figure as C1 and C2, formed by nuclear protein extract from NIH3T3 cells, are abolished by an excess amount of USF and nuclear hormone binding sites (RXRE), respectively (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We have previously shown by super shift assays that the major complex(es) C contain NF1 isoform(s) and that the C1 complex is composed of USF1 and USF2 isoforms (21).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	93	 1, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts do not have detectable C1 and only form the C2 complex, which is totally abrogated by RXRE (DR1, direct AGGTCA repeat with one spacing) (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Thus, these results extend our previous observation and demonstrate that the complex C2 may contain nuclear hormone receptor(s), because it can be competed by a binding site having an AGGTCA motif (please see Ref.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	95	 To better define the binding site for complex C2, several mutant versions of the promoter element were synthesized (see Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	96	 2E for nucleotide sequences) and used as competitors in electrophoretic mobility band shift assays using NF1-depleted 3T3-L1 nuclear protein extracts.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	97	 2A, deletion of up to 11 base pairs from the 5' region did not have a notable effect on the binding activity (because these oligonucleotides still effectively competed with the radiolabeled wild-type probe; Fig.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, when six nucleotides from the 3' region were truncated, the resulting oligonucleotide totally lost its competitive ability (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	100	 These results revealed that the binding site for C2 should be between 249 and 230.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Close examination of the promoter element (249 to 230) indicated that it harbors a potential RGGTCA inverted repetitive sequence separated by two nucleotides (IR2) (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The AGGTCA site is known as the perfect nuclear hormone binding half-site, although in almost every case, it is a variation of this sequence known as imperfect motif (28).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Indeed, comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this 31-base pair element among the mouse, rat, and human HGF promoters revealed perfect conservation of this site (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	104	 To define the binding site for the C2 complex in more detail, several mutated oligonucleotides were synthesized and used in gel shift competition assays, as above, using fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Mutations in the AGGTCA half-site in the 3' region abolished the binding capability (mutant oligonucleotides named M4 and M5 in which AGGTCA is mutated to AGGGAC and CTTTCA, respectively) (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Conservative mutations in the 5'-half-site RGGTCA motif (GGGCCA to AAGCCA or GGGAAA and also mutations in the two spacers (GG to AT) (oligonucleotides named M1, M2, and M3, respectively)) did not dramatically affect binding, because these oligonucleotides still competed with the labeled probe for binding (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, mutation in the 5'-half-site that totally changes the hexanucleotide from GGGCCA to TTTGGC completely abolished its binding activity (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	108	 To define the role of the two spacers in the IR2 configuration, we generated additional mutant oligonucleotides as indicated in Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	109	 2E and used them as competitors.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	110	 2D, deleting of one or both spacer nucleotides (GG) dramatically reduced the binding activity (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	111	 On the other hand, mutating the two putative spacers from GG to TT did not affect the binding activity (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	112	 These results implied that the RGGTCA half-sites and the two-spacer configuration are important for binding of complex C2 to this region.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	113	 As mentioned above, it is well known that the RGGTCA is the binding half-site for some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (23, 28).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Therefore, several antibodies against the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were used to identify complex C2 by supershift assays using fibroblast nuclear extract; these antibodies were against retinoic acid receptor, OR-1, thyroid hormone receptor, COUP-TF, vitamin D receptor, and nerve growth factor-induced B.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	115	 None of these antibodies reacted with the C2 complex (data not shown).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Further analysis using additional antibodies against other nuclear receptors revealed that anti-PPAR antibody reacted with and totally supershifted complex C2 formed by the fibroblast nuclear extracts (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Neither anti-RXR antibody nor an unrelated antibody (anti-Sp1; see Fig.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In fact, we show that the HGF PPAR element binds to both PPAR and RXR using liver nuclear protein extract, which is presumably rich in RXR (see below).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	162	 To find out whether RXR can regulate the HGF gene promoter through binding to this IR2 element as a partner of PPAR, RXR expression vector and its ligand, 9-cis-RA, were used in cotransfection CAT assay experiments using a fibroblast cell line.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The strongest induction of the promoter was achieved by cotransfection of PPAR and RXR expression vectors in the presence of 15-deoxy-PGJ2 (the PPAR ligand) and 9-cis-RA (the RXR ligand) (Fig.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In the liver, HGF is expressed in the non-parenchymal mesenchymal cells (especially stellate cells, also known as the Ito cells or lipocytes because they store lipids and vitamin A).

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	185	 A surprising finding in these experiments was that this element could also strongly bind to COUP-TF, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, which also binds to the RGGTCA motif (see Fig.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Of course, it is known that COUP-TF also forms homodimers; thus, it is likely that the C2 complex in the nuclear extract of liver cells is mainly composed of COUP-TF homodimer as well as COUP-TF and PPAR heterodimers.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	189	 On the other hand, the C2 complex produced by fibroblast nuclear extracts lacks any COUP-TF, because it did not react with anti-COUP-TF (data not shown; also see Fig.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Additionally, published data demonstrate that COUP-TF can form heterodimers with RXR in solution in the absence of their binding site.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In this manner, COUP-TF sequesters RXR, preventing PPAR/RXR heterodimer formation and the stimulatory function of PPAR/RXR.

0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	257	In this study, we demonstrated that the nuclear receptors PPAR and COUP-TF bind to a composite regulatory element in the HGF upstream promoter region located at 246 to 233 bp from the transcription start site.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This binding site also overlaps/harbors functional binding sites for NF1, AP2, and the USF family of transcription factors (21, 22), and together, they constitute a multifunctional composite site to which these various transcription factors can bind and regulate the activity of the HGF promoter.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Cotransfection assays showed that PPAR1, with its partner, RXR, in the presence of their corresponding ligands, 15-deoxy PGJ2 and 9-cis-RA, respectively, strongly stimulated HGF promoter activity.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	260	 NF1, AP2, and COUP-TFI suppressed the stimulatory function of PPAR by competing for their individual binding sites.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Moreover, we demonstrated that 15-deoxy-PGJ2, the ligand of PPAR, induces the expression of the endogenous HGF gene at the mRNA and protein levels in cultured fibroblasts.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	262	PPAR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that includes receptors for the steroid, thyroid, and retinoid hormones (23, 28).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	263	 It is known that there are three related but quite distinct PPAR proteins: PPAR, PPAR, and PPAR.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Two forms of PPAR, 1 and 2, exist as products of alternative promoter usage (29, 30).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Like other members of this superfamily, PPAR contains a central DNA binding domain that binds to a cis-acting element in the promoter of its target genes.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Most of the PPAR response elements described are composed of a directly repeating core site separated by one nucleotide (RGGTCA-N-RGGTCA) called DR1 (24, 28).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Interestingly, the PPAR response element in the HGF promoter region is an inverted repeating core site separated by two nucleotides (GGGCCA-NN-TGACCT) that we have called IR2.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Published data indicate that PPAR heterodimerizes with RXR and that the PAR/RXR heterodimer binds to its response element and activates its target genes (23, 31).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Our results indicated that the IR2 site in the HGF gene promoter also binds to RXR, though very weakly.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Generally, RXR is said to be a silent partner.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Nonetheless, there are several examples in which RXR can be an active partner (31).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Similarly, both RXR and PPAR in the RXR/PPAR heterodimers bound to the IR2 element in HGF gene promoter region are independently responsive and are synergistically activated in the presence of both ligands, 15-deoxy PGJ2 and 9-cis-RA.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	273	PPAR plays an essential role in cell growth and differentiation as well as in oncogenesis.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Controversies exist on whether PPAR acts as a tumor promoter or tumor suppressor.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	275	 For example, ligand activation of PPAR causes most, but not all, colon cancer cell lines to undergo a differentiating response and reverse their malignant phenotype (32).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Paradoxically, ligand activation of PPAR in min mice, an animal model for familial adenomatous polyposis, seemed to cause increased polyposis (33, 34).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	277	 It is demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in PPAR are also associated with human colon cancer (35).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	278	 It is not clear whether this association between colon cancer and PPAR is involved in HGF expression in colon cancer tissue, because HGF expression is also aberrant in colon cancer tissues.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Additionally, HGF can also function paradoxically as a tumor suppressor and tumor promoter in different settings (2, 3).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Little is known about the target genes activated by PPAR; our present findings shed significant light on the matter in the sense that HGF may mediate some of the functions of PPAR in tissue growth and differentiation and in cancer.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	281	Like HGF, PPAR is expressed in various tissues, but predominantly in the mesenchymal cells, namely adipocytes/fibroblasts (36).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Interestingly, in the liver, HGF is expressed in a specialized fibroblastic cell type called Ito cells, which are also known as lipocytes (because they store lipids and vitamin A).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Like HGF, PPAR is also expressed in the placenta, and its deficiency leads to placental dysfunction and death by E10 (37).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	284	 A qualitatively similar placental abnormality has been seen in RXR knockout mice, suggesting that these phenotypes may be due to impaired PPAR-mediated signaling in the placenta (37).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Interestingly, HGF knockout mice revealed that homozygous HGF mutant embryos have severely impaired placentas with markedly reduced numbers of labyrinthine trophoblast cells, and the embryos die before birth by E15 (6, 7).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Combining these data, it seems possible that HGF may be one of the mediators of the growth regulatory action of PPAR/RXR.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	287	So far, we have identified several functional regulatory elements and their binding transcription factors that act on the HGF gene promoter (Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Based on the current findings and previous published results, we believe that transcriptional regulation of the HGF gene is very complex and is dependent on the combination of all of these transcription factors, including COUP-TF, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, Sp1, estrogen receptor, NF1, AP2, USF, and PPAR (15-22).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	289	 CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein , SP1, estrogen receptor, USF, and PPAR are positive regulators.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	290	 COUP-TF, AP2, and NF1 are mainly negative regulators.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	291	 COUP-TFs can compete with both estrogen receptor and PPAR for their respective binding sites and suppress the stimulatory functions of both estrogen receptor and PPAR in the presence of their own ligands (estrogen and 15-deoxy PGJ2, respectively).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This result implies that COUP-TFs and the NF1 family play an important role in regulation of HGF gene expression.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	293	 As mentioned above, PPAR and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein  are believed to play an important role in adipocyte differentiation (38).
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Interestingly, we noted that in the 3T3-L1 fibroblasts that differentiate into adipocytes when placed in differentiation medium, a marked increase in PPAR and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein  binding to the HGF promoter elements occurred and is depicted in Fig.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	295	 The increase in the binding activity correlated well with an increase in HGF and HGF receptor (Met) expression in these cells, implying that the HGF/Met signaling system may have a role in adipocyte differentiation.
0.25199053.11292834.html.plaintext.txt	296	 A summary of the positive and negative regulators of the HGF gene promoter that we have identified and characterized thus far is presented in Fig.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	4	Retinoids are therapeutically effective in the treatment of various cancers, and some of the therapeutic action of retinoids can be ascribed to their potent inhibition of AP-1 activity that regulates transcription of genes associated with cell growth.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We recently reported that the expression of orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) plays a role in mediating the growth inhibitory effect of trans-retinoic acid (trans-RA) in cancer cells.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which COUP-TF regulates trans-RA activity, we evaluated the effect of COUP-TF on antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between COUP-TF expression and the ability of trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in various cancer cell lines.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In transient transfection assay, expression of COUP-TF strongly inhibited tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 transactivation activity and transactivation of c-Jun/c-Fos in both a trans-RA-dependent and -independent manner.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In vitro studies demonstrated that the addition of COUP-TF inhibited c-Jun DNA binding through a direct protein-protein interaction that is mediated by the DNA binding domain of COUP-TF and the leucine zipper of c-Jun.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells restored the ability of trans-RA to inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced c-Jun expression.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The effect of COUP-TF in enhancing the trans-RA-induced antagonism of AP-1 activity required expression of retinoic acid receptors (RARs), since stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative HT-1376 bladder cancer cells, which do not express RAR and RAR, failed to restore trans-RA-induced AP-1 repression.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus, COUP-TF, through its physical interaction with AP-1, promotes anticancer effects of retinoids by potentiating their anti-AP-1 activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	14	Retinoids, the natural and synthetic vitamin A analogs, exert profound effects on many biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation (1, 2), and are recognized as promising agents for the prevention and treatment of various cancers.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by two nuclear receptor classes, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)1 and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (3-5).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Both are encoded by three different genes (, , and ) and function as ligand-inducible transcription factors in vivo mainly as RXR/RAR heterodimers.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	17	 trans-Retinoic acid (trans-RA) binds RARs, whereas 9-cis-RA binds both RARs and RXRs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Binding of retinoids to their receptors induces receptor conformational changes that switch on transcription of genes containing RA response elements (RAREs) (3-5).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In addition to their positive regulation of RARE-containing genes, retinoid receptors, in response to their ligands, can inhibit effects induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and the transcriptional activity of the proto-oncogenes c-Jun and c-Fos (6), which are components of the AP-1 complex, which often has a role in cancer cell proliferation (7).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The activation of AP-1-responsive genes by TPA or c-Jun/c-Fos through TPA response elements (TREs) is repressed by retinoid receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (8-10).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Conversely, AP-1 represses transactivation of retinoid receptors (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This mutual antagonism appears to play a critical role in regulating cell growth and differentiation (6).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	23	 For example, overexpression of c-Jun conferred retinoid resistance to breast cancer cells (11), while overexpression of retinoid receptors enabled trans-RA to inhibit AP-1 activity in ovarian cancer cells and their growth (12).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The functional interaction between AP-1 and retinoid receptors is also observed for other nuclear receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor (13-16), thyroid hormone receptor (17), vitamin D receptor, estrogen receptor (18, 19), and androgen receptor (AR) (18).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	25	The anti-AP-1 activities shown by liganded retinoid receptors appear to contribute significantly to the therapeutic efficacy of retinoids against hyperproliferative diseases (6).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Transcription of various AP-1-responsive genes, such as collagenase and stromelysin, which have roles in tumor progression and invasiveness (20), is inhibited by retinoids (8-10) and has been reported to contribute to their reversal of human bronchial epithelial squamous differentiation (21).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Retinyl methyl ether, which effectively prevents mammary cancer in animals, strongly suppressed AP-1 activity in breast cancer cell (22).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Interestingly, RAR, a negative regulator of cancer cell growth (23), potently inhibits AP-1 activity and collagenase expression in both breast and lung cancer cells (24).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recent studies demonstrate that retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity but antagonize RAR transactivation on RAREs inhibited the growth of many different types of cancer cells (25-27).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Anti-AP-1 retinoids inhibited squamous differentiation of human bronchial epithelial cells (21), TPA-induced transformation and the clonal growth of the promotion-sensitive JB6 mouse epidermal cell line (28), and papilloma formation in animals (29).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids contributes to their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects, presumably by blocking the processes of tumor promotion and cell transformation.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	32	The mechanism by which retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity remains largely unclear.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Unlike the effect of retinoid receptors on RAREs, inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoid receptors is independent of retinoid receptor-RARE interaction (8-10).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Previous studies suggested several possible mechanisms for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid receptors.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	35	 First, retinoid receptors are reported to physically interact with c-Jun and/or c-Fos (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This interaction results in the mutual inhibition of their DNA binding and transactivation functions and could explain the cross-talk occurring between AP-1 and retinoid signaling.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	37	 However, a large excess of either retinoid receptor protein or c-Jun and c-Fos proteins was required to inhibit in vitro binding to the TRE or RARE, respectively (8, 9).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Because the in vivo footprint assay for glucocorticoid receptor and AP-1 interaction did not reveal any effect on DNA binding (30), whether RAR and AP-1 directly interact in vivo remains to be established.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Subsequently, it was suggested that blocking activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that activates AP-1 might be responsible for AP-1 inhibition by retinoid and other nuclear receptors (31).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Although this mechanism may explain how retinoids inhibit AP-1 activity under some conditions, it does not address how mutual inhibition occurs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Recent results suggest that the molecular basis of receptor-mediated inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activation might be due to competition for a common coactivator, such as the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP), which is required for transcriptional activation by both the AP-1 complex and RARs (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, a domain of RAR capable of inhibiting AP-1 activity, such as the DNA-binding domain (33), does not interact with CBP (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The development of retinoids that specifically inhibit AP-1 activity without transactivating RARs (25, 26) also argues against the involvement of RAR coactivators in RARs-AP-1 cross-talk.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, the availability of CBP is unlikely to be the sole modulator of RAR and AP-1-signaling pathways, and other adapter proteins may be involved in the antagonism of AP-1 activity by RARs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	45	Recent studies demonstrate that orphan receptor COUP-TF is involved in regulation retinoid responses (34, 35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	46	 COUP-TF is encoded by two distinct genes, COUP-TFI (EAR-3) (36, 37) and COUP-TFII (ARP-1) (38).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Both show exceptional homology and overlapping expression patterns, suggesting their redundant functions (39).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	48	 COUP-TF can modulate retinoid responses through either its high affinity binding to various RAREs or its heterodimerization with RXR (40-43).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	49	 We previously reported that COUP-TF expression was required for cancer cell growth inhibition by trans-RA (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We further demonstrated that the effect of COUP-TF is partly due to its induction of RAR that mediates growth inhibition by retinoids in various cancer cells (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	51	To further understand how COUP-TF is involved in the regulation of trans-RA activity in cancer cells, we investigated the effect of COUP-TF on antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Our data demonstrate that COUP-TF expression in various cancer cell lines correlated with the ability of trans-RA to suppress AP-1 transcriptional activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In addition, we found that COUP-TF effectively suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity by interacting with c-Jun to cause loss of c-Jun DNA binding.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This interaction required COUP-TF DNA-binding domain and the c-Jun leucine-zipper domain.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Although AP-1 inhibition by COUP-TF did not require trans-RA, COUP-TF strongly potentiated the AP-1 antagonism by trans-RA when RARs were expressed.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Our results demonstrate that interaction between COUP-TF and AP-1 is involved in regulating anti-AP-1 activity of retinoids in cancer cells and suggest that COUP-TF plays a role in the cross-talk between retinoid and AP-1 signalings.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Since inhibition of AP-1 activity by retinoids is known to contribute to their anticancer effects, we studied whether COUP-TF expression was involved in the process.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The effect of trans-RA on inhibiting AP-1 activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	95	 1A) was evaluated in COUP-TF-positive T-47D and ZR-75-1 breast cancer and Calu-6 lung cancer cell lines and in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer, H292 lung cancer, and HT-1376 bladder cancer cell lines (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	96	 AP-1 activity induced by TPA was determined by transient transfection using the reporter 73Col-CAT, which contains a TRE that binds AP-1 (8).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	97	 TPA-induced reporter activity was strongly inhibited in a trans-RA-dependent manner in the COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cell lines.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Therefore, we transiently transfected the COUP-TF expression vector and the 73Col-CAT reporter into the COUP-TF-negative cell lines, in which trans-RA did not inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Upon COUP-TF transfection, trans-RA inhibited TPA-induced reporter activity in both MDA-MB231 and H292 cells in a COUP-TF concentration-dependent manner.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Activation of collagenase promoter by TPA occurs mainly through induction of AP-1 activity that activates the TRE in the promoter (7).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	127	 We therefore examined whether COUP-TF expression also interfered with transactivation activity of c-Jun homodimer and c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Cotransfection of 73Col-CAT with the c-Jun expression vector into HeLa cells led to about 5-fold induction of reporter expression (Fig.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	132	 To determine that inhibition of collagenase promoter activity by COUP-TF was mediated by the TRE, we evaluated how COUP-TFI affected the TRE-tk-CAT reporter, which has a TRE sequence fused to the thymidine kinase promoter (Fig.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	153	 The addition of COUP-TF protein did not show any new complex formed with the collagenase promoter, indicating that the inhibitory effect of COUP-TF is not due to its direct binding to the collagenase promoter.

0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	256	Retinoids are effective growth inhibitors of cancer cells.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Inhibition of AP-1 activity has been proposed as one mechanism by which retinoids exert their anticancer effects (6).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Despite extensive studies in the last few years, how retinoids specifically antagonize AP-1 activity remains largely unknown.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Here, we provide evidence that COUP-TF is involved in regulating the antagonism of AP-1 transactivational activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	260	 COUP-TF, by physically interacting with c-Jun, inhibits AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation and is required for efficient inhibition of AP-1 activity by liganded RARs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Our results suggest that COUP-TF plays a role in the cross-talk between retinoid and AP-1 signaling pathways.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	262	We recently reported that the expression of COUP-TF positively correlates with the inhibition of the growth of various cancer cell lines by trans-RA and that COUP-TF is underexpressed in many trans-RA-resistant cancer cell lines (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Stable expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative cancer cells restores their sensitivity to trans-RA, demonstrating that COUP-TF can mediate anticancer effects of trans-RA (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	264	 By studying anti-AP-1 activity of trans-RA in various cancer cell lines, we found a close correlation between COUP-TF expression and the anti-AP-1 activity of trans-RA (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In COUP-TF-positive ZR-75-1, T-47D, and Calu-6 cancer cell lines (35), trans-RA strongly inhibited the ability of TPA to activate transcription of the collagenase promoter, whereas in COUP-TF-negative MDA-MB231, H292, and HT-1376 cell lines, trans-RA failed to suppress TPA activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that trans-RA effectively inhibited AP-1 activity in ZR-75-1 and T-47D cells but not in MDA-MB231 cells (49).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The requirement of COUP-TF in trans-RA-mediated AP-1 inhibition was further demonstrated by our findings that transient expression of COUP-TF in COUP-TF-negative cells (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	268	 1B) restored the ability of trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced AP-1 transactivation and that stable expression of COUP-TF in MBA-MB231 cells enabled trans-RA to inhibit TPA-induced c-Jun expression (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	269	We have reported that COUP-TF expression contributes to growth inhibition by trans-RA in cancer cells because COUP-TF on binding to the RAR promoter induces RAR expression (35).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	270	 RAR is reported to be a potent AP-1 inhibitor (24), suggesting that COUP-TF-induced RAR probably contributes to the inhibition of AP-1 activity (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Our observations that COUP-TF can effectively interact with c-Jun in vitro (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	272	 3 and 4) and inhibit AP-1 transcriptional activity on transient transfection (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	273	 2) also suggest that COUP-TF is directly involved in antagonizing AP-1 activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	274	Inhibition of AP-1 activity appears to be a common characteristic of nuclear receptors, as has been demonstrated for the progesterone, estrogen, androgen, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoid, and retinoid receptors, which can functionally interact with the AP-1 complex.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	275	 This study reveals that the orphan receptor COUP-TF behaves similarly.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The molecular basis of the interaction between nuclear receptors and AP-1 pathways remains largely unknown.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Models proposed include direct protein-protein interaction (8, 9, 13-15), inhibition of Jun N-terminal kinase activity (31), and competition for CBP (32).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Our results of GST pull-down assays (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	279	 4B and 5) and mutation analysis (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	280	 4 and 5) support the first model.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The requirement for the COUP-TF DBD for c-Jun binding is similar to observations that the DBDs of glucocorticoid receptor (14, 15) and RAR (47) are essential for their interaction with AP-1.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding study showed that COUP-TF is a more effective inhibitor of AP-1 binding than RAR (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	283	 3) on the basis of the levels of each receptor to exert this effect.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	284	In contrast to inhibition of AP-1 activity by other receptors that require their respective ligands, COUP-TF effectively inhibited AP-1 transactivation in the absence of any ligand (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Such a ligand-independent inhibition of AP-1 activity may restrict expression levels of AP-1-responsive genes in cancer cells (Figs.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Interestingly, we observed that COUP-TF expression potentiates antagonism of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	287	 However, regulation of trans-RA activity by COUP-TF appears to require RAR or RAR, because transiently transfected COUP-TF was unable to confer anti-AP-1 activity to trans-RA in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR or - (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	288	 8B) unless RAR was cotransfected.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In addition, stable expression of COUP-TF restored trans-RA-induced anti-AP-1 activity in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	290	 6) having RARs (48) but not in HT-1376 cells lacking RAR and - (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Thus, expression of both RAR/ and COUP-TF is required for optimal inhibition of AP-1 activity by trans-RA.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	292	Although we do not fully understand how COUP-TF and RAR coexpression maximizes inhibition of AP-1 activity by trans-RA, our finding of physical interaction between COUP-TF and RAR (35, 50) suggests its involvement in this process.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Based on our observation that COUP-TF more effectively inhibits c-Jun binding to DNA than RAR (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	294	 3), it is tempting to speculate that COUP-TF, with its ability to interact with both RAR (35, 50) and c-Jun (Fig.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	295	 3), may function as a bridging factor to mediate RAR/AP-1 interaction.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	296	 In this model, the COUP-TF/RAR heterodimer would strongly interact with AP-1 in the presence of trans-RA to inhibit the DNA binding of AP-1 and its transactivation.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Similarly, COUP-TF, by interacting with c-Jun, might also potentiate the inhibition of RAR/ transactivation by AP-1.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Unfortunately, perhaps due to rapid formation of the COUP-TF homodimer after COUP-TF expression in vitro (40, 51), we were unsuccessful in demonstrating the interaction between RAR/COUP-TF heterodimer and c-Jun in gel shift or GST pull-down assays (data not shown).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Another possible mechanism for inhibiting AP-1 transactivation by COUP-TF may involve its recruiting of a transcriptional corepressor.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	300	 COUP-TF has been widely considered as a potent negative transcriptional regulator (40-43) due to its effective interaction with corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (52).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The interaction between COUP-TF and both RAR and AP-1 may recruit transcriptional corepressors to the complex, thereby enhancing the mutual repression of AP-1 and RAR transcriptional activity.
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Interestingly, COUP-TF interacts with a variety of nuclear receptors, including RXR (41), TR (40, 50), estrogen receptor (53, 54), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (55).
0.37651846.11934895.html.plaintext.txt	303	 It remains to be determined whether and how COUP-TF is involved in modulating the anti-AP-1 activity by their ligands.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	3	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	4	 However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 expression in the central nervous system are poorly understood.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have recently reported that the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here, our results show that COUP-TF stimulates HIV-1 transcription in primary cultured human microglial cells, the primary target for HIV-1 infection in brain.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Run-on assays indicated that COUP-TF acts on the initiation step of transcription.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Results from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry analysis further revealed the importance of this factor by demonstrating that overexpression of COUP-TF leads to initiation of viral replication in primary HIV-infected human microglia.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In addition, COUP-TF is able to physically interact and cooperate with the viral transactivator Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The combination of COUP-TF and Tat leads to NF-B- and Sp1-independent enhanced transcriptional stimulation.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In vitro binding studies showed that COUP-TF interacts with Tat through amino acids within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Amino acids 48-72 in the basic and C-terminal regions of Tat are required for the binding of Tat to COUP-TF.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results suggest that COUP-TF is an essential transcription factor involved in HIV-1 expression in microglia and reveal a novel interplay of Tat and COUP-TF during regulation of viral expression.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	15	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 infects the central nervous system (CNS) and leads to a wide range of neurological complications (1, 2).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and perhaps neurons are capable of harboring a restricted infection with HIV-1 (3-5), the CNS-resident macrophages or microglial cells (6) are the primary target of HIV-1 infection in brain (7-10).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HIV-1 infection is established in the CNS by viruses present early in infection (11).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Macrophage-tropic isolates infect microglial cells more efficiently than do lymphotropic isolates (12).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We have therefore performed our studies with both a macrophage-tropic and a lymphotropic strain.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	20	The regulation of HIV-1 gene expression is governed by interactions of viral and host cell transcription factors with the long terminal repeat (LTR) region (for review, see Refs.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Recent studies have focused on cellular factors that regulate HIV-1 expression in CNS cells (15-18).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Our previous studies have highlighted the importance of members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor family in the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We have shown that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF/Ear3 (19) function as a potent HIV-1 transcriptional activator in different human brain cell lines.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Whereas in oligodendrocytes, COUP-TF acts by direct interaction with the nuclear receptor-responsive element located in the 352/320 LTR region (17), in microglial cells, COUP-TF enhances transcription via the minimal 68/+29 LTR region by direct association with the Sp1 protein (18).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	25	These transcription factors activate LTR-driven transcription in the immediate-early phase of HIV infection, in which viral transcription proceeds at a low rate through dependence solely on cellular transcription factors.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This leads to the early phase, in which a dramatic increase in transcription results from the accumulation of the primary transactive viral protein Tat (14, 20).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A number of studies have shown that Tat increases the rate of transcription initiation, elongation and translation of TAR-containing mRNAs.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The ability of Tat to function as a transcriptional activator is mediated by the interaction with a number of different cellular proteins (for review, see Ref.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The general transcription factors TBP/TFIID (21) and TFIIH (22) and the elongation factors TAK/PTEFb (23, 24) and cyclin T (25) associate with Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In addition, transcriptional activation by Tat requires the concerted action of Tat and factors binding to the Sp1 and B LTR region.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The importance of the Sp1 factor for Tat-mediated transactivation is well established (26, 27); a direct interaction occurs between Sp1 and amino acids 30-72 of Tat during transactivation (26, 28, 29).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Specific NF-B subunits also act in concert with Tat to enhance LTR-driven transcription (30, 31).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Moreover, the thyroid hormone receptor T3R, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, was found to interact with Tat through amino acids located in the DNA-binding domain of T3R and through amino acids 49-72 in the basic and C-terminal region of Tat (32).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These data explain why mutations within the LTR sequence decrease or abolish Tat-mediated activation (33, 34).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Interestingly, TAR-independent Tat transactivation has also been described, in the presence of an intact NF-B element (35, 36).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	36	In this report, we have investigated the functional effect of the nuclear receptor COUP-TF on HIV-1 gene expression in primary cultured human microglial cells.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Our results reveal the importance of COUP-TF as an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in primary microglia.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In addition, we provide evidence for a novel functional and physical interaction between COUP-TF and Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This interaction leads to enhanced synergistic NF-B and Sp1-independent transactivation of the LTR.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Our data suggest a model of an alternative pathway for Tat transactivation in microglia that is independent of both NF-B and Sp1, through direct interactions of Tat with the nuclear receptor COUP-TF.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Because we also detected endogenous COUP-TF in primary cultures of microglial cells (results not shown), it appeared essential to examine how COUP-TF regulates HIV-1 gene transcription and viral replication in these cells.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Transfection experiments were performed with a LTR-CAT reporter vector in primary cultures of microglial cells containing the CAT gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR region.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	123	 When cells were cultured in the absence of cytokine stimulation and transfected with the calcium coprecipitation method, the basal transcriptional activity was barely detectable (Fig.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This is consistent with our recent results, which showed that HIV-1 expression in cultured microglial cells is dependent on prestimulation with proinflammatory cytokines (37).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Upon cotransfection with the COUP-TF expression vector, LTR-driven CAT expression was induced 20-fold.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	126	 As a control, overexpression of the tumor suppressor p53, which is known to repress HIV-1 transcription (41), did not induce any CAT activity (Fig.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The basal transcription activity remained quite low.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These results confirm that, similar to the situation observed in brain cell lines, COUP-TF, Sp1, and NF-IL6 function as HIV-1 transcriptional activators in primary microglia.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In the absence of COUP-TF overexpression, transcription in the CAT reporter gene was low; overexpression of COUP-TF led to a large increase in the transcription rate (Fig.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	188	 With this 68/+80 LTR-CAT vector, Tat alone or in combination with COUP-TF stimulated CAT activity 35-fold (Fig.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	189	Deletion of the TAR region, the binding site of Tat (43) in 68/+29LTR-CAT, did not significantly affect COUP-TF-mediated stimulation (Fig.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	190	 5, lane 6), and as expected, it abolished Tat-induced activation (lanes 7 and 8).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Deletion or mutation of the Sp1 sites in the truncated 40/+80 LTR, in 283/+80 LTRSp1mut, or in 283/+80B/Sp1 led to the abolition of COUP-TF-induced activation (Fig.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	192	 5, lanes 10, 14, and 18) because Sp1 is required for COUP-TF transactivation in microglial cells (18); similarly, Tat-induced activation was abolished (lanes 11, 15, and 19), because Sp1 is required for efficient Tat transactivation (26, 28).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Surprisingly, overexpression of the combination of Tat and COUP-TF resulted in a 8-14-fold transcriptional stimulation (lanes 12, 16, and 20).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	194	To determine whether this COUP-TF/Tat cooperation requires the cognate HIV-1 TATAA region, we constructed a vector containing the 40/+80 LTR region in which the HIV-1 TATA sequence (TATAAGC) was replaced with the SV40 TATA box (TATTTAT).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Transfection experiments performed with the 40/+80-SV40-TATA-CAT vector showed that COUP-TF or Tat overexpression was unable to stimulate transcription, similar to the results obtained with the nonmutated vector.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	196	 However, overexpression of both COUP-TF and Tat in the presence of the mutated vector did not lead to any increase in CAT activity, indicating that COUP-TF is able to discriminate between different versions of TATAAs (result not shown).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	197	These findings reveal a functional synergism between COUP-TF and Tat, able to transactivate the LTR in the absence of NF-B and Sp1 sites.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	198	 These results further suggest that Tat and COUP-TF are able to interact, directly or indirectly.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The truncated COUP-TF was unable to stimulate CAT activity (lane 2), because we have shown previously that the C-terminal domain of COUP-TF is essential for its transcriptional activity (18).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Interestingly, in the presence of Tat, overexpression of the truncated COUP-TF led to a 50% inhibition of Tat-mediated activation (lane 4).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This result reveals the dominant negative role of the C-terminal truncated protein on Tat activity as well as the importance of the C-terminal region for the synergistic effect with Tat.

0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	253	In the present work, we have established the importance of the nuclear receptor COUP-TF as an activator of HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in primary microglia, the main target of HIV-1 in brain.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Overexpression of COUP-TF is able to stimulate viral expression of not only the macrophage-tropic 95.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	255	33 strain but also of the lymphotropic LAI HIV-1 strain, previously described to poorly replicate in microglia (44).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Our findings highlight the unexpected role of COUP-TF, which appears to possess a transactive ability similar to that of the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-IL6.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	257	 These nuclear factors are essential for inducing HIV-1 gene transcription in the immediate-early phase of HIV infection, when viral transcription proceeds at a low rate prior to the participation of viral activating proteins.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Our run-on data show that COUP-TF stimulates transcription by acting at the level of initiation.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	259	The action of these cellular proteins leads to the early phase of HIV infection and to the production of the viral protein Tat (14, 20).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	260	 By a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we have demonstrated the existence of a novel physical and functional interaction between the transcription factor COUP-TF and the viral transactivator Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In vitro GST pull-down experiments indicate that the N-terminal part of COUP-TF containing the DNA-binding domain is sufficient for interaction with Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In vitro association of Tat with COUP-TF does not depend on exon 2 and requires the Tat region located between amino acids 48 and 72 (formed by the basic domain, which mediates specific binding to TAR RNA) and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 58-72).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Interestingly, the regions involved in the protein-protein interaction are similar to those described for the thyroid hormone receptor, another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	264	 T3R also interacts with Tat through amino acids present in the DNA-binding domain of the receptor; the basic and C-terminal regions of Tat are involved in the binding to T3R (32).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In addition, our data obtained with microglial cells transfected with a Tat expression vector confirm that Tat and COUP-TF are able to interact directly within cells.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Recent data showed that Sp1 binds Tat amino acids 20-55 (45).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	267	 When these data are considered together, one could suspect that a ternary complex of COUP-TF, Sp1, and Tat represents the functionally important molecule.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	268	 However, we show here that a synergistic effect between COUP-TF and Tat is observed only in the absence of Sp1 sites, whereas the Sp1 and COUP-TF proteins lead to a synergistic transcriptional increase in the presence of Sp1 sites (18).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This suggests that COUP-TF interacts preferentially with either Sp1 bound to its DNA site or to Tat bound to the TAR element.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Moreover, Tat and Sp1 both interact with the same N-terminal region of COUP-TF, which further strengthens the idea that the binary complexes COUP-TF/Sp1 and COUP-TF/Tat are functionally important.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	271	A number of reports have demonstrated that the Sp1 and B sequences are required for TAR-dependent transactivation by Tat (26, 28-31, 33).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Here, our studies with various LTR mutants reveal that an interaction between COUP-TF and Tat can lead to NF-B- and Sp1-independent enhanced transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, in the presence of an intact TAR element.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Previous reports have shown that replication of HIV-1 of which the Sp1 sites had been deleted was efficient in MT4 lymphocytes and in activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and appeared to require NF-B as a substitute for Sp1 (46).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Here, our data suggest an alternative regulatory pathway for Tat transactivation in microglia that is independent of both NF-B and Sp1, through direct interactions of Tat with the nuclear receptor COUP-TF.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	275	The following model may account for the interaction of the nuclear receptor COUP-TF and viral Tat in regulating the HIV-1 LTR.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In the presence of Sp1 sites, the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF associates with the Sp1 protein bound to its DNA binding site (18).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In such a situation, COUP-TF is unable to interact with Tat and thus is unable to synergize with Tat.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In contrast, in the absence of Sp1 sites, COUP-TF appears to be able to recruit Tat and to substitute for the Sp1 protein.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	279	 However, this effect is TAR-dependent and requires binding of Tat to TAR.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	280	 As shown here, the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF binds to Tat, whereas the C terminus of COUP-TF interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIB, as described previously (47).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	281	 These interactions may thus anchor Tat to the transcriptional apparatus.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	282	 However, this recruitment is insufficient for Tat activity as it does not permit a TAR independent transactivation.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	283	 It is clear that the precise molecular mechanisms need to be further investigated.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	284	The nuclear receptor COUP-TF is known to be ubiquitously expressed, including in T lymphocytes, the main target of HIV-1 in the immune system.
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Similar to its action in microglia, COUP-TF functions as a transcriptional activator in lymphocytes, by acting through the Sp1 element of the HIV-1 LTR (48).
0.30958837.10644726.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Because our data in CNS cells revealed the unexpected role of COUP-TF in the presence of Tat, it will be interesting in further studies to examine the role of COUP-TF in the regulation of various HIV-1 strains in cells of the immune system.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	7	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   PPAR is a nuclear receptor that controls lipid and glucose metabolism and exerts antiinflammatory activities.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The factors regulating human PPAR (hPPAR) gene expression remain largely unexplored.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	9	 To study the mechanisms controlling hPPAR expression, the hPPAR gene promoter was identified and characterized.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	10	 First, an alternatively spliced exon within the 5'-untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was identified by RT-PCR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Next, the transcription start site was mapped and the hPPAR gene promoter was cloned and functionally analyzed.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Because PPAR levels are elevated in tissues expressing the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4), such as liver, the regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 was examined.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Transient transfections in HepG2 and Cos cells showed that HNF4 enhances hPPAR promoter activity.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	14	 5'-Deletion and mutation analysis of the hPPAR promoter identified a regulatory element (RE) consisting of a degenerate hexamer repeat with a single nucleotide spacer (direct repeat 1), termed HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Gel shift assays demonstrated that HNF4 binds to this HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, HNF4 increased the activity of a heterologous promoter driven by two copies of the HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The nuclear receptor COUP-TFII also bound this site and down-regulated basal as well as HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Finally, PPAR was shown to bind the HNF4-RE, leading to an induction of PPAR expression in hepatocytes.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In summary, the organization of the 5'-flanking and untranslated region of the hPPAR gene was characterized and the hPPAR promoter region has been identified.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the hPPAR gene is regulated by nuclear receptors, such as HNF-4, COUP-TFII, and PPAR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	21	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   PPAR [NR1C1] IS a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates gene transcription by heterodimerizing with RXR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	22	 PPAR/RXR heterodimers bind to PPAR response elements (PPREs) consisting of a direct repeat of the core AGGTCA sequence spaced by 1 or 2 bp [direct repeat 1 or 2 (DR1 or DR2)] preceded by a 5'-A/T-rich flanking sequence (1).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, PPAR represses gene transcription by interfering with the nuclear factor B (NFB) and activating protein 1 (AP1) signaling pathways in a DNA binding-independent fashion (2).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	24	PPAR-mediated transcriptional regulation of target genes is tightly controlled by ligand activation.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Fatty acid (FA) derivatives and the hypolipidemic fibrates are natural and synthetic PPAR ligands, respectively (3).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PPAR mediates the action of fibrates on plasma lipid levels by regulating the transcription of genes controlling lipoprotein metabolism (4).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, PPAR is a pivotal modulator of intracellular lipid metabolism by regulating the gene expression of proteins involved in FA uptake, FA esterification, FA entry into the mitochondria, peroxisomal and mitochondrial FA catabolism, and ketone body synthesis (1).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition to intra- and extracellular lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis as well as body weight were also reported to be influenced by PPAR activators (5, 6).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, PPAR is an important regulator of vascular inflammation.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	30	 PPAR inhibits the expression of various inducible factors implicated in the promotion of a local inflammatory response within the developing atherosclerotic plaque (2).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition, PPAR regulates the expression of lipoprotein receptors and cholesterol transporters involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway in macrophages (7, 8).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	32	 PPAR activators reduce plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in vivo (9, 10) and reduce the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in humans (11, 12, 13, 14).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	33	In addition to ligand activation, transcriptional control of PPAR target genes depends on its expression levels.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	34	 High levels of PPAR expression are observed in tissues with elevated FA catabolic rates, such as liver, heart, kidney, muscle, and the large intestine (15, 16, 17).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In rodents, PPAR is regulated by stress (18) and by different hormones, such as GH, glucocorticoids, insulin, and leptin (19, 20, 21, 22).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	36	 PPAR expression oscillates diurnally (18), is diminished with age (23), and is induced during brown adipocyte differentiation (24).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, starvation increases PPAR expression levels in liver leading to changes in mRNA levels of PPAR target genes (25).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Low PPAR mRNA levels result in decreased PPAR activity in pancreatic islets of obese Zucker diabetic (fa/fa) rats (22), in rat cardiomyocytes during cardiac hypertrophy (26), in livers of male Syrian hamsters upon lipopolysaccharide administration (27), and in intestinal epithelial cells during hypoxia (28).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Moreover, PPAR expression levels correlate with human apo AI gene induction in response to fibrate treatment as demonstrated in human apo AI transgenic mice crossed with PPAR-deficient mice (29).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	40	However, to date, studies addressing the regulation of PPAR gene expression have been largely performed either in rodent cells or in animal models.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Although the regulation of PPAR expression in humans remains largely unknown, the observation that hepatic PPAR mRNA levels vary significantly among individuals (30, 31) suggests that PPAR is also regulated at the transcriptional level in humans.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Indeed, hPPAR mRNA levels are induced during monocyte differentiation into macrophages (32), and high glucose concentrations up-regulate PPAR gene expression in human macrophages from healthy control subjects as well as from type 2 diabetic patients (33).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	43	To understand the molecular mechanisms governing PPAR regulation, we decided to identify and functionally characterize the 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In the present manuscript the transcription start site was determined, and the upstream 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene was identified and cloned and its transcriptional activity was examined.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	45	1 In the course of these studies the sequence of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the hPPAR gene was completed and an alternatively spliced exon within the 5'-UTR of the gene was identified.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Finally, hPPAR promoter activity was shown to be regulated by the nuclear receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), and PPAR itself.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	47	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Characterization of the 5'-UTR Structure of the hPPAR Gene and Identification of an Alternatively Spliced 5'-UTR Variant The hPPAR gene contains at least eight exons in which exons 1 and 2 and the 5'-end of exon 3 and the 3'-end of exon 8 are not translated (34, 35).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The aim of our study was to determine the 5'-UTR structure of the hPPAR gene and to identify and characterize the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	49	 To identify noncoding exons within this region, different primers were designed and PCRs were carried out on reverse transcribed human liver RNA from two different subjects.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Using this approach, a novel exon was discovered.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	51	 When PCR was performed using a primer designed at the 3'-end of exon 2 (primer 13, Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	52	 1A) and a primer hybridizing the 3'-end of exon 1 (primer 15C, Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	53	 1A), a fragment of 158 bp containing both exon 1 and exon 2 was amplified (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Additionally, a second fragment 150 bp longer was repeatedly coamplified even at stringent PCR conditions.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Similar results were obtained with four other human liver and adipose tissue mRNA samples (data not shown), indicating that the unexpected additional PCR product corresponded to a rather common transcript.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Cloning and sequencing of this PCR fragment revealed the presence of 156 bp of novel sequence downstream of the sequence previously known as exon 1 (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Furthermore, when PCR was performed using a primer within the novel sequence (primer IP3) and the exon 1-specific primer 15C, a fragment was amplified, further indicating the existence of this additional exon (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The novel sequence was located between exon 1 and 2 in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing the hPPAR gene and was flanked by ag/gt consensus acceptor and donor splice sites, respectively (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The newly identified exon was named exon 1b, by analogy to the nomenclature used for the alternatively spliced exon present in the 5'-UTR of the mouse PPAR gene (36), whereas the previously known exon 1 was renamed exon 1a (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In addition, when 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) reactions were carried out using primer IP3 located in exon 1b as gene-specific primer, a fragment covering the novel exon plus a sequence corresponding to exon 1a was amplified (data not shown), corroborating the existence of a second alternative transcript containing exon 1b in addition to exon 1a.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	61	 This suggests that exon 1b is spliced out alternatively giving rise to two different transcripts with distinct 5'-UTRs (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Thus, both mouse and human PPAR (hPPAR) genes display a similar 5'-UTR genomic organization.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, the noncoding exons do not show a significant degree of sequence homology among species (38% for exon 1a and 29% for exon 1b).

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Genomic sequence upstream of the previously reported exon 1a sequence (37) was obtained by primer walking the BAC clone containing the hPPAR gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Despite the overall low degree of homology shown by the PPAR 5'-UTRs among different species, a sequence of around 60 bp was found to be 88% homologous to a region close to the transcription start site in the mouse PPAR 5'-UTR (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	80	 This prompted us to examine whether the transcription start site in the human gene could also be upstream of this region.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Accordingly, a primer close to that sequence (primer IP18, Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	82	 2A) was used as gene-specific primer in a 5'-RACE-PCR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A 213-bp DNA fragment was amplified from human liver RNA (Fig.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The most 5'-nucleotide before the poly-dC tail introduced by the 5'-RACE procedure mapped to a T and was designated as nucleotide +1 (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Similar results were obtained when a different gene-specific primer (primer 5-GSP) was used in the 5'-RACE-PCR (data not shown).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	87	 To confirm the results of the 5'-RACE experiments, ribonuclease (RNase) protection analysis was performed.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	88	 RNase mapping with a 337-nucleotide labeled cRNA probe complementary to bp -22 to +213 (Fig.

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	91	 These data indicate that exon 1a is considerably longer than the partially sequenced exon 1 that had been previously reported (34, 35, 37) and than the exon 1a identified in the mouse PPAR gene (36).

0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	238	The transcription start site of the hPPAR gene was mapped.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The proximal promoter of the hPPAR gene contains no typical TATA or CCAAT boxes and has a high GC content, including several consensus Sp1 sites, features that are also present in the mouse PPAR promoter (36).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Excluding the proximal GC-rich region, both promoters do not show a high degree in sequence homology (40%).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	241	 However, only a small fragment of the mouse PPAR promoter has been sequenced to date (36).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This sequence disparity in both the 5'-UTR and the promoter regions may indicate that PPAR gene expression among species could be regulated in a different manner although sufficient data to establish a thorough comparison between species are lacking at this stage.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	243	Computer-assisted analysis of the hPPAR promoter sequence identified various putative transcription factor binding sites, such as sites for members of the early growth response (Egr) gene family, which are involved in the induction of monocytic differentiation (45).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Egr proteins could thus be involved in the up-regulation of hPPAR expression upon monocyte differentiation into macrophages (32) although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Furthermore, potential sites for NFB and AP1, factors involved in the transduction of several cytokine and proinflammatory signals, as well as for the myeloid zinc finger gene, MZF-1, were found in the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	246	 PPAR inhibition of NFB- and AP1-induced expression of inflammatory response genes (46) lies at the basis of its antiinflammatory activities.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	247	 It is tempting to speculate that hPPAR expression, in its turn, is controlled by inflammatory cytokines.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Because rodent PPAR mRNA levels are increased by glucocorticoids (20, 21), putative GR response elements were searched for.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	249	 No obvious GR response element could be detected within the hPPAR regulatory region analyzed; however, regulation studies in human tissues or cell lines would be necessary to determine whether hPPAR expression is also modulated by glucocorticoids in humans.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	250	HNF4 is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in liver-specific gene expression (47) and is required for mammalian hepatocyte differentiation and for normal metabolic regulation in liver (48).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	251	 HNF4 is expressed at high levels in liver, kidney, and intestine (47).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	252	 It binds as homodimers to DR1-like response elements, thereby modulating the expression of several liver-enriched genes encoding apolipoproteins, coagulation factors, serum proteins, proteins of the cytochrome P450 family, and genes involved in FA and glucose metabolism (49).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Regulation of hPPAR by HNF4 is consistent with the tissue-expression pattern shown by PPAR.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In the present study induction of hPPAR promoter activity by HNF4 is reported.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	255	 A HNF4-RE was identified at nt -1,492 to -1,483 within the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This element closely resembles several HNF4-REs found in other genes and the GGGGCA A AGGTCA consensus HNF4 binding site (50).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Moreover, the regulation of PPAR gene expression by HNF4 in vivo in mice was recently demonstrated using HNF4-deficient mice (51).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	258	 These mice display significantly lower PPAR mRNA levels compared with the wild-type mice, thus demonstrating that PPAR expression is regulated by HNF4 also in mice.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Nevertheless, the promoter experiments performed with the hPPAR promoter indicate that the HNF4 site identified is not responsible for the activity of the hPPAR promoter in liver because the promoter construct lacking this site still possesses a significant activity in HepG2 cells (Fig.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	260	 This may suggest that this site binds as well other factors, such as COUP-TF, present in these cells that negatively regulate the hPPAR promoter either as a result of a direct repression of the promoter or due to competition with factors, such as HNF4, for binding to the site.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In addition, negative factors may bind to sites located between -1,664 and -1,206 bp in the hPPAR promoter.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Future studies on the regulation of this promoter will be required to elucidate the factors governing hPPAR gene expression in liver.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	263	Members of the COUP-TF family of orphan nuclear receptors have been reported to bind DR1 sites that are also recognized by HNF4 (52).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	264	 COUP-TF actively represses or antagonizes HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation of several genes (39, 41, 42, 43, 44).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	265	 COUP-TF II has been shown to play a role in cardiac energy metabolism and heart development (53, 54).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	266	 In this study, COUP-TFII was also shown to bind the HNF4-RE within the hPPAR regulatory region and to repress both basal and HNF4-induced hPPAR promoter activity.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The COUP-TFII antagonism may finely tune HNF4-dependent gene expression.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The expression level of a COUP-TFII/HNF4 target gene would therefore depend on the relative concentrations of both transcription factors in a given cell type or during a certain condition.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	269	 For instance, the age-dependent diminution of apo AI gene expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional level and to be associated with a decrease in the binding capacity and expression of HNF4 and a parallel increase in COUP-TFII binding and concentration levels (55).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Interestingly, PPAR gene expression is also diminished in aged rats (23).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Further studies are required to demonstrate whether the molecular mechanisms described for the age-dependent decline of apo AI can also explain the decreased expression of PPAR with age.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	272	Finally, PPAR is also capable of binding to the HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Induction of PPAR gene expression by PPAR agonists has been reported in different rodent cell lines (22, 24, 56).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Our data indicate that PPAR agonists, such as fenofibrate, induce hPPAR mRNA levels in primary cultures of human hepatocytes as well as hPPAR promoter activity, suggesting that these effects are exerted at the transcriptional level.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Furthermore, induction of hPPAR promoter activity is dependent on the identified HNF4-RE.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Autoregulation is a common feature among nuclear receptors.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	277	 For instance, GRs are regulated by glucocorticoids, and glucocorticoids exert these actions mainly at the level of transcription (57).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	278	 AR is another nuclear receptor that is autoregulated (58), and three different ER promoters have been shown to be regulated by estrogens (59).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	279	The coding exons of the hPPAR gene have been screened for polymorphisms.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	280	 A leucine-to-valine missense mutation at codon 162 in exon 5 of the hPPAR gene (L162V) was recently identified (34, 35).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This polymorphism shows an enhanced transactivation activity (34) and has been associated with altered plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in type 2 diabetic subjects (34), supporting a role for PPAR in dyslipidemia and diabetes in humans also.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Variants have been identified in other exons and introns of the hPPAR gene (Ref.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Staels, unpublished observations).
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, these polymorphisms either show low frequency in the populations studied or they do not directly affect PPAR activity due to their location in intronic sequences of the gene.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Thus, it will be interesting to search for polymorphisms in the promoter sequences of the gene that may affect PPAR expression and function.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	286	Taken together, the 5'-flanking region of the hPPAR gene has been characterized, cloned, and functionally studied.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	287	 HNF4 induces hPPAR expression via a DR1 element present in the hPPAR promoter, whereas this effect is antagonized by the orphan receptor COUP-TFII.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In addition, PPAR itself modulates its own expression.
0.37514272.11981036.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Knowledge of the hPPAR promoter structure will allow further studies of the molecular mechanisms governing hPPAR gene regulation.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	57	 To avoid any interference with the endogenous proteins, the effect of HNF4 on the transactivation activity of HNF1 was analysed in HeLa cells.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The experiments were performed on a synthetic promoter consisting of one HNF1 binding site located upstream of the TATA box (HNF1-TATA promoter) and on the natural liver pyruvate kinase promoter ( to 96/+11) LPK containing one HNF1 binding site (site L1, position  to 96/ to 72) but lacking the HNF4 response element (28).

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	84	  To control the possibility that HNF4 does not act as a transcriptional partner of another transcription factor, we analysed the effect of HNF4 on the VP16 activation domain fused to the GAL4 DBD (construct GAL4-VP16).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	85	 HNF4 was unable to enhance the VP16-mediated activation of transcription (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	86	 1C), thus indicating the selectivity of the cooperation between HNF4 and HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	87	As predicted from the results of Ktistaki and Talianidis (9), we observed that full-length HNF1 and HNF4 physically interact (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Interestingly, pull-down experiments also showed that HNF1 lacking its activation domain (HNF1-AD) efficiently interacted with HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This result indicates that the sequence 1 to 291 of HNF1, containing the dimerization and DNA binding domains, is able to interact with HNF4.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This prompted us to investigate whether coexpression of HNF4 and HNF1-AD could activate the HNF1-TATA promoter.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Despite their efficient interaction, HNF1-AD and HNF4 were unable to activate transcription (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	92	 1E), thus indicating that cooperation between HNF1 and HNF4 requires the HNF1 activation domain.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	93	AF2 is not the only sequence within the HNF4 LBD required for interaction and cooperation with HNF1 The repressive action of HNF1 on HNF4 was unambiguously shown to require the HNF4 LBD (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, using truncated fragments of HNF4, Ktistaki and Talianidis mapped the sequence involved in the interaction with HNF1 between residues 337 and 368, leading to the conclusion that the HNF4 AF2 activation function is necessary and sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	95	 In fact, this sequence does not contain solely the AF2 (sequence 358 to 366 corresponding to helix 12 of the LBD), but also a fragment forming part of the large helix termed H10 to H11, according to conventional nomenclature (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Indeed, H10 and H11 are contiguous in HNF4 and form a helix that plays a key role in HNF4 function (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Furthermore, the integrity of this helix is crucial for protein conformation (32).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	98	 These recent findings begged a re-evaluation of the HNF4 sequence involved in interaction with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Using full-length HNF4, we analysed the effects of point mutations located in the HNF4 LBD (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	100	 2A) on the interaction and cooperation with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The E262A mutation was shown to affect HNF4 dimerization (26).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The E276Q mutation does not alter the intrinsic HNF4 transcriptional activity but impairs recruitment of HNF4 transcriptional partners (24,33).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Owing to the bulky side chain of phenylalanine, the A223F mutation was hypothesized to affect occupancy of the ligand binding pocket by fatty acids that act as structural cofactors rather than as conventional ligands (31).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Accord ingly, A223F mutation mildly impaired HNF4 transcriptional activity and interaction with coactivators (data not shown).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In the AF2 module, the acidic group of the amino acid residue side chain at position 363 and the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid residue side chain at position 365 are strictly conserved and play a key role in nuclear receptor function (34).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Residue L366 is also important since the L366Q mutation alters HNF4 transcriptional activity (35).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Pull-down assays showed that introducing three mutations E363K, L365Q and L366Q in the AF2 (HNF4-AF2mut construct) altered interaction between HNF4 and HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Note however that the decrease in interaction was mild.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This result confirms the involvement of the AF2 in the interaction between HNF1 and HNF4 but indicates that this module is not the unique sequence required for interaction between these proteins.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Interaction with HNF1 was also significantly decreased by the A223F and E276Q mutations while mutation E262A had no effect (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Consistent with data from pull-down assays, the HNF4-mediated enhancement of HNF1-dependent transcriptional activation of the ( to 96/+11) LPK promoter was not impaired by the E262A mutation but was significantly decreased with the mutants A223F, E276Q and HNF4-AF2mut (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We controlled so that mutant and wild-type HNF4 were expressed at a similar level in transfected cells as shown in Figure 2D for mutants A223F and HNF4-AF2mut and in (24,26) for the mutant E276Q and E262A, respectively.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	113	 It appears therefore that the interaction and cooperation between HNF4 and HNF1 depend on both the AF2 module (helix 12) and the integrity of the HNF4 LBD.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Pull-down experiments clearly showed a much weaker interaction of p300 with HNF4-AF2mut than with wild-type HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This result is in line with our previous observation that deletion of the AF2 resulted in a decrease in interaction (about 70%) between HNF4 and p300 (33).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Therefore, we cannot exclude that the impaired cooperativity of HNF4-AF2mut was also due to reduced p300 recruitment.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Because it has been documented that HNF4 and CBP/p300 form a transcriptionally active complex (36), we verified whether in our experimental conditions this complex was sufficient to achieve the strong cooperation.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	168	 HNF4 also interacted with the p300 carboxy-terminal region as shown in Figure 4C.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The presence of multiple interaction surfaces between these proteins led us to analyse the effect of HNF4 on the recruitment of the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of p300 to HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The strategy consisted of determining whether HNF4 affects the cooperation between HNF1 and the amino- or carboxy-terminal fragments of p300 fused to the VP16 activation domain named Np300-VP16 and Cp300-VP16, respectively (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Expression of the VP16 activation domain affected neither the basal activity of the promoter nor its activity in the presence of expression vectors for HNF1 alone or together with HNF4 (Fig.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	194	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It has been previously shown that HNF1 acts as a repressor of HNF4-mediated activation of transcription (8,9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In this study, we show that HNF4 can serve as a coactivator for HNF1 since HNF4 is able to enhance HNF1 activity in a DNA-binding independent manner.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	196	 A synergy between HNF1 and HNF4 can be inferred from data obtained in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells on a promoter containing binding sites for these two HNFs.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Since mutation of the HNF4 binding site did not affect this synergy, the authors suggested that this effect probably did not involve HNF4 DNA binding (37).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In light of our results, these data can now most probably be explained by the ability of HNF4 to directly act as a HNF1 coactivator.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Analysis of the physiological role of this HNF4 coactivator function in cell types that endogenously express HNF1 and HNF4 cannot be realized by conventional targeting of HNF4 expression since HNF4 also positively regulates HNF1 expression.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therefore, this concern will first require development of an experimental model that permits to distinguish between HNF4 effects linked to regulation of HNF1 expression on one hand and to regulation of HNF1 transcriptional activity on the other hand (Fig.

0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Cross-talk between HNF1 and HNF4.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The cross-talk involves both expression activation, through binding to promoters (solid lines), and modulation of the transcriptional potential, through protein to protein interactions (dotted lines), of the other HNF transcription factor.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	204	  Interplays between two transcription factors in both activation and repression of transcription have already been documented.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Indeed, cross-talk between HNF6 and HNF3ss, two other liver-enriched transcription factors, also results in opposite effects on the activities of these proteins (38).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	206	Despite their efficient interaction, HNF4 and HNF1 lacking its activation function (HNF1-AD) were unable to cooperate.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Such a behaviour is reminiscent of that of CBP and P/CAF with HNF1 (1 to 280) (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Only the simultaneous overexpression of CBP and P/CAF together with that of the truncated HNF1 could activate transcription (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This points to a critical role for the HNF1 activation domain, which could be the recruitment of other required coactivators and/or stabilization of the transcriptional complex recruited by HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	210	Our results indicate that the HNF4 AF2 is involved in interaction with HNF1, but also that other regions of the HNF4 LBD are required for full interaction between these proteins.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Ktistaki and Talianidis previously stated that the HNF4 AF2 is sufficient for interaction with HNF1 (9).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The discrepancy between their conclusion and our results is likely explained by the fact that these authors used deletion of a fragment (residues 337 to 368), which includes not only the AF2 but also part of the large helix H10 to H11, the integrity of which has meanwhile been shown to be crucial for the protein conformation (32).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	213	 We observed that two-point mutations in the HNF4 LBD, A223F and E276Q, significantly decreased interaction and cooperation with HNF1 thus demonstrating that the integrity of the HNF4 LBD is required for the synergy with HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	214	The similarity of phenotypes exhibited by diabetic patients carrying MODY1 and MODY3 mutations has been ascribed to the mutual control of transcription of HNF1 and HNF4.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The ability of HNF4 to serve as an HNF1 coactivator could provide an additional explanation to the closely related phenotypes of these MODY forms of diabetes.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Impairment of interaction and of enhancement of HNF1 transcriptional activity by the HNF4 E276Q mutation may be physiologically relevant since this mutation is correlated with MODY1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Unfortunately, the low transfection efficiency and the presence of large amounts of endogenous HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells prevented us from analysing the effects of this mutation on the synergy between HNF4 and HNF1 in these cells.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	218	Our results support a model that involves the combined action of HNF4 and the coactivator p300 to achieve the highest rate of transcription mediated by HNF1.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Our results also strongly suggest that HNF4 improves p300 recruitment.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The synergy between HNF4 and p300 may be mediated in two ways.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The first involves simultaneous interactions of HNF4 and p300 with HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	222	 In this case, HNF4 could indirectly improve HNF1 to p300 interaction through induction of a HNF1 conformational change.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Such a mechanism is reminiscent of that of the CBP-mediated improvement of the interaction between HNF1 and P/CAF (21).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Similarly, upon docking to PPAR, PGC-1 undergoes a conformational change that permits binding of SRC-1 and p300 (39).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The second involves docking of p300 by HNF4, which is bound to HNF1 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The recruitment of p300 to the HNF1 to HNF4 complex could be mediated by its amino- and/or carboxy-terminal regions, which contain the C/H1 and C/H3 domains, respectively.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	227	 These domains are known to be involved in protein to protein interactions (40).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The presence of multiple interaction surfaces in HNF1, HNF4 and p300 most probably facilitates formation of a ternary complex formed with these proteins (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The remaining synergy between HNF1 and HNF4 after mutations in the HNF4 AF2 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	230	 3) may be accounted for by the ability of p300 to interact and activate the HNF4 AF1 (33,41) and by the fact that the two above mentioned mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	231	In conclusion, our results highlight a new way by which HNF4 can regulate gene expression.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	232	 HNF4 not only directly binds to promoters but also, through interaction with other transcription factors already bound to DNA, can facilitate coactivator recruitment to further enhance transcription.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Recently, it has been shown that HNF4 also serves as coactivator for Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding protein-2 (42).
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Furthermore, our results yield insights into a higher complexity of the transcriptional network and on the primordial relationship between HNF1 and HNF4 (Fig.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	235	 In the regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4, HNF4 can activate both HNF1 expression and transcriptional activity.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In contrast to these additive processes, the negative effect of HNF1 on HNF4 transcriptional activity can attenuate the HNF1-mediated activation of expression.
0.4318962.15141028.html.plaintext.txt	237	 These regulatory feedback mechanisms will have to be taken into account considering that HNF1 and HNF4 are involved in a large diversity of pathways controlling function of multiple organs, notably liver and endocrine pancreas.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Point mutations introduced within the ShhRE reveal some key nucleotides that are essential for protein(s)-binding activity.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, the ShhRE is capable of functioning as a true enhancer element and can mediate Shh-induced transactivation of reporter gene via a heterologous promoter.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Sonic hedgehog Shh is a vertebrate member of the Drosophila segment polarity gene family and is a secreted morphogen that is responsible for providing the ventralizing signals within the neural tube (1, 2).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The Drosophila homolog of Shh, called hedgehog (Hh), is expressed as a 471-amino acid polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved at amino acid 257 by a unique autoproteolytic mechanism (3).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The C terminus of Hh harbors this proteolytic activity, and the N terminus, which includes the signal peptide sequence, is the secreted form of the protein.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Several reports indicate that the N-terminal 20-kDa protein harbors the signaling activity of this morphogen (4, 5).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Similar observations have been made for its murine homolog with respect to its N-terminal activity.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Consistent with this observation is the high degree of homology (94 to 99%) at the N-terminal 180 amino acids between mouse, chicken, and zebra fish members of the hedgehog gene family (1).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	16	It has been reported that increased Shh expression in the notochord results in the increased expression of HNF3ss in the floor plate and the subsequent appearance of other ventral markers in the neural tube (6).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This results in the suppression of the dorsalizing signals, induced by BMP-2/4 originating from the neuroectoderm (7).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The appearance of ventral markers within the neural tube establishes a dorso-ventral boundary, which is broadly described as dorso-ventral patterning.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The induction of motor neuron markers within the ventro-lateral region is coincident with this Shh-mediated activity in the neural tube.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Jessell and co-workers (8) have demonstrated that conditioned media from COS-1 cells that overexpress and secrete Shh can mediate motor neuron differentiation in naive neural plate explants.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	21	Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and belong to the orphan receptor subclass (9, 10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Two genes called COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been identified in mammals.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	23	 COUP-TFs are capable of dimerizing with the retinoid X receptor and are known to affect the regulation of retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor responsive genes (9).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	24	 COUP-TFs in general are expressed during embryonic development and are proposed to mediate essential mesenchymal-epithelial interactions that are crucial for proper organogenesis (10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	25	 To that effect, mRNA of COUP-TFII has been detected in the mesenchymal compartment of several developing organs such as the kidney, breast, and prostate (10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	26	COUP-TFs are expressed in the developing murine central and peripheral nervous systems.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	27	 It is hypothesized that these two genes play a role in regulating the developmental fates of diencephalic neuromeres by altering the expression of some of the key factors involved in cell fate determination (11).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Most importantly, COUP-TFII mRNA is highly expressed in differentiating motor neurons within the neural tube of a developing chick embryo.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Notochord transplantation experiments suggest that this increase in COUP-TFII mRNA within the ventro-lateral region of the chick neural tube is mediated by signals derived from the notochord (12).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Hence, we hypothesize that Shh, a secreted morphogen derived from the notochord, can elicit this increase in COUP-TFII expression in differentiating motor neurons.

0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In this experiment we observe that a dorso-laterally placed ectopic notochord can induce motor neurons in an ectopic location within the ventral tube, and this coincides with the appearance of COUP-TFII transcripts (12).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	132	 These results suggest that notochord-derived signals can induce COUP-TFII mRNA.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In this report we provide evidence to clearly indicate that COUP-TFII mRNA is up-regulated by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In addition, we have defined a novel target element within the COUP-TFII promoter that mediates most of this activity.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Also, the low dose of Shh, namely 1 nM, which is capable of inducing this ShhRE-mediated activity, is in close agreement with this overall effect as observed by Jessell and co-workers (16) in neural explant assays.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	136	The identification of this ShhRE provides us with a valuable tool to study the various signaling pathways that are induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Previously, it was reported by Ingham and his colleagues (17) that a binding site for the Ci (cubidus interruptus) protein is a consensus HhRE (GACCACCCA), since it mediates the activation of the ptc (patched) promoter by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Ptc is a downstream target gene of Hh and is part of the putative membrane-bound Shh receptor complex (18, 19, 20).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, the exact mechanism of ptc activation via this Ci element remains to be determined.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Interestingly, the ShhRE found on the COUP-TFII promoter bears very little similarity to that of the Drosophila Ci binding site.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In our oligo competition experiments, we demonstrate that any changes in the core sequence (TACATAATGCGCCG) are deleterious to Shh-induced binding.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Also, a transcription factor data bank analysis revealed very little information as to the exact identity of the factor(s) that may bind this element.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The identification of this novel response element suggests that in higher vertebrates the pleiotropic effects of Shh can be mediated by multiple pathways, some of which may target the Gli (mammalian homolog of Ci) binding site and others may target novel elements such as the one in the COUP-TFII promoter.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	144	 5, the DNA-binding complexes in P19 nuclear extracts are induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The precise mechanism for this increase in binding is not known.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	146	 It is possible that Shh may simply modulate the activity of this factor(s) that binds to the ShhRE.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In agreement with this possible modulatory role for Shh, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) has been implicated in the Hh-signaling pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In Drosophila, it is believed that PKA agonists can suppress signaling mediated by Hh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Also, localized loss of PKA -/- activity in a Drosophila imaginal disc can mimic Hh activity even in the absence of Hh (21, 22).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Similar results have been obtained using a dominant negative form of PKA in the mouse dorsal central nervous system (23, 24).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	151	 These observations have led to the popular belief that reversal of a PKA-repressed pathway is one of the major mechanisms of Hh activity in Drosophila and in mammals.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, we do not observe a significant decrease in our transient transfection assays when COS-1 cells are treated with both Shh and forskolin (90  microM) using the 3X ShhRE-tkCAT.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Also, forskolin fails to decrease Shh-induced binding in an EMSA using radiolabeled ShhRE (data not shown).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	154	 These results suggest that in higher vertebrates additional pathways that are independent of PKA may also be induced by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The identification of COUP-TFII as a novel target gene and the characterization of a ShhRE within its promoter may allow for the unraveling of this complex pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	156	Our results provide a novel target gene for Shh, namely COUP-TFII, which can be exploited to study some of the intermediate steps in the Shh-signaling pathway.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In particular, COUP-TFII is a very well characterized transcription factor whose ability to affect the function of several other nuclear receptors provides an attractive target for the pleiotropic effects of Shh signaling.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, the expression of COUP-TFII transcripts and areas in which Shh exerts its signaling activity may be limited to a few regions within the developing embryo (1, 10).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	159	The Shh homozygous null mice display the predicted phenotype based on the expression profile of this protein.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The Shh null mice display a cyclopia phenotype along with a loss of maintenance and organization along the axial midline structures of the developing embryo (25).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, in the Shh null mice we can detect some COUP-TFII transcripts (F.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This observation suggests that COUP-TFII is not exclusively regulated by Shh.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These results are not surprising since COUP-TFII is expressed throughout mouse embryonic development in a wide variety of tissues (10, 11).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Also, we and others have shown that COUP-TFs are downstream target genes of retinoic acid and that their expression is increased by treatment with both 9-cis and all-trans retinoic acid (13, 14).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	165	We have generated COUP-TFII homozygous null mice to study the possible involvement of COUP-TFII in motor-neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, the COUP-TFII null mice die before 10.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Interestingly, no obvious change in the overall morphology within the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube is observed (F.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We believe that the presence of COUP-TFI transcripts in the neural tube may allow for some functional compensation of COUP-TFII, which may obscure any obvious defects in motor neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	169	 We are currently attempting a localized knock out of both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube to study the possible involvement of these genes in motor neuron differentiation.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	170	Our results have provided a novel target gene for Shh signaling in P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Activation of COUP-TFII, which is known to harbor a trans-repressor domain in its C-terminal 15 amino acids, may have important implications in neural tube patterning (26).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Shh has been implicated in enabling the notochord-derived signals to repress the dorsalizing signals induced by BMP-2/4 from the roof plate and or the neural epithelium of the neural tube (7, 27).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	173	 It has been reported that COUP-TFI can inhibit the BMP-4 promoter in fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts (28).
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It is possible that temporal induction of COUP-TFII expression by Shh may serve to mediate this very repression in specific regions that are fated to become motor neurons in the ventro-lateral region of the neural tube.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In conclusion, our results provide a novel target gene (COUP-TFII) and a novel target element (ShhRE) that seem to mediate Shh-induced COUP-TFII expression in P19 mouse embryocarcinoma cells.
0.22919919.9280061.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This finding will allow for the elucidation of the numerous signaling pathways induced by Shh.

0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Finally, the parental TF1 cell line, which lacks the IL-15Rss chain, nevertheless expresses both a functional hybrid receptor that controls JAK3 phosphorylation and a novel IL-15/c/TRAF2 complex that triggers nuclear factor B activation.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The lineage-dependent distribution and function of these receptors suggest that they are involved in hematopoiesis because they modify transduction pathways that play a major role in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors.

0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	14	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The development of hematopoietic cells is controlled by hematopoietic growth factors, cytokines and chemokines produced in the bone marrow (BM)* by accessory cells and T lymphocytes (1, 2), and by several other mechanisms (3).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Hematopoietic factors constitute a complex network, in which each cytokine may act at various stages: for example, myeloid growth factors such as G-CSF and GM-CSF may also affect the lymphoid compartment (4, 5).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	16	 GM-CSF inhibits the expansion of the NK cell progenitor population from unprimed BM CD34+ cells, and the generation and functioning of NK cells both in vivo and in vitro (5, 6).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	17	 IL-15, the most powerful factor inducing the differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells into CD56+/CD3- NK cells in vivo (7), may also cause a large increase in the number of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) when added to the IL-3/SCF/Flt3-L combination (8).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Transgenic mice carrying a mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of the common gamma chain (c), or lacking the signaling kinase JAK3, both of which are necessary for IL-15 to mediated signaling, have very low lymphocyte counts and display dysregulated myelopoiesis (9, 10).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Moreover, the erythroid burst-forming cells of these mice have a larger than normal fraction of hematopoietic precursors with the CD34+/c- phenotype (11).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These data suggest that there is cross talk between myeloid growth factors and IL-15, which may regulate the balance between the myeloid and lymphoid lineages during hematopoietic differentiation.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This regulation may operate at the level of signal transduction because IL-15 and GM-CSF share signaling pathways (JAK2/STAT5 and NF-B) heavily involved in the control of hematopoiesis (12 to 16).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Alternatively, the cross talk between these two cytokines may involve direct interactions between their receptor subunits, as suggested by the fact that GM-CSF almost totally inhibits IL-2 binding to IL-2/IL-15Rss/c in the M07sb CD34+ hematopoietic cell line (17).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We investigated whether this cross talk resulted from a physical interaction between the two receptors, possibly involving the c chain and the GM-CSFRss chain.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Indeed, these two subunits identify two families of cytokines, one with the c chain (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-21; references 7 and 18) and the other, with the GM-CSFRss chain (IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF; reference 19).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	25	In this study, we demonstrate that normal CD34+ cells, but not nonhematopoietic cells, express a novel functional hybrid receptor composed of the c and GM-CSFRss chains, in which the GM-CSFRss chain may inhibit c/JAK3 signaling.

0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	311	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   We found that human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors express a novel hybrid receptor composed of the c chain of IL-2R and the GM-CSFRss chain.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	312	 This receptor was also found in CD34+ hematopoietic cell lines with proerythroid (TF1, TF1ss) or promegakaryocytic (M07sb) differentiation potentials and in CBPr CD34+/CD56- precursors, but not in the cytolytic NK-L cell line, normal NK cells or nonhematopoietic human cells, even though all these cells produce both chains.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	313	 The hybrid receptor is functional and mediates signal transduction by both the IL-15 and GM-CSF pathways.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Indeed, the results obtained with an anti-GM-CSFRss mAb suggested that, in TF1ss cells, the GM-CSFRss chain replaces the c chain, inhibiting its specific signaling (phosphorylation of JAK3), but that this chain cooperates with the IL-15Rss chain, facilitating the IL-15 to dependent activation of other JAK/STAT pathways (JAK1, JAK2, STAT5, and STAT6) and controlling the proliferation of these cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	315	 In contrast, an anti-c mAb inhibited the GM-CSF to dependent proliferation of TF1ss cells treated with the recombinant cytokine or cocultured with human stromal hematopoietic cells secreting GM-CSF.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	316	 This suggests that the hybrid receptor may have important effects in vivo, interfering in the interactions between CD34+ cells and stromal cells that play a major role in the control of both normal and pathological hematopoiesis (1, 2).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In addition, anti to IL-15Rss/c mAbs, and the specific JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P31, inhibited the nuclear translocation of STAT5 induced by rGM-CSF but did not inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT5.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	318	 These effects on STAT5 were also observed in M07Sb cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Our observation that the c subunit of the hybrid receptor controls the GM-CSF to dependent nuclear translocation of pSTAT5 rather than STAT5 phosphorylation is consistent with recent results showing that the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins are regulated independently (31, 32).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Indeed, in human keratinocytes, which express a type II IL-4R, IL-4 induces the phosphorylation of STAT3, but not its nuclear translocation (31), whereas the prolactin receptor (PRLR) regulates STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by means of two independent pathways (32).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	321	 With PRLR, the number of phosphorylated tyrosines on the receptor itself seems to play a critical role in the activation of a cellular component that controls the number of STAT5 complexes in the cytoplasm, by controlling the entry of these complexes into the nucleus (32).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Moreover, STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding via the IL-2Rss chain requires receptor phosphotyrosines (33), whereas similar events mediated by the G-CSFR are independent of receptor phosphotyrosines (34).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Thus, the structural organization of some receptors and the subsequent activation of particular signaling pathways may affect the translocation of STAT protein to the nucleus.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	324	On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the activation of STAT5 by rGM-CSF via the hybrid receptor c/GM-CSFRss.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	325	 We suggest that STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are regulated independently and that the translocation pathway is controlled by the c/JAK3 complex, which, in cells with type I IL-4R, is necessary for the translocation of STAT5 to the nucleus (35).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	326	The hybrid receptor is functional not only in leukemic cell precursors, but also in normal progenitors, although its functions appear more limited in normal cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Indeed, in normal CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors, the hybrid receptor controls the IL-15 to dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 but not of STAT3 and STAT6.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Moreover, levels of GM-CSF to dependent STAT5 phosphorylation are decreased by anti-c mAb in CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors, but not in TF1ss cells.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	329	 These differences may be due to differences in origin (normal versus pathological) and/or degree of primitiveness of the two types of CD34+ cell.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	330	 In any case, our results emphasize the involvement of the hybrid receptor in the control of normal and pathological hematopoiesis, with this receptor probably displaying various functions during hematopoietic development.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	331	The absence of the hybrid receptor on nonhematopoietic cells strengthens the evidence for its "specific" involvement in hematopoiesis.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The distribution of this receptor in cells of various lineages and functions suggests that it is involved in the development of hematopoiesis, probably affecting engagement in myeloid, rather than lymphoid, lineages.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Indeed, the inhibition of c/JAK3 signaling by the GM-CSFRss chain should be interpreted in light of the inhibition of lymphocyte maturation and myelopoiesis dysregulation observed in mice and humans bearing c or JAK3 deletions or mutations (9 to 11).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	334	In erythrocytic TF1 cells, we describe, for the first time, a novel IL-15R/c/TRAF2 complex that triggers specific IL-15 signaling, even though these cells do not express the IL-15Rss chain23, a subunit indispensable for the c chain functions (7).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Both subunits of the IL-15R/c heterodimer are functional, although they behave differently from what would be expected based on the results obtained for other cell types.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	336	 It has been reported that IL-15R, associating with the signaling molecule TRAF2, activates the transcription factor NF-B, in the absence of a link with the c chain (12, 24).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	337	 In contrast, in TF1 cells, IL-15R and c are associated but we nevertheless observed the phosphorylation, not only of IB, but also of JAK3 factors.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	338	 However, the phosphorylation of JAK3 factor was only observed in samples treated with rIL-15 and anti to GM-CSFRss mAb, indicating that the c/JAK3 pathway is functional in the absence of the IL-15Rss chain but is controlled by the hybrid receptor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	339	The association of IL-15R/c/TRAF2 may play a regulatory role at certain stages of hematopoiesis, associating NF-B activation, which is involved in the control of erythropoiesis (15), with the conditional activation of JAK3-dependent pathways.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	340	Finally, we showed that rIL-15 induced the phosphorylation of STAT6 both in leukemic TF1ss proerythroid precursors, and in normal CBPr CD34+/CD56- progenitors.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Our data suggest that this unusual IL-15 to dependent pathway, the activation of which in mast cells was attributed to the high-affinity p65 IL-15RX receptor (28, 29), is also triggered in other types of CD34+ precursor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	342	 However, in TF1ss cells, this pathway is controlled by the classical IL-15R/ss/c receptor and/or by the c/GM-CSFRss hybrid receptor, whereas in normal CBPr, CD34+/CD56- IL-15 to dependent STAT6 phosphorylation is not controlled by the hybrid receptor.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Overall, these results suggest the possible and complex involvement of STAT6 in the control of hematopoiesis (36) and provide further evidence that IL-15/GM-CSF are involved in cross talk.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	344	Recent data have shown that unprimed hematopoietic progenitors secrete several mediators activating autocrine/paracrine regulatory loops (3).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	345	 For instance, CD34+ cells may express GM-CSF transcripts (3) and a biologically active IL-15 that controls expression of the c chain, but is not competent for inducing the spontaneous differentiation of these cells into NK cells (20).
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Thus, IL-15 and GM-CSF may contribute, by means of the hybrid receptor, to the autocrine/paracrine cross talk that controls the development of hematopoietic cells (3), perhaps by inhibiting the spontaneous engagement of these cells in the lymphoid lineage.
0.26340848.12642604.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In contrast, in leukemic hematopoiesis, the action of the hybrid receptor is probably irreversible and may be involved in the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of differentiation in certain leukemic clones.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	7	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Nuclear receptors (NR) activate transcription by interacting with several different coactivator complexes, primarily via LXXLL motifs (NR boxes) of the coactivator that bind a common region in the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors (activation function-2, AF to 2) in a ligand-dependent fashion.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, how nuclear receptors distinguish between different sets of coactivators remains a mystery, as does the mechanism by which orphan receptors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) activate transcription.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In this study, we show that HNF4 interacts with a complex containing vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interacting proteins (DRIPs) in the absence of exogenously added ligand.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, whereas a full-length DRIP205 construct enhanced the activation by HNF4 in vivo, it did not interact well with the HNF4 ligand binding domain in vitro.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In investigating this discrepancy, we found that the polyamine spermine significantly enhanced the interaction between HNF4 and full-length DRIP205 in an AF-2, NR-box-dependent manner.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Spermine also enhanced the interaction of DRIP205 with the VDR even in the presence of its ligand, but decreased the interaction of both HNF4 and VDR with the p160 coactivator glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GR1P1).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We also found that GR1P1 and DRIP205 synergistically activated HNF4-mediated transcription and that a specific inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, -difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), decreased the ability of HNF4 to activate transcription in vivo.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These results lead us to propose a model in which polyamines may facilitate the switch between different coactivator complexes binding to NRs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   NUCLEAR RECEPTORS (NRs) comprise a family of transcription factors that play a role in nearly every aspect of growth, development, and disease processes (reviewed in Refs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The best characterized members of the family, such as the steroid and thyroid hormone and vitamins A and D receptors, are known to regulate transcription by binding their cognate lipophilic ligands and subsequently undergoing a conformational change that alters their ability to interact with coregulatory proteins.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These coregulatory proteins typically consist of complexes that either repress (corepressors) or activate (coactivators) transcription.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The coactivator complexes can be crudely divided into complexes that either contain histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity [e.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	19	 the p160-p300/CBP-PCAF complexes] or ones that do not [e.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	20	 the vitamin D receptor (VDR)-interating protein (DRIP)/thyroid hormone receptor associated protein (TRAP)/ARC/mediator complexes].
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We and others have proposed previously that nuclear receptors interact first with the coactivator complexes that contain HAT activity, allowing for acetylation and hence decondensation of the chromatin, and that subsequently the other coactivator complexes bind the receptors and interact with the basal transcription machinery to initiate transcription (reviewed in Refs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	22	An increasing amount of evidence indicates that both types of coactivators interact with the activation function-2 (AF-2) region of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the NRs via LXXLL motifs (NR interaction regions or NR boxes).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	23	 p160 family members glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC1) bind the AF-2 and help recruit p300/CBP, which has also been found to bind via the AF-2.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	24	 DRIP205 (also known as TRAP220, RB18A, PBP, TRIP2), a component of the DRIP/TRAP complex, also interacts with the AF-2 via LXXLL motifs (6, 7, 8).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, what is not clear is how a given nuclear receptor makes the switch from the p160/p300 complex to the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Whereas the switch from corepressor to coactivator binding is apparently made by a conformational change in the receptor upon ligand binding, both types of coactivators bind liganded receptor and bind principally via the AF-2.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This suggests that perhaps a change not in the receptor but in the coactivators is required to make the switch from one complex to another.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, what might cause that switch is completely unknown at this point.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	29	In an attempt to answer some of these questions, we examined the interaction between an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) and the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	30	 HNF4 is a somewhat unusual receptor in that it activates transcription in a constitutive fashion (i.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Whereas an endogenous ligand has not yet been definitively identified for HNF4 (10, 11), we and others (12, 13, 14, 15, 16) have shown that HNF4 interacts with coactivators GRIP1 and p300/CBP in the absence of added ligand and that transactivation by HNF4 is completely dependent upon the AF-2.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	34	In this study, we show that the HNF4 LBD also interacts with a complex containing DRIP proteins in the absence of exogenously added ligand.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In investigating this interaction, we found that the polyamine spermine enhanced the interaction between DRIP205 and not only the HNF4 but also the VDR LBD.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In contrast, spermine decreased the interaction of both receptors with p160 family member GRIP1.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	37	 These and other results lead us to propose a model in which polyamines such as spermine help promote the switch from the p160/p300 complex to the DRIP complex.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	98	 For example, spermine did not enhance binding of DRIP205.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Spermine also only marginally affected the ability of the HNF4 LBD to interact with another protein, namely 35S-labeled HNF41 (Fig.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The effect of spermine also required the presence of the NR boxes of DRIP205 as pull-downs with the full-length DRIP205 containing mutations in the two NR boxes (DRIP205.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Finally, spermine decreased the interaction of both HNF4 and VDR with coactivator GRIP1, and GRIP1 synergized with DRIP205 in vivo to activate HNF4-mediated transcription (Fig.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Our current work supports that model and allows us to propose a mechanism by which this might occur to namely, that polyamines may play a role in switching from one coactivator complex to the other (Fig.

0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This would allow for a switch between the p160/p300 complex and the DRIP complex, both of which interact with nuclear receptors via a common docking surface, the AF-2 (black dot).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	198	 As described in the text, one potential source of the polyamines could be the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	199	  Polyamines are small, ubiquitous, organic polycations found at relatively high concentrations in the cell, approximately 1 to 2 mM.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	200	 They have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological functions and have been found to bind proteins as well as nucleic acids (reviewed in Refs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Perhaps one of the most intriguing, if elusive, roles of polyamines is in the regulation of gene expression.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Polyamines are implicated in the formation of higher order chromosomal fibers, facilitating condensation of chromatin fragments and interacting specifically with nucleosome core particles and DNA (31).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Whereas this would suggest that an increase in polyamine levels would globally repress transcription, in fact it results in an increase in expression of many genes (32), suggesting that polyamines regulate gene expression by additional mechanisms.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	204	 One such mechanism could be via affecting the interaction of transcriptional activators, such as HNF4, with coactivators, such as the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	205	The data presented in this study indicate that p160 family member GRIP1 and DRIP205 can synergistically activate transcription (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	206	 5B), suggesting that they act in a single pathway but raising the question of how the switch is made from one coactivator to the other.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our data also show that the polyamine spermine can decrease the binding of at least two different nuclear receptors to GRIP1 (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	208	 5A) and can increase the binding to DRIP205 (Figs.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	209	 3 and 4), suggesting that polyamines may play a role in that switch.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Support for that role in vivo is observed when blocking the biosynthesis of polyamines resulted in a decrease in HNF4-mediated transcription (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	211	 If polyamines were acting at the level of chromatin only, and not at the level of coactivators, then one would expect a decrease in polyamine levels to decondense the chromatin and result in an increase, not a decrease, in transcription.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Therefore, the in vivo as well as the in vitro results suggest that polyamines may play a role in transcription activation other than altering the state of the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, it must be noted that other interpretations of the in vivo data are possible and that additional experiments are required to definitively prove that polyamines modulate the synergy between GRIP1 and DRIP205 in vivo.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	214	The model of polyamines playing a role in the switch between different coactivator complexes is intriguing but provocative, and raises several important questions.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	215	 One is how do polyamines affect binding of coactivators to activators? Whereas the mechanism is not known, our results suggest that it is not due to a simple enhancement of the interaction between the AF-2 of the nuclear receptors and the NR boxes of DRIP205 (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Rather, because truncated DRIP205 products bound the HNF4 LBD equally well in the presence and absence of spermine (Fig.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	217	 3), we favor a model in which polyamines induce a conformational change in DRIP205 that exposes otherwise buried NR boxes.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	218	 There is at least one example already of a conformational change in a coactivator that is important for its function (33).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Another important question is where do the polyamines come from? Most of the polyamines in the cell are not free but are bound to negatively charged molecules such as chromatin (28, 29, 30).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Because others have shown that the hyperacetylation of histones inhibits the ability of polyamines to condense the chromatin (31), it is possible that acetylation of histones by coactivators such as p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor may also cause a release of polyamines from the chromatin.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	221	 If this were the case, then upon activator binding DNA and recruiting a HAT-containing coactivator complex, there would be an increase in the local polyamine concentration that could then mediate the switch from the HAT-containing complex to the DRIP complex.
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Some evidence already exists that polyamine levels can affect histone acetylation by influencing the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (32).
0.2994644.12089346.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Finally, an attractive feature of the model is that it could apply not only to nuclear receptors but to any transcriptional activator that recruits both HAT-containing coactivators and the DRIP/TRAP/ARC/mediator complex, of which there are several examples (4, 7).

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The identity box (I-box), a 40-amino acid region within the ligand-binding domains of RXRs and other nuclear receptors, was recently shown to determine identity in the heterodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Here, we dissected this region in the yeast two-hybrid system by analyzing a series of chimeric receptors between human RXR and rat hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), a distinct member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that prefers homodimerization.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	8	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcriptional regulatory proteins linked by conserved structure and function (1).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (2).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (HREs) in promoters of target genes.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to DNA elements.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	12	 While some apparently bind only as homodimers, thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and several orphan nuclear receptors bind their specific response elements with high affinity as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These heterodimers display distinct HRE specificities to mediate the hormonal responsiveness of target gene transcription, in that distinct HREs are comprised of direct repeats (DRs) of a common half-site with variable spacing between repeats playing a critical role in mediating specificity (2, 9).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Accordingly, RARs activate preferentially through DRs spaced by two or five nucleotides, whereas VDR and TR activate through DRs spaced by three and four nucleotides, respectively.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	16	 RXR-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor heterodimers as well as RXR homodimers activate preferentially through DRs spaced by one nucleotide (referred to as DR1).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition to DRs, response elements composed of palindromes as well as inverted palindromes referred to as everted repeats (ER) have been shown to mediate transcriptional activation by RXR-RAR and RXR-TR heterodimeric complexes (9).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Such DNA-binding flexibility stands in contrast to the steroid hormone receptors, which bind exclusively as homodimers to inverted repeats (IR) spaced by three nucleotides (10).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	19	Some orphan nuclear receptors bind DNA as homodimers.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In contrast with the steroid receptor homodimers, orphan receptor homodimers can bind to both palindromic and DR-response elements.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In particular, the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binds as a homodimer to DR1 and is a strong constitutive transcriptional activator (11).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In contrast with HNF4, homodimers of the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) such as EAR2, EAR3, and ARP1 are potent dominant repressors of both basal transcription and transactivation by several receptors, including RXR, RAR, VDR, and TR (12).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Repression of these pathways by COUP-TF is believed to be accomplished in part by direct competitive binding and by the presence of a strong carboxy-terminal repressor domain (13).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Interestingly, COUP-TF has an ability to heterodimerize with RXR, thereby titrating RXR into a transcriptionally inactive complex (14).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	25	A dimerization interface has previously been identified within the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of RXRs, RARs, VDR, and TRs that selectively promotes DNA binding to cognate direct repeat HREs (15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	26	 An additional dimerization interface that mediates cooperative binding to DNA, referred to as the I-box, has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal ligand binding domains (LBDs) of RAR, TR, COUP-TF, and RXR (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, this dimerization motif promotes cooperative binding with similar efficiency to all three classes of repeats, DR, IR, and ER.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The two dimerization domains appear to work in sequence and led to a two-step hypothesis for binding of heterodimers to DNA (2, 21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Accordingly, the LBD dimerization interface initiates the formation of solution heterodimers that, in turn, acquire the capacity to bind to a number of differently organized repeats.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, formation of a second dimer interface within the DBD restricts receptors to bind to DRs.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	31	The I-box sequences are fairly well conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including HNF4, a member of the homodimer subclass (11).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	32	 This led us to test whether the I-box region of the HNF4 plays a similar role in the homodimeric interactions and, more importantly, to determine whether differences between the I-box sequences contribute to the preferences of HNF4 for homodimerization and RXR for heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	33	 To answer these questions without complications associated with HRE binding and the dimerization interface within the DBDs, we exploited the yeast two-hybrid system in which LBDs of nuclear receptors are fused to either the DNA binding domain of the bacterial repressor LexA or the B42 transcriptional activation domain, as previously described (22, 23, 24).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In this report, the HNF4 I-box was found to be sufficient for the homodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In addition, an 11-amino acid subregion within the RXR I-box was found to be essential for the heterodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	36	 From mutational analyses, the RXR amino acids A416 and R421 of the 11-amino acid subregion were also identified as particularly critical determinants of the heterodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	37	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The HNF4 I-Box Is Sufficient to Mediate the Homodimeric Interactions To characterize dimerization properties of nuclear receptors, we exploited the yeast two-hybrid system that has been previously described (22, 23, 24).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In the host strain used in this system, expression of ss-galactosidase (ss-Gal) is controlled by upstream LexA DNA-binding sites (operators).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Thus, this yeast strain depends on transcriptional activation by a LexA protein for expression of ss-Gal.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A series of nuclear receptors were fused to the full-length LexA repressor or the B42 transactivation domain.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	41	 As previously described (23, 24), LexA or its fusions to most nuclear receptors are transcriptionally inactive in yeast.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Protein-protein interactions between nuclear receptors, however, can bring the B42 transactivation domain to the LexA sites and activate the expression of the ss-Gal construct.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The LexA portion of such chimeras contains its own dimerization domain and directs high-affinity binding to the LexA operators as a dimer, regardless of the status of dimerization between nuclear receptors.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Therefore, an important merit of this system is the fact that dimerization properties of nuclear receptors can be directly assessed without complications associated with HRE binding.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, it should be noted that the exact nature of these interactions, for instance as to dimer vs.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	46	A dimerization interface referred to as the I-box has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP, and RXR (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The I-box sequences are moderately conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including the homodimerizing HNF4, leading us to test whether the HNF4 I-box region plays a similar role in the homodimeric interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To this end, we constructed a series of chimeras between HNF4 and RXR.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	49	 PCR was used to construct B42/HNF, a chimeric protein consisting of the B42 transactivation domain fused to the entire hinge and LBDs (D, E and F, amino acids 106 to 455) of the rat HNF4 (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Chimeric receptors B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H/X-338/429, B42/X-HHH, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 were similarly constructed (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Western blot analyses were executed to confirm that expression levels for all the mutants constructed were comparable (data not shown).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	52	 LexA/HNF4 showed some constitutive transcriptional activity in yeast, which was approximately 3.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	53	5-fold higher than that of LexA alone (data not shown).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	54	 1B, coexpression of B42/HNF led to approximately 5.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	55	5-fold enhancement of this constitutive activity, faithfully reflecting the HNF4-HNF4 homodimeric interactions in this yeast system.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Furthermore, coexpression of B42/H/X-338/429 or B42/X-HHH led to approximately 4- and 7-fold enhancements of the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4, respectively.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	57	 In contrast, the RXR I-box could not substitute the HNF4 I-box for the homodimeric interactions, as shown by inabilities of B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 to enhance the transcriptional activity of LexA/HNF4.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These results demonstrate that the HNF4 I-box is indeed a sufficient and transferable interaction interface for the homodimeric interactions.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The result is the average of at least six different experiments, and the SDs are less than 5%.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	69	  As expected, B42/RXR was able to interact with LexA/RAR and LexA/TR (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	70	 1B), and similar results were observed with chimeric receptors containing the RXR I-box sequences such as B42/H/X-298/389, B42/H-XXX, and B42/X/H-428/339 (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In these interactions, LexA/RAR, which includes a full-length RAR in contrast to LexA/TR and other LexA chimeras consisting of only LBDs, shows higher ss-Gal activities than LexA/TR, probably due to the AF1 activation domain in the RAR A/B domains (25).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Since LexA/TR and LexA/RAR show similar basal activities in yeast, this difference results in higher fold-activations with LexA/RAR than LexA/TR.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	73	 For instance, coexpression of B42/RXR conferred approximately 44-fold activation to LexA/RAR and approximately 11-fold activation to LexA/TR (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	74	 It is noteworthy that incorporation of only the RXR I-box sequences conferred to the resulting chimera the ability to heterodimerize with RAR and TR (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	75	 1B, compare interactions with B42/HNF and B42/H-XXX).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Thus, we conclude that the RXR I-box was indeed a transferable interaction interface for heterodimerization, as reported previously (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	77	Localization of a Critical Region of the RXR I-Box for Heterodimerization As shown in Fig.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nevertheless, the HNF4 I-box directs homodimerization, while the RXR I-box directs heterodimerization (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Thus, we set out to dissect the RXR I-box region to identify sequences critical for heterodimerization by sequentially transferring part of the RXR I-box sequences into corresponding regions of the HNF4, or vice versa.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	101	 3B, two things were evident from analyses of these chimeric receptors in the yeast two-hybrid system (22, 23, 24).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	102	 First, none of the chimeric receptors was able to enhance the constitutive transcriptional activities of the LexA/HNF4, demonstrating that substitution of any of these HNF4 subregions with that of the RXR I-box blocked homodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This suggests that important residues for the homodimeric interactions are present throughout the entire HNF4 I-box.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Second, the C-terminal 11-amino acid subregion of the RXR I-box was sufficient to direct chimeric receptors to heterodimerize with RARs or TRs; i.

0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Another dimerization interface referred to as the I-box has recently been mapped to a transferable 40-amino acid region within the carboxy-terminal LBDs of RAR, TR, COUP-TF, and RXR, which mediates cooperative binding to DNA (21).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, this dimerization motif promotes cooperative binding with similar efficiency to all three classes of repeats, DR, IR, and ER.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	159	 In the recently described crystal structure of the RXR LBD (27), a rotationally symmetrical dimerization interface was formed mainly by helix 10 (H10) and, to a lesser extent, helix 9 (H9) and the loop between helix 7 (H7) and helix 8 (H8).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The I-box nicely overlaps with H9 and H10 (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	161	 2), whose sequences are well conserved among a subset of nuclear receptors including HNF4 (11) and COUP-TF (12) that prefer to homodimerize.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	162	 In addition, the crystal structures of RAR and TR LBDs (28, 29) demonstrate that the I-box regions adopt a structure similar to that of the RXR (27) in an overall common fold that can be summarized as an -helical antiparallel sandwich composed of 12 -helices (H1-H12).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	163	 As expected from this common fold and the conservation of the I-box sequences, the HNF4 I-box was expected to play an important role in the HNF4-HNF4 interactions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	164	 1, the HNF4 I-box region is indeed sufficient for the homodimeric interactions (see the results with B42/H/X-338/429 and B42/X-HHH in Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, residues critical for homodimerization are clearly different from those for heterodimerization, since the HNF4-HNF4 interactions were not affected by any of the HNF4 point-mutations replacing the two residues found to be critical for the heterodimeric interactions (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	166	 One potential explanation of the inability of B42/H-HHX and similar mutants (shown in Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	167	 3) to interact with LexA/HNF4 is that the overall structure of the chimeras is disrupted.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, this is ruled out by the ability of the chimeras to interact with LexA/RAR (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	169	The results described here define an 11-amino acid subregion of the I-box as a major determinant of dimerization specificity.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This is consistent with the fact that this subregion is contained within H10 (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	171	 2), a major interface in the recently described crystal structure of the RXR LBD (27) and overlaps with heptad 9 previously shown to be critical for both homo- and heterodimerization of RXR (30, 31, 32).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	172	 We also found that a chimeric RAR construct containing the RXR 11-amino acid subregion readily interacted with RAR, lending further support for the importance of this subregion for the heterodimeric interactions (our unpublished results).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Within this subregion, RXR amino acids A416 and R421 are particularly critical, consistent with the fact that these two residues are conserved between RXR and USP, but not in the homodimerizing HNF4.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	174	 4, HNF4 has glycine and leucine, while COUP-TF has glycine and arginine at these positions, respectively.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In contrast, RAR and TR, heterodimeric partners of RXR, have proline and lysine at these positions.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	176	 As expected, mutant HNF4s incorporating only the RXR A416 or R421 heterodimerized with RAR.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, these and other HNF4 point-mutants we constructed showed distinct interactions with different receptors.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	178	 R331, which resembles COUP-TF at the two target positions, weakly interacted with LexA/RXR (data not shown), consistent with a recent finding in which COUP-TF was shown to have an ability to heterodimerize with RXR (14).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In contrast, PR, which resembles RAR and TR at these positions, did not interact with LexA/RXR (data not shown).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Similarly, AR with the RXR sequences at these two positions interacted less efficiently with LexA/RAR than single mutants A326 or R331 (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Overall, these results suggest that the two residues (RXR A416 and R421) are clearly important for identity in heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Finally, it should be noted that changes of these two residues alone were not sufficient to switch specificity in the dimeric interactions (i.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	183	 from homodimerization to heterodimerization).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The change of specificity in dimerization was achieved with at least three mutations incorporated, as shown by AR-K, which weakly interacts with LexA/RAR, but not with LexA/HNF (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Similarly, all the quadruple mutants changed specificity in dimerization (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	186	 5B; compare results with LexA/HNF4 and LexA/RAR).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It is also noteworthy that the effects of substitutions with the corresponding RXR sequences on the heterodimerizing potential of the resulting HNF4 chimeras are largely accumulative: i.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	188	 A326, R331, AR, AR-K, AR-A, AR-R, and AR-AR show relatively weak fold-activations with LexA/RAR (3- to 7-fold, as shown in Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	189	 5B), while the quadruple mutants AR-KR and AR-KA, as well as the quintuple mutant B42/H-HHX (Fig.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	190	 3B), which incorporates all the five RXR amino acids of the 11-amino acid subregion, showed much stronger fold activations with LexA/RAR (23-, 21-, and 43-fold activations, respectively).
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Accordingly, identity seems to be determined in the context of the overall structures in relation to neighboring residues, rather than solely by nature of the two residues.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In addition, it will be interesting to test effects of the identified mutations in the context of full-length receptors.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	193	In conclusion, we have identified an 11-amino acid subregion of the RXR I-box as a critical domain for the heterodimeric interactions and specifically identified two residues in this subregion as determinants of heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Recently, we introduced random mutations into these two residues of RXR in an effort to make mutant RXR more selective in the process of heterodimerization.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Consistent with the importance of these residues in heterodimerization, we were indeed able to find a series of mutant RXRs with significantly altered specificity (S.
0.43481085.9514150.html.plaintext.txt	196	 To understand in detail how these two residues fit into the overall structure of the I-box in each nuclear receptor and how they direct specificity in dimerization, more mutational studies as well as more structural information will be required.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received for publication, March 29, 2004 , and in revised form, May 25, 2004.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription in response to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone (Dex) requires a distinct arrangement of DNA-response elements and their cognate transcription activators on the gene promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Two of the accessory factor-binding elements involved in the Dex response (gAF1 and gAF3) coincide with the DNA-response elements involved in the RA response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We demonstrate here that the combination of Dex/RA has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in rat hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Reporter gene studies show that the gAF3 element and one of the two glucocorticoid receptor-binding elements (GR1) are most important for this effect.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that when H4IIE cells were treated with Dex/RA, ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor) and glucocorticoid receptors are recruited to this gene promoter, as are the transcription coregulators p300, CREB-binding protein, p/CIP, and SRC-1.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Notably, the recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the PEPCK promoter is increased by the combined Dex/RA treatment compared with Dex or RA treatment alone.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The functional importance of p300 in the Dex/RA response is illustrated by the observation that selective reduction of this coactivator, but not that of CREB-binding protein, abolishes the synergistic effect in H4IIE cells.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Extracellular signals received by eucaryotic cells are transferred to the nucleus where the transcription of specific sets of genes is modulated (1).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The final targets of these signaling pathways are different combinations of transcription factors that bind to DNA-response elements and form various protein-protein interactions on gene promoters and thereby either activate or repress gene transcription.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	14	 DNA-response elements in gene promoters often overlap or are adjacent to one another (2).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This provides various possibilities for the recruitment of transcription factors and their cognate coregulators in response to distinct signals and creates the potential for considerable flexibility in gene regulation.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)1 gene provides an excellent model system for exploring the mechanisms of signal integration in the context of gluconeogenesis, an important physiologic process (2).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The expression of hepatic PEPCK is primarily accomplished at the transcriptional level (3).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Glucagon (acting through cAMP), glucocorticoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), and thyroid hormone activate PEPCK gene expression, whereas insulin and glucose are inhibitory (3 to 6).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	19	Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by RA occurs through a multicomponent retinoic acid-response unit (RARU) that consists of two separate retinoic acid-response elements, RARE1 and RARE2, each of which binds an RAR/RXR heterodimer (4, 7).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Activation of PEPCK gene transcription by Dex also requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid-response unit (GRU), which consists of two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) (8), and four accessory factor-binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, gAF3, and the cAMP-response element (CRE)), which bind COUP-TF/HNF4, HNF3, COUP-TF, and C/EBP, respectively (9 to 12).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50 to 60% reduction of Dex-induced PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (11).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Any combination of the mutation of two elements nearly abolishes this response (11).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	23	Most interesting, RARE1 and RARE2 in the RARU are coincident with gAF1 and gAF3 in the GRU (4, 7, 9, 13).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The respective transcription factors are present in about the same abundance in the H4IIE cell nucleus, and each binds with approximately the same affinity to these elements.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, it is of interest to understand how a cell responds to either of these inducers, whether different constellations of accessory factors and coregulators are used for each response and whether there is any functional interaction between the two units in the presence of both ligands.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	26	In this study, we demonstrate that the Dex/RA combination has a synergistic effect on endogenous PEPCK gene expression in both primary hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This response is most dependent on the gAF3 and GR1 elements.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Upon treatment with Dex/RA, ligand-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers, GR, HNF3, HNF4, p/CIP, SRC-1, CBP, p300, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) are present on the PEPCK gene promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Notably, the recruitment of p300 and pol II on the PEPCK promoter is increased upon Dex/RA treatment.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The important role of p300 is illustrated by the fact that its reduction results in a selective loss of the synergistic effect of Dex/RA, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	295	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The GRU and RARU in the PEPCK gene promoter consist of several overlapping DNA elements, as described in the Introduction.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Although any of these DNA elements and associated factors could be involved in the synergistic action of Dex/RA, it appears that gAF3, and to a lesser extent gAF1, are of most importance, and gAF2 is not involved (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	297	 In particular, the site of gAF3, which binds a RAR/RXR heterodimer, is critical (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The role of RAR/RXR binding is supported by the observation that substitution of an element at gAF1, which selectively binds RAR/RXR, promotes synergism, but elements that selectively bind either HNF4 or COUP-TF, which bind to the wild type gAF1, do not (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Finally, the substitution of a consensus RARE at gAF1 (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	300	 3), and especially at gAF3 (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	301	 5), markedly enhances the synergistic effect; the cRARE at gAF3 results in a 4-fold greater synergistic response than that obtained from the wild type promoter (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	302	The Dex response was reduced by 50 to 60% in the experiment in which a cRARE was substituted for gAF3, which normally binds COUP-TF as an accessory factor in the Dex response (11, 13).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Thus, unliganded RAR/RXR, if bound to the cRARE, cannot serve as an accessory factor for the Dex response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, when RA is added, a robust synergistic effect is obtained, as noted above (and Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Although indirect, this suggests that ligand-bound RAR/RXR can serve as an accessory factor in the Dex response.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	306	The role of the accessory factors at gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 (HNF4/COUP-TF, HNF3, and COUP-TF, respectively) is to increase the affinity of binding of GR to the GR1 element (21).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Thus, when GR1 is converted to a high affinity site, gAF1 and gAF3 have no additional effect on GR binding (21).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Likewise, when GR1 is converted to a palindromic GRE, PEPCK gene expression is at the maximal rate, and there is no additional or synergistic effect of RA (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	309	It is reasonable to presume that Dex and RA each induce the formation of unique transcription complexes and that the combination of Dex/RA results in yet another complex.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	310	 We began an exploration of this topic by using the ChIP assay.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	311	 As noted previously (18), GR is absent from the PEPCK gene promoter in the absence of ligand.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The addition of Dex results in a 13-fold increase in GR occupancy on the promoter (Table I).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Small amounts of RAR and RXR appear on the promoter in the absence of ligand; a 2 to 2.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	314	5-fold increase in the binding of both occurs after the addition of RA.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Interestingly, the Dex/RA combination has no effect on RAR and RXR occupancy, but GR binding increases from 13- to 21-fold.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	316	 This is in concert with the observation that RAR/RXR acts as an accessory factor to increase the affinity of GR binding and to enhance transcription (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The occupancy of the accessory factors HNF4 and HNF3 is not affected by any treatment, as noted previously (18).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	318	The promoter occupancy of PCAF, SRC-1, p/CIP, p300, and CBP was analyzed under the various hormone treatments.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	319	 There was no binding of PCAF under any of the treatment conditions (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	320	 This was somewhat surprising in view of the observations that RA-activated RAR/RXR heterodimers recruit PCAF to DNA segments that contain the typical DR5 RARE in vitro (26).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	321	 RA and Dex each recruit p/CIP and SRC-1; however, there is no additional binding when the Dex/RA combination is employed.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Indeed, the binding of these p160 family members is the same in Dex/RA as in Dex-only treated cells (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	323	 A different pattern was noted with CBP.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	324	 RA treatment resulted in more recruitment of CBP than did Dex treatment, and the Dex/RA level was equivalent to that of RA alone.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	325	 The most interesting observation concerns the binding of p300 to the PEPCK gene promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	326	 RA and Dex each increase the binding of p300 by 2-fold; however, the combination results in about a 5-fold increase (Fig.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	327	 A similar quantitative change occurs with the binding of pol II to the promoter (Table I).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	328	 In concert with this observation, McGrane and co-workers (27) recently showed that pol II association with the PEPCK gene promoter is reduced in vitamin A-deficient mice.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	329	A key role for p300 in the synergistic action of Dex/RA was established by selectively reducing the cellular levels of p300 and CBP by siRNA.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Elimination of either had no effect on the RA response, whereas both reduced the Dex effect by about 50%.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The absence of CBP had no effect on the synergistic effect of the Dex/RA combination, but removal of p300 abolished the response (Fig.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Although encoded by different genes, they have several functional domains in common.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	334	 The designation CBP/p300 implies a common overall function; however, recent reports (28) suggest each may govern unique cellular events.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	336	 By contrast, the selective reduction of p300 makes F9 cells resistant to RA-induced differentiation, whereas a similar reduction of CBP has no effect (29).
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	337	The linear increase of the recruitment of p300 and pol II in conjunction with a nonlinear increase of the transcription response is not unexpected.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Veitia (30) has explained this in the context of a series of cooperative interactions between promoter elements/enhancers and transcription factors with a succession of coregulator proteins and ultimately the basal transcription apparatus.

0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	353	 6), which elicits an exaggerated response from this otherwise wild type promoter.
0.21842672.15166231.html.plaintext.txt	354	 When considered in the context of the MCD, the PEPCK gene promoter may have evolved to have a weak GRE (GR1) which, when combined with the variety of other elements and cognate transcription factors described above, allows for a graduated response between off and fully on and therefore a very flexible means of adjusting the rate of gluconeogenesis.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	4	Received June 18, 2003; Revised August 25, 2003;.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) is central to hepatocyte and pancreatic ss-cell functions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Along with retinoid X receptor (RXR), HNF4 belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2), characterised by a conserved arginyl residue and a glutamate residue insert in helix 7 (H7) of the ligand binding domain (LBD).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Crystallographic studies indicate that R348 and E352 residues in RXR H7 are involved in charge-driven interactions that improve dimerisation.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Consistent with these findings, we showed that removing the charge of the corresponding residues in HNF4 H7, R258 and E262, impaired dimerisation in solution.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, our results provide a new concept according to which helices of the HNF4 LBD dimerisation interface contribute differently to dimerisation required for DNA binding; unlike H9 and H10, H7 is not involved in DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Substitutions of E262 decreased the repression of HNF4 transcriptional activity by a dominant-negative HNF4 mutant, highlighting the importance of this residue for dimerisation in the cell context.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The E262 insert is crucial for HNF4 function since its deletion abolished HNF4 transcriptional activity and coactivator recruitment.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The glutamate residue insert and the conserved arginyl residue in H7 most probably represent a signature of the NR2 subfamily of nuclear receptors.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 is a transcription factor encoded by two genes, HNF4 and HNF4, leading to two subtypes of proteins: HNF4 (NR2A1) and HNF4 (NR2A2) (1).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	14	 HNF4 is central to embryogenesis (2,3) and is required for the normal function of hepatocytes and pancreatic ss-cells (4,5).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	15	 HNF4 occupies a key position in a complex transcription factor network and directly regulates the expression of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of various nutrients, as well as that of genes coding for serum proteins (1).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	16	 HNF4 is linked to human diseases: mutations in HNF4 response elements in promoters of factors VII and IX are correlated with haemophilia, while mutations in the HNF4 gene have been found in patients carrying the syndrome of maturity onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1) (1,6).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	17	Like other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, HNF4 has a modular structure consisting of functional domains (7).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Two of these domains, the DNA binding domain (DBD) and the ligand binding domain (LBD) are involved in dimerisation of HNF4, which behaves as a homodimer (8).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Dimerisation via the DBD is involved in HNF4 dimerisation on DNA, whereas dimerisation via the LBD is essential for dimerisation in solution and strongly stabilises the HNF4 to DNA complex (9,10).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The LBD is also involved in other functions, including transcriptional activation and interaction with transcriptional partners.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Both domains are well conserved in HNF4 (11).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Crystal structures of the LBDs of HNF4 and HNF4 have recently been resolved (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These LBDs adopt the canonical fold of -helices (10 helices numbered H1 to H12 to follow the conventional nomenclature) and ss-sheets arranged as an antiparallel -helical  sandwich  in a three-layer structure shared with the LBD of other nuclear receptors (14).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The LBD structures of HNF4 and HNF4 are very similar and closely resemble that of RXR, another member of the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Indeed, 194 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	26	26 A and 223 core carbons of the LBD of HNF4 and RXR superimpose with a r.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In these structures, the LBD dimerisation interface is made of residues in helices 7 (H7), 9 (H9) and 10 (H10), the major part of the interface being made up of H10.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	28	HNF4 and HNF4, which activate transcription in the absence of exogenous ligands, are considered to be constitutive transcriptional activators (1,11,13,15,16).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Their LBDs are tightly associated with endogenous fatty acids, which do not act as classical ligands but are likely required for the stability of the protein conformation (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	30	 HNF4 transcriptional activity can be enhanced by other transcription factors, including COUP-TF (17), Smad3 and Smad4 (18), or by coactivators, such as members of the p160 family (19,20), CBP/p300 (20 to 22) and PGC-1 (23).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The HNF4 transcriptional activity can also be repressed by negative transcriptional partners such as SHP (24), p53 (25) and SMRT (26).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	32	In the crystal structure of the RXR LBD, H7 adopts an unusual -helical geometry that forces the glutamic acid residue in position 352 to bulge outward from the H7 axis (27).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This structure gives rise to the formation of a series of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds that improve RXR LBD homodimerisation (27).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In particular, residues E352 and R348 are directly involved in the dimerisation interface by forming charge-driven interactions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The -helical conformation near E352 in the RXR homodimer and the resulting interactions were also observed in the PPAR/RXR LBD heterodimer (28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Sequence alignment indicates that a glutamic acid residue and an arginyl residue are also encountered at the equivalent positions in human and rat HNF4 (E262 and R258).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Figure 1 shows that these residues are conserved in remote species such as Drosophila and in the Xenopus HNF4ss and are specifically encountered in members of the NR2 subfamily (27 to 29).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, in the crystal structure of the HNF4 LBD, a bulge near E262 was also observed in H7 (12).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	39	 described this glutamate as a single residue E insert in H7 and hypothesised that it may play a crucial role in the function of nuclear receptors belonging to the NR2 subfamily, including HNF4 (27,28).

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	93	 1) may facilitate RXR dimerisation (i) because of the -helix conformation its insertion generates and (ii) because of its carboxylic group, which forms a salt bridge and hydrogen bonds (27,28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	94	 A similar conformation was observed near the corresponding E262 residue in the HNF4 LBD (12).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	95	 We investigated the role of this glutamate residue in HNF42 dimerisation.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	96	 To this end, the HNF42 E262 residue was deleted in construct HNF42-E262 and its charge was inverted in construct HNF42-E262K and removed in constructs HNF42-E262A and HNF42-E262M, the bulk of the residue being conserved in the latter mutation.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	97	We analysed whether these mutations affected the ability of labelled HNF42 mutants to form dimers in solution with wild-type HNF42 (HNF42 WT).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Dimerisation was studied by either co-immunoprecipitation assays using c-myc-HNF42 WT or GST pull-down assays using GST-HNF42 WT.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	99	 As expected, HNF42 WT efficiently bound to both c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Conversely, all mutants failed to bind efficiently to c-myc-HNF42 WT (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Next, we analysed the effects of mutations on dimerisation of a given mutant with itself.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	102	 For these assays, we focused on mutants E262A and E262.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In co-immunoprecipitation assays, no dimer was detectable with either E262A or E262 (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This result was not due to a lower expression of mutated c-myc-HNF42 (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Impaired dimerisation of mutants was confirmed by pull-down experiments performed in increasingly stringent conditions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	106	 HNF42 WT dimerisation was unaltered at 300 mM KCl and decreased by only 25% at 600 mM KCl (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	124	  In RXR, R348 is also involved in dimerisation (27,28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Interestingly, this arginyl residue is specifically conserved in all members of the NR2 subfamily (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	126	 This led us to investigate the role of the corresponding R258 residue of HNF42 in dimerisation.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	127	 When the positive charge of this residue was removed in the R258M mutant, HNF4 dimerisation dropped (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Together, these results show the involvement of the charged groups of residues E262 and R258 in the stabilisation of HNF42 dimerisation in solution.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	130	Mutations of residues E262 and R258 do not impair DNA binding Since HNF4 is known to bind DNA as a homodimer (8), we analysed the effect of E262 and R258 mutations on HNF42 DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Surprisingly, none of the mutations altered HNF42 binding to the HNF4 response element of the HNF1 promoter (HNF1 site, Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The specificity of the band shift was ascertained by supershifting it with HNF4 antiserum 455 (33) (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Similar results were obtained on another HNF4 response element, site B of the apoCIII promoter (CIIIB site), which is also a direct repeat 1 (DR1) (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	134	 3E, results in the absence of competitor).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Results obtained with increasing amounts of labelled probe exclude that lack of detection of DNA binding impairment by E262A mutation was due to saturated binding (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Similar results were obtained with other mutants (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Mutated and wild-type HNF4 yielded a retarded band of identical intensity and electrophoretic mobility.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	138	 More specifically, we did not observe a band of higher mobility corresponding to a HNF4 monomer bound to DNA as observed for the RAR monomer (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In addition, to rule out the possibility that mutants bound to DNA as two adjacent monomers, we performed EMSA with the HNF1 mt site containing one mutated half-site and obtained no binding of the mutants (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Thus, HNF4 mutants, like wild-type HNF4, bind DNA as homodimers.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	141	 To evidence possibly diminished interactions with DNA, we performed EMSA in less-favorable conditions.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	142	 First, we increased the ionic strength (300 versus 100 mM KCl in Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	143	 3A) in EMSA but found no difference in DNA binding between wild-type and mutated HNF4 (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Second, we carried out competition experiments with COUP-TFII, which binds to several HNF4 response elements.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The rationale here was to check whether this nuclear receptor impinges on DNA binding of HNF42-E262A more efficiently than on wild-type HNF42.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In these assays, the truncated COUP-TFII AB was used to distinguish complexes formed with either HNF42 or COUP-TFII.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	147	 EMSA was performed on the CIIIB site since COUP-TFII does not bind to the HNF1 site (17,30).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	148	 COUP-TFII AB similarly competed for HNF42 WT and -E262A DNA binding (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Also, unlabelled DNA competed equally for DNA binding of both proteins (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In addition, we observed that mutations did not alter binding to a direct repeat 2 (DR2), to which HNF4 binds less efficiently than to a DR1 (9) (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	151	 It appears therefore that the E262 residue does not play a significant role in HNF42 DNA binding.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The I-box almost perfectly overlaps H9 and H10 that form the major portion of the dimer interface in RXR and HNF4 homodimers (12,13,27,36).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Mutagenesis studies also showed that the HNF4 I-box is an important interaction interface for homodimerisation in solution (37) and is likely involved in DNA binding (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	168	 We therefore compared the effects of mutations in H7 and H10 on HNF4 dimerisation in solution and DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Until now, the role of the HNF4 I-box has been studied using multiple (double, triple or quadruple) mutations (15,37).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	170	 For example, the K300E-E327K HNF4 double mutant was used to show the involvement of the salt bridge between these residues in the exclusive homodimerisation of HNF4 (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	171	 For our comparative study, we chose a single mutation located in H10 E327M.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In co-immunoprecipitation assays with c-myc-HNF42 WT, we observed that the E327M mutation decreased HNF42 dimerisation in solution by 25% (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The extent of this decrease was similar to that observed for the R258M mutation (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	174	 A similar drop in HNF42 dimerisation in solution with E327M and R258M mutations was also observed in GST pull-down assays (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Note that the impairment of dimerisation by the E262 mutations was stronger, as observed in both co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The stronger effect of the E262A mutation on HNF42 dimerisation in solution was confirmed by a different co-immunoprecipitation assay, where unlabelled HNF42 WT, -R258M, -E262A or -E327M and the 455 antiserum raised against their common C-terminus were used to co-immunoprecipitate labelled HNF43, which contains a different C-terminus not recognised by this antiserum.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	177	 R258M, E262A and E327M mutations strongly impaired the ability of HNF42 to interact with HNF43 (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	197	  In contrast to E262A and R258M mutations, the E327M mutation moderately but significantly decreased HNF42 DNA binding to the HNF1 site (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	200	 It has previously been shown that the impaired DNA binding of HNF4 mutants (i.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	201	 K300E-E327K and R154X) due to decreased dimerisation could be rescued in the presence of antibodies, which facilitate dimerisation.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This phenomenon is likely due to the bivalency of antigen recognition by antibodies (15,32).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Conversely, when decreased DNA binding is not due to a loss of dimerisation, DNA binding is not recovered in the presence of antibodies, as observed for the D126Y and D126H HNF4 mutants (38).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Therefore, the decreased DNA binding and impaired dimerisation of the E327M mutant are directly correlated.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	205	 E327M mutation also impaired HNF42 DNA binding to the CIIIB site and to the synthetic DR2 site (data not shown).

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The loss of activation by HNF42-E262 was neither due to a lower protein expression, as controlled by western blotting (Fig.

0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	241	  To gain further insight into the consequences of altered dimerisation of HNF4 by substitution mutations, we took advantage of the fact that a truncated HNF4 lacking the AF-2 activation function module (HNF4-AF-2, left part of Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	242	 5F) exhibits a dominant-negative effect through its ability to dimerise with the wild-type protein (7).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In a first set of experiments, we compared HNF4-AF-2 repression on the transcriptional activities of wild-type HNF4 and of the two mutants E262A and E262K.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The rationale was that the dominant-negative mutant would exhibit a weaker repression on mutant HNF4, with impaired dimerisation, than on wild-type HNF4.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	245	 HNF4-AF-2 reduced the activity of wild-type HNF4 by 50% while it reduced that of E262A and E262K mutants by 29 and 26%, respectively (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Accordingly, compared to HNF4-AF-2, HNF4-AF-2 bearing the E262A mutation (HNF4-AF-2-E262A) exhibited a weaker repressive activity on the wild-type protein.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Indeed, HNF4-AF-2 reduced the wild-type HNF4-mediated activation of transcription by 50% while HNF4-AF-2-E262A reduced it by 30% (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	248	 By demonstrating that substitution mutations of E262 affect repression of HNF4-mediated activation of transcription, our results highlight the importance of this residue for dimerisation in a cell context.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	249	The E262 insert is required for efficient recruitment of coactivators by HNF4 Next, we investigated the effects of the mutations on the physical interaction between HNF42 and its transcriptional coactivators.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In this study we included interaction with COUP-TFII, which acts as an HNF4 transcriptional partner on the HNF1 promoter (17).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	251	 GST pull-down assays showed that E262 deletion markedly impaired HNF42 interaction with SRC-1a, p300, PGC-1 and COUP-TFII, whereas substitution mutations of E262 did not alter these interactions (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In line with these data, enhancement of HNF42 transcriptional activity on the HNF1 promoter by p300 or COUP-TFII was not altered by substitution mutations but was abolished by the E262 deletion, as evidenced by transient transfection assays (Fig.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Deletion of the E262 residue also disrupted the functional cooperation between HNF42 and SRC-1a (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	254	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We observed that two charged residues located in H7 of the HNF4 LBD, i.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	255	 R258 and E262, are involved in HNF4 dimerisation in solution.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We failed to detect significant impairment of DNA binding of their substitution mutants.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	257	 At first glance, this may seem striking, since dimerisation via the LBD is thought to be crucial for strong HNF4 DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	258	 However, the accuracy of our findings is verified by the fact that (i) results obtained by various pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays all converge and (ii) the same methods and EMSA allowed us to detect the expected impairments due to the E327M mutation located in H10.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	259	 In addition, our results are in agreement with recent crystallographic studies of the HNF4 LBD, which indicate that H7, together with H9 and H10, constitute the dimerisation interface of this nuclear receptor (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The interest of our work was to describe the critical role of the charge of R258 and E262 residues in dimerisation in solution of HNF4, a role suggested by Gampe et al.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	261	 from the crystal structure of RXR (27,28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Mutants of nuclear receptors that are deficient in dimerisation in solution after in vitro analysis but still able to efficiently bind DNA have already been described (39 to 41).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	263	 To explain the behaviour of several of these mutants, it was suggested that dimers were stabilised on DNA via the DBD dimerisation interface.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	264	 However, such a hypothesis is unlikely here since the E327M mutation impaired DNA binding in spite of its lower effect on dimerisation in solution than E262 mutations.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	265	 A more probable explanation of the efficient DNA binding of H7 mutants is that the HNF4 dimerisation interface is improved by a DNA binding-induced conformational change of the LBD.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	266	 An allosteric effect of DNA, which modulated HNF4 recruitment of co-repressors, has recently been documented (42).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	267	 We also observed an allosteric effect of DNA that most likely occurs in the LBD and modulates coactivator recruitment (data not shown).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	268	Like the substitution mutants in H7, several missense HNF4 mutants, including naturally occurring mutants associated with diabetes (6,30,38), also exhibit unaltered or slightly impaired transcriptional activities in transient transfection assays.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Failure to detect a subtle loss of HNF4 function in these assays where the protein is overexpressed does not exclude that these mutations may have greater consequences on HNF4 function when the protein is expressed at normal levels.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Interestingly, a significant effect of substitution mutants in H7 on HNF4 transcriptional activity could be detected by analysing the repression of this activity with an HNF4 mutant exhibiting a dominant-negative activity.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	271	 These results demonstrate the importance of E262 for HNF4 dimerisation in a cell context.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Moreover, it should be kept in mind that the activity of nuclear receptors can be repressed by proteins that prevent their dimerisation (43,44).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	273	 HNF4 is a target of AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits HNF4 activity by decreasing its dimerisation (45).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The ability of HNF4 to form a highly stable homodimer in solution (8) is likely crucial in this type of repressive mechanism that does not exclusively occur on DNA.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Other pathways that do not necessarily require DNA binding include cross-regulatory mechanisms in which nuclear receptors are frequently involved.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In these mechanisms, dimerisation can be of major importance (46).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Since HNF4 is known to interact with numerous other transcription factors, including Smad proteins (18), it likely participates in cross-regulatory pathways.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Therefore, involvement of H7 residues in dimerisation in solution may be crucial in HNF4 biological activities.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	279	Results obtained with the deletion mutant HNF4-E262 indicate that the E insert is required for HNF4 transcriptional activity and recruitment of transcriptional partners.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Note that, probably due in part to its impaired dimerisation, HNF4-E262 did not exhibit a dominant-negative activity.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	281	 None of the MODY1-associated HNF4 mutants can repress wild-type HNF4 activity (6).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Even single or double mutations in the AF-2 module, which is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity, do not result in a dominant-negative effect (J.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	283	Eeckhoute, unpublished results).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Interestingly, HNF4-D261, a mutant having a deletion of the neighbouring residue, exhibited an abolished transcriptional activity but an unaltered DNA binding (EMSA data not shown), a behaviour that is very similar to that of the E262 mutant.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These findings may be explained by the loss of the special conformation (the -helix) in H7, which was hypothesised to result from the presence of an additional residue, the  E insert  (28).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	286	 The D261 and E262 deletions most probably modify the orientation of the side chain of residues in H7.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Several residues in H7 point towards the HNF4 ligand binding pocket and probably participate in fatty acid binding, which is required for the stability and function of HNF4 and HNF4 (12,13).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The marked decrease in HNF4 transcriptional activity and recruitment of transcriptional partners caused by the E262 deletion may reflect the alteration in fatty acid binding secondary to the loss of the -helix conformation generated by this glutamate residue.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	289	From a mechanistic point of view, our results unravel distinct contributions of H7, H9 and H10 to HNF4 dimerisation and DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	290	 H9 and H10 constitute the core of the LBD dimerisation interface of several non-steroid nuclear receptors (27,36,47,48).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	291	 This core is required for efficient DNA binding (35).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	292	 In HNF4, this core is also involved in dimerisation required for DNA binding, as evidenced using a double mutation in H9 and H10 (15).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	293	 We observed that a single mutation in H10, E327M, was sufficient to alter HNF4 dimerisation and DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	294	 The role of H7 in nuclear receptors has been less extensively studied and only recent crystallographic data indicate that its contribution to dimerisation varies according to the receptor and, for RXR, with its homodimeric or heterodimeric state (47).
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Concerning HNF4, our results clearly show that H7 has a crucial role in dimerisation in solution but does not contribute to the dimerisation activity required for DNA binding.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	296	In conclusion, our results demonstrate the key role of H7 in HNF4 dimerisation in solution and provide a new concept by which helices of the HNF4 LBD dimerisation interface contribute differently to the dimerisation required for DNA binding: whereas H9 and H10 are required for DNA binding, H7 is involved solely in dimerisation in solution.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Our data also show the key role of the E262 insert that causes a special conformation in H7 observed in both RXR and HNF4.
0.49352923.14602925.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The key role of this glutamate is likely shared by other members of the NR2 subfamily, where it is specifically encountered, and most probably the E insert corresponds to a signature of this subfamily.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Expression of COUP-TFII persists throughout postnatal life in various tissues including the female reproductive tract.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the physiological function of COUP-TFII in female reproduction has not been extensively analyzed.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Here, we provide phenotypic evidences that haploinsufficiency of COUP-TFII in mice demonstrates an important role of COUP-TFII for normal female reproduction.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   CHICKEN OVALBUMIN upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs; NRF2) are orphan members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily (1).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Two highly conserved COUP-TF genes, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, have been identified in mammals (1).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Biochemical studies showed that these proteins bind promiscuously to direct repeat motifs, with preference of DR1 sequences and can negatively or positively regulate a large number of genes (2).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The expression patterns of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are distinctly different.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	20	 COUP-TFI is expressed at high levels in the neural system, whereas COUP-TFII is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing organs (3).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Consistent with their expression pattern, deletion of the COUP-TFI in mice results in perinatal lethality with mutants exhibiting neuronal deficits (4, 5, 6).

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Upon analyzing the mating patterns of COUP-TFII +/ to  mice, we found that the COUP-TFII +/ to  females have reduced reproductive function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	29	 COUP-TFII +/ to  female mice exhibited reduced fecundity characterized by reduced litter size, and genotype-dependent reduction in growth in the progeny.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Because normal female reproduction requires functional coordination throughout female hypothalamo-hypophyeal-ovarian endocrine axis, as well as an endocrinological link between ovary and uterus, subtle defects in multiple organs of this axis, could significantly alter the normal reproduction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Therefore, we investigated the ovarian and uterine physiology of the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice to determine the cause of this reduction in female fecundity.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse showed normal ovulation of oocytes but demonstrated a reduced capability for synthesizing sex steroid hormones.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This reduction is due to the reduction of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes important for P4 synthesis and the reduction of vascularization in COUP-TFII heterozygotes.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Analysis of uterine function in the COUP-TFII +/ to  mice was accomplished by assaying the response of the uterus to an endocrine induction of the decidual reaction.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This altered reproductive performance is seen as a delay in puberty and an age-dependent reduction in litter size.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Haploinsufficient phenotypes are rarely reported or result in subtle phenotypes.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This phenomenon usually results if the gene in question is subject to imprinting or holds a rate limiting step in a pivotal pathway.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The above COUP-TFII haploinsufficient phenotype is independent of the parent transmitting the mutant allele (data not shown).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Therefore, imprinting of the COUP-TFII allele is not the cause of this phenotype.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The expression level of COUP-TFII is reduced to about half as measured by Western blot analysis, corresponding to a loss of a single allele in the COUP-TFII+/ to .
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The reduction of COUP-TFII expression could affect the function of the reproductive axis.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Because female reproduction is regulated by interactions in the endocrine system at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary and uterus and expression of COUP-TFII was found in hypothalamus (VMH), theca cells, and the uterine endometrial stroma, it is not surprising that haploinsufficiency reproductive phenotype is seen in COUP-TFII heterozygous females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	210	There is abundant expression of COUP-TFII in the VMH of the central nervous system.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Although the significance of VMH expression is not clear, several of the observed haploinsufficiency phenotypes (e.

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, there was no significant decrease in IGF-I in heterozygotes (data not shown), which is indicative of other potential growth perturbation.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	214	 COUP-TFII has been implicated to interfere with the function of the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) (11).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	215	 SF1 null mice resulted in defective development of VMH (12).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Rescue experiments using SF1 null mutants indicated SF1 functions in VMH to regulate late onset obesity (13).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus, it might be interesting to speculate that COUP-TFII and SF1 reciprocally regulate growth in VMH.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Future specific deletion of COUP-TFII could elucidate this aspect of COUP-TFII function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	219	Although the role of COUP-TFII in the VMH is speculative, the role of COUP-TFII in the ovary was investigated.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	220	 COUP-TFII mice did not demonstrate impairment in ovulation but did show impairment in the ability of P4 production.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The reduced capability to synthesize P4 in response to exogenous gonadotropin suggests potential defects in the ovarian function of COUP-TFII +/ to .

0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The high expression of COUP-TFII in the theca cells, but not in granulosa cells, suggests COUP-TFII might be involved in a steroidogenic pathway, or it might have a significant role during vascularization of the corpus luteum.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Here, we showed that vascularization as measured by PECAM immunostaining is perturbed in COUP-TFII +/ to  mice as compared with the controls.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This might lead to inefficient delivery of LDL to the large luteal cells resulting in the reduced ability of the corpus luteum to synthesize P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In addition, we also show that the expression levels of mRNA of CYP11a1, HSD3b1, and StAR are significantly reduced in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	229	 All of these genes are important for the biosynthesis of P4.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Thus, the reduction in the expression of these genes will directly contribute to the observable reduced P4 levels in the COUP-TFII+/ to  female mice, and the decrease in circulating P4 in pregnant COUP-TFII +/ to  females might result in the reduced ability of the uterus to support pregnancy.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	231	The reduced levels of P4 in early pregnancy may impact on COUP-TFII expression in the uterus during early pregnancy.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Analysis of the expression of COUP-TFII in the uterus shows that E2 treatment caused drastic decrease of COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma, whereas P4 treatment with E2 attenuates E2 action, restoring COUP-TFII expression in the stroma.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	233	 COUP-TFII expression was low after treatment with PMSG, which induces ovarian E2 synthesis, and COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma increased expression after hCG, which induces ovarian P4, are consistent with steroid hormone regulation in hormone-treated ovariectomized females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The lower levels of P4 in the COUP-TFII +/ to  mouse combined with the loss of one COUP-TFII allele in the uterine stromal cell may be the partial cause of the haploinsufficient decrease in uterine function in these mice.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	235	 However, reduced uterine stromal cell function was still observed after exogenous administration of P4 indicating that part of the haploinsufficient phenotype is specific to the uterus.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	236	During implantation, the endometrial stromal cells undergo a series of complex processes called decidualization (14, 15).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The process of decidualization involves concurrent cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as angiogenesis.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Based on our findings, it is evident that uterine function is significantly affected in COUP-TFII heterozygous females.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The relatively high expression of COUP-TFII in endometrial stromal cells, the steroid regulation of COUP-TFII expression in the endometrial stroma, and the reduced decidual cell reaction all support this notion.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Identification of the role of COUP-TFII in the process of decidualization may be discerned from the analysis of what other genes have been shown to regulate this process.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	241	Several targeted null mutant mice, including progesterone receptor (PR) (16), Hoxa-10 (17), and 11 (18) exhibited defects in decidual cell reaction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Consistent with the notion that P4 is required for decidualization in human endometrium, decidual cell reaction was absent in PRKO female mice (16).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	243	 One of the potential key genes that are regulated by P4 is Indian hedgehog (IHH) (8), a well-known morphogen.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Hedgehog signaling is known to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development (19).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The fact that IHH is expressed at preimplantation endometrial epithelial cells and its expression is rapidly induced by P4 (8) further implicates its role in mediating PR function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Importantly, it has been demonstrated that COUP-TFII is regulated by hedgehog signaling (20).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	247	 One of the intriguing possibilities is that P4 regulates IHH in the luminal epithelium, priming stroma cells for decidualization.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	248	 COUP-TFII, a downstream target of IHH could mediate IHH signaling in the endometrium during periimplantation (8).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Importantly, both IHH and COUP-TFII had been implicated in angiogenesis (7, 21).
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	250	 It is our speculation that during artificially induced decidualization or repeated remodeling of endometrium after first conception, normal vascularization is moderately, but functionally significantly affected by COUP-TFII.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	251	Taken together, phenotypic analysis using the haploinsufficiency model of COUP-TFII indicated several functions of this gene in the female reproductive tract.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Combination of those haploinsufficiency phenotypes throughout the female reproductive axis might additively affect female reproductive function.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Although use of this model might be limited for overall phenotypic analysis, it, perhaps, could reveal the global impact of a gene dosage effect (as in human genetic conditions) on female reproduction.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	254	 We propose that COUP-TFII plays an important role in the endometrial stroma during the periimplantation period.
0.2717503.15890675.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms could be elucidated by conditional gene targeting approaches, such as using endometrial-specific Cre recombinase.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received June 11, 1998; Revised and Accepted October 15, 1998.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	4	COUP-TF II is an orphan nuclear receptor that has no known ligand in the `classical sense'.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	5	 COUP-TF interacts with the corepressors N-CoR, SMRT and RIP13, and silences transcription by active repression and trans-repression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Forced expression of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF II in mouse C2 myogenic cells has been demonstrated to inhibit morphological differentiation, and to repress the expression of: (i) the myoD gene family which encodes myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins; and (ii) the cell cycle regulator, p21Waf-1/Cip-1.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In the present study, we show that COUP-TF II efficiently inhibits the myoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential C3H10T1/2 cells by post-transcriptional mechanisms.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Furthermore, repression of MyoD-dependent transcription by COUP-TF II occurs in the absence of the nuclear receptor cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The inhibition of MyoD-mediated trans-activation involves the direct binding of the DNA binding domain/C-region and hinge/D-regions [i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	10	 amino acid (aa) residues 78-213] of COUP-TF II to the N-terminal activation domain of MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Over-expression of the cofactor p300, which functions as a coactivator of myoD-mediated transcription, alleviated repression by COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Further binding analysis demonstrated that COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal 149 aa residues of p300 which encoded the receptor interaction domain of the coactivator.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally we observed that COUP-TF II, MyoD and p300 interact in a competitive manner, and that increasing amounts of COUP-TF II have the ability to reduce the interaction between myoD and p300 invitro.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The experiments presented herein suggest thatCOUP-TF II post-transcriptionally regulates myoD activity/function, and that crosstalk between orphan nuclear receptors and the myogenic bHLH proteins has functional consequences for differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	15	The process of skeletal muscle differentiation involves the activation and induction of a large array of muscle-specific genes, and exit from the cell cycle.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The myoD gene family encodes myogenic specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that activate and control this process (reviewed in 1-3).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	17	 MyoD plays a dual role during myogenesis, activating both muscle specific gene transcription and promoting cell cycle exit by inducing the expression of p21Cip-1/Waf-1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and cellular proliferation (4-6).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Transactivation by MyoD involves: (i) the bHLH domain, that is involved in both DNA binding and dimerisation; (ii) the heterodimerisation of MyoD with the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products, E12 and E47 (7); (iii) the binding of MyoD-E2A heterodimers to specific E-box motifs (CANNTG) in muscle-specific enhancers (reviewed in 1-3); and (iv) the recruitment of the cofactors p300 and PCAF (8-10).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The cofactors p300 and PCAF are critical coactivators for MyoD during myogenic commitment and differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The N-terminal acid-rich activation domain of MyoD directly interacts with p300 and recruits PCAF to form a ternary multimeric complex on promoter elements (8,11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These events lead to hyper-acetylated and transcriptionally-permissive chromatin.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Moreover, p300 and PCAF coactivate myoD-mediated trans-activation of the p21 gene, and are necessary for MyoD-mediated cell cyle arrest (11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	23	The transcriptional activity of MyoD is modulated by environmental cues related to the concentration of growth factors, receptors and oncogene products which promote cell division (reviewed in 12).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These agents inhibit the transcriptional activity of MyoD by promoting: (i) the direct phosphorylation of the bHLH region and/or the interaction with c-jun, which prevent DNA binding; (ii) the activation of inhibitor of differentiation expression (Id), a bHLH protein that lacks DNA binding ability, and functions as a dominant negative; and (iii) the suppression/sequestering of myogenic specific transcription factors and cofactors.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	25	The orphan nuclear receptors COUP-TF II, Rev-erbA and RVR are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and are abundantly expressed in proliferating myoblasts (12-15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, the expression of this group of receptors is repressed during differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Constitutive expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C2 myogenic cells blocks morphological differentiation by suppressing the levels of myoD mRNA, increasing cyclin D1 protein levels, and blocking the induction of myogenin and p21 mRNAs after serum withdrawal (14,16).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The molecular basis for these effects has not been elucidated.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	29	COUP-TF IIis ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues, and regulated by the morphogen, sonic hedgehog (17).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	30	 During embryogenesis, COUP-TF II is expressed in the developing CNS in a spatio-temporal manner (18,19), and in the dermatomial region of the somite at 10 days post coitum, which will give rise to the axial skeletal and tongue muscle (20).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	31	 COUP-TF proteins are highly expressed in many other developing organs and the expression level decreases with completion of differentiation, suggesting that COUP-TF is involved in organogenesis (21,22).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	32	 COUP-TF binds to direct and inverted repeats of the RGGTCA motif spaced by 0-12 nt (23-26).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	33	COUP-TF isoforms I and II have been demonstrated to: (i) repress hormonal trans-activation of target genes by the nuclear receptor family (23-26); (ii) repress trans-activation by the potent GAL4VP16 chimera (16); (iii) interact with TFIIB; and (iv) negatively regulate the transcription of many other genes(e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Apolipoprotein AI gene) (21,27-29).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Inhibition of trans-cription by COUP-TF II has been shown to be mediated by two main mechanisms, active repression and transrepression (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Active repression by COUP-TF involves direct binding and competition for the occupancy of a common response element (31).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Transrepression involves inhibition of transcription by COUP-TF II in the absence of its cognate binding motif, or independent of nucleic acid binding (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, we (16) and Achatz et al.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	39	 (30) have demonstrated that the DNA binding domain (DBD)/C-region of COUP-TF II is necessary for transrepression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The molecular mechanism underlying COUP-TF II transrepression is unclear; however, it has been suggested that direct protein-protein interactions between COUP-TF and essential cofactors may be involved.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Whether COUP-TF II directly regulates the transcription of the bHLH regulators is unclear.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, the fact that COUP-TF II represses transcription in the presence and absence of its cognate binding motif raises the scenario that COUP-TF II may control MyoD activity or the formation of the functional MyoD ternary complex.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	43	Active repression by COUP-TF II is mediated by the nuclear corepressors (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	44	 N-CoR/RIP13 and SMRT/TRAC-2) (16,32-35).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Corepressors actively repress transcription by: (i) interacting with Sin3A/B and recruiting histone deacetylases (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	46	 HDAc-1 or Rpd3) which actively promote chromatin condensation via hypo-acetylation of the chromatin (36-39); and (ii) binding key components of the basal transcriptional machinery (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	47	 TFIIB, TAFII32 and TAFII70) (40).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In the present study, we demonstrate that that repression of MyoD-mediated transactivation by COUP-TF II involves direct binding to MyoD and p300.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	225	 aa 78-213), was sufficient to interact with the RID of p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Interestingly, the VP16-COUP-TF II chimeras 1/2 and 1/3, which contain only part of the DBD (i.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	228	To confirm that COUP-TF II and p300 interact directly, we used the in vitro GST pulldown assay.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Equal quantities of glutathione agarose-immobilised GST (negative control) and GST-COUP-TF II full-length and various sub-domains (GST-COUP-TF II AB, GST-COUP-TF II ABCD, GST-COUP-TF II CD, GST-COUP-TF II CDE and GST-COUP-TF II DE) were incubated with in vitro 35S-radiolabelled full-length p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The resulting pulldown clearly showed a direct interaction between full-length COUP-TF II and in vitro translated p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Furthermore, the CD region of COUP-TF II, spanning aa 78-213, is required for the interaction with p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Interestingly, this is the same region that interacts with MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	233	 It should be noted that the ABCD and CDE regions of COUP-TF II are also sufficient to repress the MyoD-dependent conversion of C3H10T1/2 cells and that the DBD of COUP-TF II (aa 79-144) is essential for the repression of trans-activation in the absence of the cognate binding motif and nucleic acid binding.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	234	COUP-TF II, p300 and MyoD interact in a competitive manner.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	235	We then embarked on experiments designed to analyse whether competitive binding between these interacting proteins was an issue with respect to the formation of a ternary complex.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	236	 We examined the ability of increasing amounts of COUP-TF II CDE to affect the efficiency of interaction between GST-MyoD and radiolabelled p300 (Fig.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	237	 We observed that increasing amounts of radiolabelled COUP-TF II CDE reduced the ability of a fixed amount of 35S-labelled p300 to interact with GST-MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Similarly, we observed that increasing amounts of myoD reduced the ability of p300 to interact with COUP-TF II (Fig.

0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In each pulldown, the input lanes represent ~10% of the total protein.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	243	 (B) Glutathione-immobilised GST-COUP-TF II protein was incubated with 1  microl of 35S-radiolabelled p300 and either 2, 4 or 8  microl of radiolabelled MyoD as indicated.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	244	This suggested that the interaction between COUP-TF II, p300 and myoD is competitive in nature, and that COUP-TF II may be involved in the process that regulates the interaction between MyoD and its cofactor, p300, which is essential for trans-activation of gene expression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	245	The regulation of myogenesis (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	246	 muscle differentiation) is intimately controlled by a group of muscle specific bHLH proteins encoded by the myoD gene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5, MRF-4) (reviewed in 1-3).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The products of the myoD gene family are involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions with many factors that mediate transcription [e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	248	 E12 and E47, TFIIB; 7,44], control the cell cycle (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	249	 RB; 45), and regulate chromatin accessibility and architecture (p300 and PCAF; 11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These protein-protein interactions regulate cellular proliferation and activate myogenic specific transcription that encodes the contractile phenotype.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Insights into the process of myogenesis have been provided by the myoD gene family of transcription factors, because they function at the nexus of command circuits that control the mutually exclusive events of division and differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	252	The nuclear receptor superfamily are potent regulators of development, differentiation, homeostasis and organ physiology; however, their functional role in mammalian muscle differentiation, regulation of MyoD and myogenesis has only been resolved at a descriptive level.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The classical ligand activated nuclear receptors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	254	 thyroid hormone receptor) promote differentiation and muscle maturation in vivo (12,46).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	255	 However, the orphan nuclear receptors including Rev-erb[alpha], RVR and COUP-TF II, which are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and proliferating myogenic cells, antagonistically regulate muscle differentiation and appear to be involved in the maintenance of the proliferative state (13-15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	256	This study was directed toward identifying some of the mechanistic aspects of orphan nuclear receptor-mediated repression of muscle differentiation and myogenic conversion.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Our work suggested that repression of MyoD-mediated trans-activation and myogenic conversion by COUP-TF II involves direct interactions with MyoD and its coactivator, p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Furthermore, the study provides another line of evidence in a biological context which demonstrates that COUP-TF II-mediated repression of MyoD-dependent trans-activation occurs in the absence of the orphan receptor cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This observation strengthens the view that trans-repression by COUP-TF II has a functional role during mammalian muscle differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Finally, it demonstrates that direct crosstalk between the orphan nuclear receptor and bHLH pathways has functional consequences for the regulation of differentiation and phenotypic acquisition.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This mode of action and crosstalk between two central regulatory components may turn out to be utilised in other pathways of mammalian differentiation.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	262	Specifically, our study showed that COUP-TF II could repress MyoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential 10T1/2 cells, when myoD expression was driven by a viral promoter refractory to COUP-TF II action.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	263	 This immunochemical analysis suggested that the CDE region (but not the N-terminal AB region) of COUP-TF II was necessary for the repression of myoD-mediated myogenic conversion.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	264	 In particular, the C and D regions of the orphan receptor, between aa residues 78 and 213, which encode the DBD and hinge region, respectively, were specifically involved in these events.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	265	 We observed that a MyoD-dependent reporter gene driven by four multimerised MyoD binding sites (from the MCK-enhancer), cloned upstream of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, was specifically inhibited by COUP-TF II expression.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Our study suggested that one of the mechanisms involved in this process of repression was the direct interaction between MyoD and COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that the interaction was mediated by the acid-rich N-terminal activation domain of MyoD (which also mediates p300 binding) and the CD region of COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Furthermore, COUP-TF II interacted with the N-terminal RID (aa 1-149) of the cofactor p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This is perhaps not surprising, since many other classical ligand activated nuclear receptors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	270	) interact with the coactivator p300 (42).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	271	 However, the fact that the DBD (C-region) and hinge/D-region of COUP-TF II mediate the interaction to p300 and MyoD is novel, and perhaps suprising.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	272	 With respect to the in vitro and in vivo requirement of the COUP-TF II DBD and hinge region (aa 79-213) as a dimerisation interface for myoD and p300, it should be mentioned that this domain contains the DR and T box motifs, which have been implicated as dimerisation interfaces in RXR (and other nuclear receptors).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Furthermore, they are highly homologous to the similar motifs found in RXR, which is expected, since COUP-TF II and RXR belong to the same nuclear receptor sub-family (47,48).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The DR box has been strongly implicated in the heterodimerisation of TR and RAR with RXR.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The DR boxes in RXR[gamma] and COUP-TF II are highly homologous.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Similarly, the T-box sequence that forms a third helix in RXR, and is implicated in homo- and heterodimerisation, is very similar in COUP-TF II and RXR (49-53).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Recently, COUP-TF II and SpI have been demonstrated to synergistically regulate the transcription of the HIV type I LTR (54).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In support of our observations, they demonstrated that the in vitro and in vivo physical interaction with SpI is mediated by the DBD of COUP-TF.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Furthermore, the Octamer transcription factors are recruited by the C-region (DBD) of the glucocorticoid receptor (55).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	280	COUP-TF II-mediated repression of trans-activation involves the cofactor p300, since co-expression with p300 alleviates the silencing of transcription.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Our study suggested that repression may involve sequestration of this vital cofactor for myoD-mediated trans-activation, since COUP-TF II directly interacts with p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Whether inhibition of MyoD-dependent trans-activation by COUP-TF II binding is a result of: (i) a conformational change in MyoD (which is detrimental to function); (ii) a prevention of p300/cofactor/coactivator binding; (iii) and/or sequestering of cofactors (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	283	 p300) by COUP-TF II is unclear at present.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, the in vitro GST-pulldown data does suggest that MyoD, COUP-TF II and p300 interact in a competitive manner, and that increasing amounts of COUP-TF II have the ability to reduce the interaction between myoD and p300 in vitro.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	285	Achatz and colleagues have demonstrated that repression of transcription by COUP-TF II activity is dependent on the DBD and a segment spanning aa residues 193-399 (30).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Single point mutations in the DBD that ablated sequence-specific binding did not affect the silencing of transcription.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	287	 (16) demonstrated that the repression of GAL4VP16-mediated trans-activation involves the DBD of COUP-TF II in the absence of its cognate binding motif.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Achatz suggested that the regions critical for repression of trans-activation by COUP-TF II were involved in mediating protein-protein interactions.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In the present study, we show that the DBD and hinge region of COUP-TF II alone are sufficient to bind either MyoD or p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Deletions of COUP-TF II that contain only part of the DBD (i.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	291	 from aa 134), however, are not able to interact with the RID of p300, suggesting that the entire DBD is required for binding.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Although the DBD and hinge region functions as a dimerisation interface in COUP-TF II, we also observed that the presence of the E-region strengthens the specificity of the interaction (G.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	293	 While this manuscript was being reviewed, it was demonstrated by Froeschle et al.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	294	 (56) that the DBD of the retinoic acid receptor also directly interacts with MyoD.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Our data and the above data suggested that the DBD of the nuclear receptors may also encode a dimerisation interface for the bHLH family of proteins.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	296	Forced expression of COUP-TF II in C2 myogenic cells blocks differentiation and in particular ablates the induction of p21 mRNA expression (14).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Moreover, in normal proliferating C2 cells, COUP-TF II mRNA is expressed, however, during cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation, the mRNA levels are repressed (15).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Transcription of the p21 gene is specifically stimulated by MyoD during myogenic differentiation, and is coactivated by a transcriptional complex that contains both p300 and PCAF (11).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	299	 In the present study, we show that MyoD-mediated transcription is significantly repressed by COUP-TF II.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	300	 This suggests that COUP-TF II is involved in the maintenance of the proliferative state, by controlling the trans-activation of the p21 gene.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	301	Nuclear receptors have also been shown to interact with a growing family of PAS/bHLH domain coactivators (e.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	302	 SRC1/N-CoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1, ACTR/RAC-3/pCIP) (57-59).
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	303	 However, the N-terminal bHLH/PAS domains in these coactivators function as activation domains, interact with other proteins or are involved in target gene specificity.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	304	 There has been no documented interactions between these regions of the cofactors and the nuclear receptors.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	305	In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that suggests that one of the mechanisms that mediates repression of muscle differentiation and myogenic conversion by COUP-TF II involves direct interactions with MyoD and its coactivator, p300.
0.24778366.9826778.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Whether the direct crosstalk between the orphan nuclear receptor and bHLH pathways has target gene specificity in a developmental context remains to be elucidated, and will be a focus of future studies in the context of mammalian differentiation.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	345	   Discussion TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion REFERENCES   The lacZ knock-in mice allow us to follow the expression of COUP-TFII during gastric development.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	346	 It is apparent that COUP-TFII is expressed in both the mesenchyme and the epithelium of the developing stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	347	 The graded mesenchymal expression profile, with highest levels in mesenchyme subjacent to the epithelium, suggests a diffusible molecule secreted by the epithelium may regulate the expression of COUP-TFII.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	348	 COUP-TFII is also expressed in the glandular epithelium of the stomach, with highest expression in the base where the zymogenic cells are localized, but is not expressed in the surface pit cells.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	349	 The expression patterns in the zymogenic unit resemble that of Shh (van den Brink et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Taken together of the above findings, we speculate that Shh might regulate COUP-TFII in the stomach in a similar manner as previously shown in the motoneurons (Krishnan et al.

0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	353	5, it is already apparent that the circular smooth muscles layers and the enteric neurons layers are expanded and disorganized in the conditional mutants.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	354	 These defects persist at later stages of development.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Although COUP-TFII in the epithelial compartment has not been deleted, the epithelium is considerably thicker in comparison with the control littermates, indicating signals from the mesenchyme are required for appropriate epithelium growth.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The defects display by the COUP-TFII conditional mutants indicate that COUP-TFII is essential for radial patterning of the developing stomach and these defects are not seen in the compound heterozygote of Nkx3.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Instead, the inappropriate differentiation of the smooth muscles cells and enteric neurons in the mesenchyme has been shown when Hh signaling is disrupted by treatment with cyclopamine (Sukegawa et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Shh is believed to be the epithelial signal that inhibits the gut mesenchyme to differentiate into smooth cells and the neural crest cells to differentiate into enteric neurons.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Our findings indicate that COUP-TFII participates in the negative regulation of differentiation of smooth muscle cells and enteric neurons in the gut mesenchyme.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	360	 COUP-TFII can either serve as a downstream target of Hh to mediate its negative function in the gut mesenchyme or exert its effect in a pathway parallel to Hh to regulate mesenchymal differentiation.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	361	In addition to radial patterning of the stomach, COUP-TFII is also required for AP patterning of the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	362	 The anterior shift of the limited ridge that divides the fore- and hind-stomach, the reduced size of the fore-stomach, the expansion of the hind-stomach and the expansion of EAP expression into the hind-stomach are all consistent with disruption of the AP axis patterning in the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	363	 However, the differentiation of the epithelium of the fore- and hind-stomach in the adult mutant remains unchanged; with all the molecular markers analyzed, even the mutant stomach is posteriorized.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	364	 The posteriorization and ectopic extended expression of EAP in the hind-stomach of the conditional mutant have been demonstrated in the Shh-null mutant mice (Ramalho-Santos et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	365	 The striking similarity of the phenotypes exhibited by conditional COUP-TFII-null mutants and animals, chick and mouse, when Hh signaling is disrupted further implicates that Hh and COUP-TFII act in the same and/or parallel pathways.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	366	Although the general slight reduction of expression of COUP-TFII in the Shh-null mutant is a little surprising, the high expression of Ihh in the expanded hind-stomach of the Shh-null mutant could have compensated for the missing Shh to induce COUP-TFII expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Indeed, the downregulation of COUP-TFII expression in the mesenchyme of the stomach is more pronounced in the explants treated with cyclopamine, supporting the notion that COUP-TFII is a downstream target of Hh signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	368	 In addition, Shh signaling can directly activate COUP-TFII expression and Shh-N activates COUP-TFII expression in P19 cells without de novo protein synthesis (Krishnan et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Furthermore, analysis of the COUP-TFII promoter has identified an ShhRE that is distinct from the defined Gli-binding site (Krishnan et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Thus, all the above results indicate that COUP-TFII mediates Hh signaling in the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Taken together, our results established that COUP-TFII is essential for radial and AP patterning of the stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Restriction of anterior Shh expression and attenuation of Shh action in the epithelium of the COUP-TFII conditional mutant, in turn, suggests a potential role for COUP-TFII in the stimulation or maintenance of Shh expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	373	Shh derived from the epithelium signals the mesenchyme of the stomach, but how mesenchymal factors influence endodermally expressed Shh is unclear.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	374	 The Hoxa5-null mutant phenotype provides evidence for mesenchyme-mediated regulation of Shh expression in the developing stomach (Aubin et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Similarly in chick, it was suggested that adjacent mesenchyme regulates Shh expression (Narita et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	376	 In our study, COUP-TFII was ablated in the mesenchyme and the observed dysmorphogenesis suggests that COUP-TFII potentially affects such mesenchymal factor(s).
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	377	 One such candidate, Bmp4, which belongs to the TGFss superfamily, is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing murine stomach, while the chick ortholog has been demonstrated to play a role in gizzard patterning.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Bmp4 is important for mesoderm development, but because of early lethality in Bmp4-null mutants, no specific role for Bmp4 in gastric development has been elucidated (Winnier et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Interestingly, it has been shown that COUP-TFII binds to the mouse Bmp4 promoter and regulates Bmp4 promoter activity in transient transfection assays (Feng et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	380	, 1995), suggesting COUP-TFII might function through BMP signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Another member of TGFss super family, activin, governs embryonic axial patterning, and restricts Shh expression in Hensen's node (Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin, 2001).
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	382	 Furthermore, the expansion of Shh expression domain within the stomach of Acvr2a/Acvr2b mutant mice indicates a restriction of Shh in the foregut that is potentially regulated by TGFss/Bmp signaling.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	383	 As Acvr2 is able to interact with BMPs (Kim et al.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	384	, 2000), mesenchymal expressed Bmp4 may restrict Shh expression.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Alternatively, it is possible that COUP-TFII may modulate the expression of activin/activin receptor themselves.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Enhanced activin signaling may restrict the expression domain of Shh to the anterior border and perturb the epithelial growth, as seen in the conditional mutant stomach.
0.25421372.15829524.html.plaintext.txt	387	 Further analysis of TGFss/Bmp/activin signaling in the COUP-TFII conditional mutant stomach may shed light on which mesenchymal factor(s) that regulate Shh expression are affected by the absence of COUP-TFII.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although COUP-TFI can both actively silence gene transcription and antagonize the functions of various other nuclear receptors, the COUP-TFI orphan receptor also acts as a transcriptional activator in certain contexts.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, COUP-TFI has recently been shown to serve as an accessory factor for some ligand-bound nuclear receptors, suggesting that it may modulate, both negatively and positively, a wide range of hormonal responses.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	10	 In the absence of any identified cognate ligand, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity remain unclear.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The elucidation of several putative phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, PKC, and casein kinase II within the sequence of this orphan receptor led us to investigate phosphorylation events regulating the various COUP-TFI functions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	12	 After showing that COUP-TFI is phosphorylated in vivo, we provide evidence that in vivo inhibition of either MAPK or PKC signaling pathway leads to a specific and pronounced decrease in COUP-TFI-dependent transcriptional activation of the vitronectin gene promoter.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying the MAPK- and PKC-mediated regulation of COUP-TFI activity, we show that COUP-TFI can be directly targeted by PKC and MAPK.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These phosphorylation events differentially modulate COUP-TFI functions: PKC-mediated phosphorylation enhances COUP-TFI affinity for DNA and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation positively regulates the transactivation function of COUP-TFI, possibly through enhancing specific coactivator recruitment.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These data provide evidence that COUP-TFI is likely to integrate distinct signaling pathways and raise the possibility that multiple extracellular signals influence biological processes controlled by COUP-TFI.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	16	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   THE NUCLEAR RECEPTOR superfamily encompasses many ligand-activated transcription factors in addition to also a large number of proteins whose ligands are unknown and which are thus termed orphan receptors (1, 2).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These receptors play crucial roles both as transcriptional activators and repressors, and are regulators of a wide range of biological functions including development, metabolism and reproduction.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Among nuclear orphan receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are encoded by distinct genes sharing an exceptionally high degree of sequence homology (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The expression patterns of COUP-TFs have been extensively studied in several divergent species and appear to be relatively similar, suggesting a conservation of COUP-TF function throughout evolution.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although each COUP-TF has its own distinct expression pattern during embryonic development and in adult mice, these patterns are often overlapping and both genes are widely expressed in the developing central nervous system (8, 11, 12, 13).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings suggest a functional redundancy among COUP-TFs, which are classically considered to act as key factors during neurogenesis.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Overexpression of COUP-TFs and gene disruption experiments performed in Drosophila, Xenopus, and mouse, define a major role of these orphan receptors in the formation of the anterior brain in tetrapods, in the patterning of the eye in the fly, and in the modulation of axogenesis and cranial neural crest cell behavior in mammals, respectively (3, 9, 14, 15, 16).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The recent finding that COUP-TFI function is required for cortical layer IV cell survival through correct guidance and connection of axons from mouse thalamic neurons supports the hypothesis that COUP-TFI functions in the transcriptional control of axon guidance cues (17).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Aside from neuronal expression patterns, COUP-TFs show overlapping, yet distinct, expression patterns in many tissues during development, suggesting their involvement in organogenesis (8, 13).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Consistent with a role for these nuclear receptors accessory to neurogenesis, recent data show that COUP-TFII is involved in angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and heart development (16, 18).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	26	Initial studies identified COUP-TFs as transcriptional activators (19, 20, 21, 22); nevertheless, COUP-TFs can repress the transcriptional activation mediated by a number of ligand-bound nuclear receptors, including VDR, TRs, RXRs, and RARs (23, 24, 25, 26).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A functional cross-talk between COUP-TFs and retinoid-signaling pathways during development has been proposed, based on the comprehensively documented antagonistic effects of COUP-TFs on retinoid-dependent gene expression, and the observation that COUP-TF genes are themselves targeted by retinoids (7, 8, 15, 27, 28).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, recent data indicate that the orphan receptors can also serve as accessory factors for some ligand-bound nuclear receptors such as GR, ER, and RAR (29, 30, 31).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In some specific promoter contexts, COUP-TFs are thus able to enhance the ligand-induced transactivation function of these various receptors, suggesting that COUP-TFs may be required for effectively establishing the cues for certain genetic responses after exposure of the cell to a ligand.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In this respect, it is not surprising that common phenotypes, such as similar bone fusions, are generated in COUP-TFI-/- and RAR1-/-/RARss-/- independent knockout experiments (16, 32).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The recent finding that COUP-TFI is required for the induction of growth inhibition and apoptosis by retinoic acid in cancer cells further substantiates a positive interaction between COUP-TFs and retinoid receptors in vivo (31).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	32	With very few exceptions, most ligand-dependent nuclear receptors can be activated in a ligand-independent manner through phosphorylation events (33).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	33	 As an example, ER can activate transcription after phosphorylation, independent of supplemented E2 (33, 34, 35, 36, 37).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In a similar manner, many other ligand-regulated nuclear receptors are either activated or repressed through phosphorylation events (33, 34), and these regulatory mechanisms seem relevant also to the orphan receptors such as Nur77/NGFI-B, HNF-4 or ROR (38, 39, 40, 41).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Although COUP-TFs were cloned more than 10 yr ago, a ligand has yet to be elucidated or characterized, suggesting that COUP-TFs could be true orphan nuclear receptors.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, PKC, and casein kinase II (CKII), within its sequence led us to postulate that COUP-TFI could be targeted by cellular kinases.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this report, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI can be directly phosphorylated by PKC and MAPK, these phosphorylation events differently modulating COUP-TFI functions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	38	 COUP-TFI is thus likely to be regulated by extracellular signals transduced through distinct phosphorylation pathways.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	39	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Two Nuclear Receptor Half-Binding Sites within the Vitronectin (Vn) Gene Promoter Mediate Transcriptional Activation by the Orphan Nuclear Receptor COUP-TFI Previously, we have shown that COUP-TFI can transactivate the mouse Vn gene promoter in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (42).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Figure 1 demonstrates that the ability of COUP-TFI to activate this promoter is not restricted to P19 cells considering the observation of the similar induction in COS-7 cells (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	41	 To delineate the promoter sequences involved in this phenomenon as well as the mode of activation by COUP-TFI, we mutated individually or in combination the two consensus (TGACCC) half-binding sites for nuclear receptors present in the mouse promoter referred to as NR1 and NR2 (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Whereas the NR2 half-site could generate a direct repeat with a 3-bp spacer (DR-3) when combined to the degenerated TGACTT sequence located downstream of the NR2 site, no TGACCC-related sequence could be found in the vicinity of the NR1 sequence (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Thereby, both consensus half-sites could organize a DR-66 element stably interacting with COUP-TFI dimers.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	44	 When cotransfected in COS-7 cells with a COUP-TFI expression vector, the promoter in which the NR1 site was mutated was activated at a much lower level compared with its wt counterpart (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Mutation of the NR2 site moderately reduced COUP-TFI-induced activation (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The double NR1/NR2 mutant did not show a greater reduction of COUP-TFI-induced activity compared with the single NR1 mutant (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These data strongly suggest that the NR1 site prevails over the NR2 site for COUP-TFI activation of the Vn promoter in COS-7 cells.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Because COS cells are known to overproduce proteins encoded by transfected vectors, the relatively high amounts of COUP-TFI expressed in COS-7 cells could have attenuated the impact of the mutations introduced in the Vn gene promoter.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Based on this observation, we transfected P19 cells with the different mutants to verify their ability to be activated by COUP-TFI (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In this cellular context, both NR1 and NR2 mutations reduced COUP-TFI activation by 50%.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	51	 When combined, the NR1 and NR2 mutations resulted in a loss of COUP-TFI activation by 78% (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	52	 1C), suggesting that binding to both sites is required for COUP-TFI transactivation in P19 cells.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Consistent with the transfection data indicating that the NR1 site is involved in the Vn gene promoter regulation, we observed that COUP-TFI could effectively interact as a dimer (as suggested by the position of the protein/DNA complex) with the NR1 half-site in EMSA experiments (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Although COUP-TFI was able to interact with the NR1-containing oligonucleotide, it conferred low affinity for this element judged by the observation that cold NR1 is a poor competitor compared with the high affinity DR1 binding element (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	55	 These experiments clearly indicate that COUP-TFI could transactivate the mouse Vn gene promoter through direct binding to at least one low affinity site including the NR1 sequence, and possibly to a second site composed of the NR2 element.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, the residual activation by COUP-TFI observed with the double mutant suggests that other undetected binding-sites could be recognized by the orphan receptor, or that part of the COUP-TFI activity could be unrelated to DNA binding as previously shown in other contexts (43).

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	77	 2A, in silico analysis of the human COUP-TFI protein sequence revealed several putative phosphorylation sites targeted by distinct cellular kinases, namely CKII, PKC, and proline-directed kinases such as MAPKs.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The consensus phosphorylation sites were defined as S/TXXD/E for CKII (44), S/TXR/K for PKC (45), and PX1-2S/TP for the three distinct MAPK pathways identified in mammalian cells (46).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These pathways include members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/p44MAPK and ERK2/p42MAPK, the Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p38 kinase (47, 48, 49).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The three putative MAPK phosphorylation sites identified within the human COUP-TFI sequence were found to be highly conserved throughout evolution (8), and were clustered in the amino-terminal A/B domain (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The putative CKII and PKC phosphorylation sites, some of which were also evolutionarily conserved (8), were in contrast distributed throughout the COUP-TFI sequence (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The DNA binding domain (DBD) contained exclusively PKC target sites, whereas the A/B and the putative ligand binding domain (LBD) of the receptor displayed both CKII and PKC potential target sequences (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The presence of several putative phosphorylation sites for various cellular kinases in the human COUP-TFI sequence raises the possibility that, similar to posttranslational modifications described for several nuclear receptors, COUP-TFI could be a phosphoprotein in vivo, whose activity may be regulated by specific phosphorylation events.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To test this hypothesis, we cloned the human COUP-TFI cDNA encoding residues 57 to 423 in frame with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) coding sequence of the mammalian expression vector pBC/GST.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Consistent with our previous results, cotransfection with increasing amounts of COUP-TFI expression plasmid led to a dose-dependent induction of reporter gene activity.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Whereas basal activity was not altered, treatment of the cells with PD980059 led to a significant decrease (76% inhibition of the activation) in reporter gene activity observed in the presence of 50 ng of COUP-TFI expression vector (Fig.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	111	 As assessed by Western blotting, this inhibition was not due to a decrease in nuclear receptor expression (data not shown, see Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Concurrent with the previous observation, the inhibition of COUP-TFI- induced reporter gene activity was not due to a reduced expression of COUP-TFI in COS-7 cells treated with GF 109203X (data not shown, see Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The COUP-TFI 57 to 423 protein is truncated at the amino-terminal region of the A/B domain, lacking a putative CKII and PKC phosphorylation sequence (S7), as well as two amino-terminal (T51 and T54) MAPK phosphorylation sites.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In addition to these four sites, the COUP-TFI 84 to 423 protein, which is deleted of almost the entire A/B domain (86 first amino acids), is devoid of the third putative MAPK phosphorylation site (T63) and of a CKII phosphorylation site (T66).

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Moreover, both PD980059 and GF 109203X efficiently counteracted the reporter gene activation mediated by 50 ng of COUP-TFI 57 to 423 expression vector.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This observation suggests that the region spanning residues 1 to 56 of COUP-TFI, including one PKC and two MAPK potential phosphorylation sites, is dispensable for transactivation and is not involved in the regulation of COUP-TFI activity by the PKC and MAPK pathways.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with increasing amounts of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 expression vector resulted in a weak stimulation of the reporter gene (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	144	 These data suggest that residues 57 to 83 play a crucial role, directly or indirectly, in the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation, and raise the possibility that the third (T63) MAPK phosphorylation site could be a hierarchal requisite for COUP-TFI activity and for the MAPK-mediated regulation of the nuclear receptor functions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	145	 This was, to some extent, confirmed by the observation that PD980059 is significantly less efficient in inhibiting the COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transcriptional activation than it is in decreasing COUP-TFI 57 to 423-induced activation (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The residual effect of PD980059 on COUP-TFI 84 to 423-mediated transactivation suggests the involvement of an additional nonconsensus MAPK phosphorylation site located between residues 84 to 423, or that MAPK indirectly modulates COUP-TFI activity.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Finally, in cells cotransfected with 50 ng of COUP-TFI 84 to 423 expression vector, treatment with GF 109203X reduced the reporter gene activity to the basal level (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In vitro treatment of the WCEs prepared from COUP-TFI-expressing cells with CIP buffer alone or CIP buffer and phosphate had no effect on the intensity of the shifted band, showing that neither of the compounds affected the binding of COUP-TFI to DNA elements.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In contrast, treatment of WCEs with CIP strongly decreased the intensity of the shifted band, providing evidence for a CIP-mediated decrease in the formation of the COUP-TFI/DR1 complex.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The hypothesis that CIP-mediated dephosphorylation of COUP-TFI inhibited nuclear receptor binding to specific DNA elements was further substantiated by the observation that addition of phosphate to the dephosphorylation mixture abolished the effect of the CIP.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	239	 These data clearly demonstrate that COUP-TFI can be directly targeted by PKC in vitro, and that PKC-mediated phosphorylation enhances the affinity of the nuclear receptor for DNA by approximately 3-fold.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	264	 To investigate this hypothesis further, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays to determine which functional domain(s) of COUP-TFI could be targeted by the purified MAPK (ERK2/p42MAPK) in vitro.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Our next objective was to determine whether MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could directly regulate the transactivation function of COUP-TFI.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Based on the results obtained using COS-7 cells (Fig.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	283	 This putative MAPK phosphorylation site was therefore inactivated through replacement of the conserved threonine residue to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue.

0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Most, if not all, nuclear receptors studied to date are phosphoproteins whose functions are regulated by phosphorylation.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Indeed, apart from their participation in conventional hormone-dependent activation process, phosphorylation-mediated ligand-independent regulation of nuclear receptors activity has been well documented (33, 34).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Despite these findings, such a mechanism may not be ubiquitous; indeed, the GR appears to be refractory to activation in the absence of its cognate ligand.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	306	 This mode of action seems to be relevant for most other steroid/thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors as well as for various orphan receptors (33, 38, 39, 40, 41).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The identification of several putative phosphorylation sites for CKII, PKC, and MAPK, led us to study the potential involvement of these signaling pathways in the regulation of COUP-TFI function.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Our data first show that COUP-TFI is a phosphoprotein in vivo.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Despite the observation that human COUP-TFI sequence contains eight putative target sites for CKII, our data strongly suggest that this kinase is unlikely to regulate the nuclear receptor activity, in the cellular and promoter contexts considered.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	310	 In contrast, we provide evidence for the involvement of both PKC and MAPK (p42MAPK/p44MAPK) transduction pathways in the modulation of COUP-TFI functions in vivo.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	311	Focusing on the PKC pathway, we demonstrated that selective inhibition of this pathway in vivo actively decreases COUP-TFI-dependent activation of the Vn gene promoter.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	312	 In this study, we provide data that clearly show that PKC directly targets COUP-TFI in vitro and enhances its binding to various response elements.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Precedents for both positive and negative regulations of DNA binding by phosphorylation exist for numerous nuclear receptors, including ER, GR, RAR, TR2, TRss1, Nur77/NGFI-B, and HNF-4.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	314	 These regulatory mechanisms are not yet fully understood and highly complex, as they involve a wide range of protein kinases with target sites located within, nearby, or far from the DBD.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	315	 While phosphorylation-mediated by PKA enhances GR binding to DNA (51), this kinase has been shown to inhibit binding of HNF-4 in vitro and in vivo (40).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Consistent with the involvement of the A-box in the high affinity DNA binding of HNF-4 (52), phosphorylation at a consensus PKA-dependent site located within this region results in a modification of the receptor binding to DNA (40).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Similarly, phosphorylation of NGFI-B within its A-box also decreases DNA binding (38, 39).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	318	 In both cases, the reduction of DNA binding of the receptor is likely to reflect a local effect: phosphorylations occurring nearby to the DBD could either induce a local conformational change impairing DNA recognition, inhibit protein/DNA contacts by steric hindrance, or electrostatically hinder interactions between the phosphate groups of the protein and the similarly charged phosphate backbone of the DNA.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In contrast, phosphorylation of TR2, a variant of the thyroid hormone receptor, within a unique carboxy-terminal region mediated by CKII decreases its binding to DNA via a mechanism that is likely to involve a phosphorylation-induced change in the overall conformation of the protein (53).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	320	 A similar mechanism, which is likely to underlie the positive regulation exerted by CKII on the binding of ER to its response element, involves phosphorylation events occurring at an amino acid residue located within the amino-terminal A/B domain of the receptor, resulting in intramolecular interactions affecting the DNA binding domain and its function (54, 55).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	321	 In addition to these direct mechanisms, indirect phosphorylation-mediated regulations of DNA binding have also been reported; these are often due to a modulation of the dimerization interface of the nuclear receptors by phosphorylation events.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	322	 For example, phosphorylation of TRss1 enhances TRss1/RXR heterodimerization, leading to an increase in DNA binding (56, 57).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Such an indirect regulation of DNA binding is also relevant for RAR/RXR heterodimers where PKC-mediated phosphorylation event at a serine residue located in the T-box of RAR prevents heterodimerization (58, 59).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Based on the finding that the T-box of RAR engages dimerization contacts with the DBD of RXR (60), phosphorylation occurring within this region may introduce strong conformational constraints on the dimerization interface, thus impairing heterodimerization and subsequent DNA binding (58, 59).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	325	 While PKC has been shown to down-regulate DNA binding for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, both through direct and indirect mechanisms, there is, to our knowledge, no evidence for PKC-mediated positive effects on the DNA binding of any member of this superfamily.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	326	 In this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of COUP-TFI by PKC increases the affinity of the orphan receptor for specific DNA elements.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Moreover, we show that the enhancement of DNA binding does not result from a modification of the ability of COUP-TFI to homodimerize, but rather appears to be a direct mechanism.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Consistent with this idea, the DBD of COUP-TFI is targeted by PKC in vitro, whereas the LBD, which contains the major homodimerization surface (61), is not.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to ascertain that T121 is a target for PKC, whereas no other modifications were detected.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Although the region spanning amino acids 1 to 57 also contains at least one target site for PKC, our data demonstrate that the amino-terminal A/B domain of the nuclear receptor is dispensable for DNA binding and its phosphorylation-dependent regulation.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	331	 We propose that COUP-TFI binding to DNA is positively and directly regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation targeting T121 within the DNA binding domain of the receptor.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	332	COUP-TFI may integrate multiple signaling pathways considering our finding that the MAPK pathway specifically regulates COUP-TFI transactivation function.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	333	 While having no effect on nuclear translocation or DNA binding function, inhibition of the p42MAPK/p44MAPK pathway in vivo strongly inhibits the COUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional activation of the Vn gene promoter.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Moreover, we showed that ERK2/p42MAPK directly targets COUP-TFI at distinct phosphorylation sites in vitro.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	335	 While the LBD is not phosphorylated by MAPK, at least one target site is present in the amino-terminal region of the A/B domain (i.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	336	 amino acids 1 to 57) of COUP-TFI.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	337	 The functional relevance of this phosphorylation event in vivo remains unclear because the deletion of the amino-terminal region to residue 57 does not affect the subcellular distribution, DNA binding activity and transactivation function of the receptor, or the MAPK-mediated regulation of the COUP-TFI-dependent transcription.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Other phosphorylation sites, located between residues 57 and 153, are directly targeted by ERK2/p42MAPK in vitro, and the ERK2-mediated phosphorylation event that might specifically target T63 in vivo is shown here to play an active role in cell-specific transcriptional activation by COUP-TFI.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Such a modulation by MAPK-mediated phosphorylation could result from modifications in coactivator recruitment as previously reported for various nuclear receptors.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	340	 Indeed, ERss can be activated by the Ras-dependent MAPK pathway in the absence of its cognate ligand via direct phosphorylation within the A/B domain (62, 63).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of MAPK target sites located in the AF-1 region stimulates ligand- and AF-2-independent interaction between ERss and SRC-1, thus allowing for ligand-independent activation of ERss (63).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	342	 In addition to ERss, several authors have reported observations of functional cross-talk between growth factors and ER signaling pathways, both in the absence and presence of ligand (64, 65, 66, 67, 68).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Consistent with the requirement of the AF-1 region for the activation of the apo-form ER in response to growth factors, one serine residue S118 located in the A/B domain of ER is directly targeted by the MAPK in response to EGF, and these phosphorylation events increase the AF-1 activity (66, 67, 68).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	344	 The mechanism underlying this enhancement has recently been elucidated and involves the MAPK-dependent recruitment of the coactivator p68 by the AF-1 region of ER (69).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	345	 In addition to these local effects, the MAPK pathway can, by intramolecular communication between different nuclear receptor domains, positively or negatively regulate coactivator binding by domains that are distinct from the ones targeted by specific phosphorylation events (70, 71).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	346	 For example, phosphorylation of a serine residue located within the hinge region of SF-1 is required for maximal interaction of its LBD with the coactivator GRIP-1, results in the ligand-independent activation of SF-1 (71).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	347	 Similarly, MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of a single amino acid residue in the A/B domain of PPAR alters the overall conformation of the apo-form receptor in a way that impairs ligand binding, thereby indirectly preventing the recruitment of coactivators such as SRC-1 (70).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Thus, interdomain communication allows phosphorylation events targeting the amino-terminal A/B domain of PPAR to regulate independent properties of the LBD.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	349	 This regulatory mechanism is involved in the MAPK-mediated inhibition of PPAR ligand-dependent transactivation function in response to various growth factors and cytokines, and has important repercussions on PPAR activity in vivo (70, 72, 73).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Taken together, these results show that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation events play crucial roles in the modulation of nuclear receptor/coactivator interactions, a regulatory mechanism that, according to recent data, may also be relevant to nuclear receptor/corepressor interactions (74, 75).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Further experiments will tell if ERK2 can modify COUP-TFI/coactivator interactions.
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	352	Integration of multiple signaling pathways by the human COUP-TFI nuclear receptor would undoubtedly have repercussions on a wide range of biological processes that involve COUP-TFI, such as cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis as well as embryonic development (8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 31, 76).
0.25574476.12040019.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Results described in this study indicate that there is a possibility that a variety of extracellular stimuli, transduced by MAPK and PKC signaling pathways, participate in the multifactorial regulation of the diverse biological processes that are controlled by COUP-TFI.

0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	234	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   PPAR interactions with COUP-TF proteins The COUP-TF proteins increased expression from the LPL promoter synergistically with PPAR2/RXR in 293T cells, and this was dependent on the presence of an intact PPRE.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This contrasts with many studies that have reported antagonistic actions between COUP-TF and PPAR when compared on a common promoter DNA recognition element.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In the majority of cases, transcription was increased by PPAR proteins and decreased by COUP-TF proteins; examples include the promoters for apolipoprotein AI (36), medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (37, 38), hydratase dehydrogenase (39, 40), malic enzyme (41, 42), and mitochondrial hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (43).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In contrast, the transferrin promoter is the sole example where expression was decreased by PPAR proteins but increased by COUP-TF proteins (13).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Nevertheless, it is likely that the promoters of other hepatic proteins repressed by peroxisome proliferator compounds will exhibit this same profile; candidates include the transthyretin and 2u-macroglobulin gene promoters (44).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	239	However, the actions of PPAR and COUP-TF proteins are not necessarily antagonistic.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	240	 There are examples where both PPAR and COUP-TF actions increase transcription from a common DNA recognition element; these include the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (10) and the phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase promoter (11, 12, 45).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The murine LPL promoter exhibits this same pattern of regulation in the 293T cell line.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	242	This conflicting pattern of both positive and negative interactions with COUP-TF is not unique to PPAR proteins and PPREs.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Similar findings with COUP-TF have been reported for the estrogen receptor and estrogen receptor recognition elements (EREs).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In a study examining a consensus ERE, COUP-TF proteins were observed to bind to the DNA element and to repress estrogen ligand activation of a reporter gene (46).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In contrast, in studies of the intact estrogen receptor gene promoter containing an ERE, COUP-TF bound to the ERE and increased transcription in synergy with the estrogen receptor (47).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Independent of the mechanism accounting for these disparate interactions between COUP-TF and nuclear hormone receptors, the current findings support the conclusion that COUP-TF proteins can positively modulate LPL promoter transcription through the PPAR recognition element in 293T cells.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	247	PPAR2 interactions with SMRT The presence of SMRT repressed PPAR2/RXR-mediated transcription from the LPL promoter 9-fold.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	248	 This contrasts with the reported less than 2-fold repression by SMRT of transcription from the isolated acyl-coenyzme A oxidase PPRE (18).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	249	 As both studies employed 293T cells, this discrepancy cannot be attributed to differences in the cell model (18).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Instead, the DNA site itself is a more likely explanation (18).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The compositions of the DNA recognition element and its 5'-flanking sequences are known to influence PPAR protein binding affinity and specificity (9, 48, 49, 50).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	252	 As has been postulated previously (18), alterations in the DNA sequence could result in conformational changes in the DNA recognition element/PPAR protein complex.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This could lead to subsequent allosteric changes in the accessibility of the bound PPAR protein s corepressor-interactive domain to the SMRT protein.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Thus, the SMRT protein may regulate PPREs differentially depending on their DNA compositions and flanking sequences.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The relative stoichiometry of the SMRT protein relative to the nuclear hormone receptor proteins PPAR, RXR and COUP-TF may further contribute to the tissue-specific regulation of LPL.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Data supporting a role for SMRT as a PPAR corepressor comes from recent microinjection experiments using anti-SMRT and anti-N-CoR antibodies (51).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In cells transfected with a PPRE-directed reporter gene, injection of an anti-SMRT antibody (but not an anti-N-CoR antibody) relieved PPAR-mediated repression induced by stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (51).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	258	The current results mapping the PPAR2-interactive domain of SMRT to between amino acids 1289 to 1495 confirm and extend earlier studies (18).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	259	 This region corresponds to one of the two distinct receptor-interactive domains (RID) delineated in the SMRT carboxyl-terminal (RID2, amino acids 1260 to 1495) (52).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The PPAR2-interactive domain of SMRT is similar to that used by the thyroid receptor (52), but differs from those used by the retinoic acid receptor (RID1, corresponding to amino acids 1086 to 1291) (52) and by COUP-TF1 (the amino-terminal portion of SMRT) (25).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	261	In summary, this work demonstrates that COUP-TFII (ARP-1) and SMRT can modulate transcription from the LPL promoter in the presence of PPAR2 and RXR in an in vitro system.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	262	 These observations are consistent with current models suggesting that the relative stochiometry of nuclear receptors and their corepressors regulates promoter function and accounts for cell-specific gene expression (18).
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Both COUP-TF and SMRT proteins may play an in vivo role in the complex physiological regulation of LPL.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	264	 However, the current studies were limited to a single cell line.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The 293T cells constitutively express the simian virus 40 T antigen (27), and the possibility exists that this has contributed to the current findings.
0.21701698.10098492.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Future studies will extend and test these observations in primary adipose tissues and other sites of LPL expression.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These receptors include hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, thyroid hormone receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR), ERss, and retinoid X receptor (RXR).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In yeast cells, a LexA fusion protein to the human ER ligand-binding domain (LexA/ER-LBD) was an inert transactivator of a LacZ reporter gene controlled by upstream LexA-binding sites.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, LexA/ER-LBD differentially modulated the LacZ reporter gene expression when coexpressed with native TRs, RARs, or RXRs.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	9	 From these results, we propose that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these interactions should mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcriptional regulatory proteins linked by conserved structure and function (1).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (2).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements (HREs) in promoters of target genes.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to HREs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	14	 A dimerization interface has previously been identified within the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of retinoid X receptors (RXRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) that selectively promotes DNA binding to cognate HREs (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	15	 An additional dimerization interface that mediates cooperative binding to DNA, referred to as the I-box, has recently been mapped to a 40-amino acid region within the C-terminal ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of RAR, TR, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter (COUP-TF), RXR, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (9, 10).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The two dimerization domains appear to work in tandem and led to a two-step hypothesis for binding of dimers to DNA (2, 9).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	17	 According to this hypothesis, the LBD dimerization interface initiates the formation of solution dimers that, in turn, acquire the capacity to bind to a number of differently organized HREs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, formation of a second dimer interface within the DBD restricts receptors to bind to only cognate HREs (2, 9).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	19	While some nuclear receptors apparently bind HREs only as homodimers, TRs, vitamin D receptor, RARs, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and several orphan nuclear receptors bind their specific response elements with high affinity as heterodimers with RXRs (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Based on this high-affinity binding, such heterodimers have been considered to be the functionally active forms of these receptors in vivo.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, RXR is not the only receptor capable of forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	22	 TR (17, 18), COUP-TF (19, 20, 21), PPAR (22), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) (23) have been reported to form heterodimers with other receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Interestingly, although heterodimerization with RXR usually results in enhanced transactivation, COUP-TF and SHP seem to function primarily as transcriptional repressors (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Heterodimer formation can generate many different combinations of receptors, particularly in the light of the fact that multiple genes and multiple isoforms exist for RAR, RXR, TR, COUP-TF, and PPAR.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	25	 As the expression of each isoform depends on cell type and the stage of growth and development, heterodimerization among all these receptors results in the formation of an extremely diverse group of receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In principle, the enormous number of heterodimer combinations could cover a wide range of transcriptional activities, thus generating significant diversity in gene regulation.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	27	Herein, we show that estrogen receptor (ER) directly binds, through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, to HNF4, TR, RAR, and RXR, adding a complexity to the already complicated list of the heteromeric interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We have also confirmed the results (29, 30) that newly cloned ER named ERss interacts with ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In parallel, COUP-TF (31), estrogen-related receptor 1 (ERR1) (32), and SHP (D.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Moore, personal communications) were shown to interact with ER, while this manuscript was in preparation.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We further show that coexpression of native TR, RAR, or RXR differentially regulates transactivations by ER in yeast and CV1 cells.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These results suggest that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these interactions mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	33	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   ER Interacts with a Subset of Nuclear Receptors in Yeast We found that coexpression of a previously described B42/RXR-LBD hybrid (33) stimulates the LexA/ER-LBD (a LexA fusion protein with the LBD of ER)-mediated LacZ reporter gene expression in the yeast two-hybrid tests, suggesting that ER-LBD interacts with RXR-LBD (Fig.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We further found that the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression was stimulated when coexpressed with analogous B42 fusions to several receptors, including RAR, TR, HNF4, and ERss, suggesting that ER also interacts with these receptors (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The expression was slightly enhanced by 1  microM T3 with the B42/TR coexpression, whereas it was significantly stimulated by 1  microM E2 with the B42/ERss coexpression (3-fold) (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In addition, we showed that an inert transactivator LexA/ERss stimulated the LacZ reporter gene expression approximately 6.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	39	5-fold when coexpressed with B42/ERss, confirming the recently reported ERss homodimerization (29, 30) in this yeast system (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In contrast, coexpression of B42 alone or B42 fusions to the LBDs of TRss, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), or the orphan receptor CAR (34) did not stimulate the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression, attesting to the specificity of these interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Similarly, expressions of all the B42 fusions alone, with no LexA fusion coexpressed, were transcriptionally inert with the LacZ reporter (data not shown).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, the B42/TR-LBD coexpression stimulated the LexA/ER-LBD-mediated LacZ expression approximately 2.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	43	5-fold in the presence of 1  microM T3, raising the possibility that TR-LBD may contain a T3-inducible interaction domain with ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	44	 From these results, we concluded that ER-LBD may interact with RAR, RXR-LBD, TR, TRss-LBD (only in the presence of T3), HNF4-LBD, and ERssL, in which LBDs are likely to be sufficient.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	45	 It is noteworthy that the LacZ expression strength by coexpression of these ER heterocomplexes was generally comparable to that of the previously described TR/RXR heterodimer (33) (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	46	 1B, compare with the results of LexA/TR-LBD and B42/RXR-LBD).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Overall, the similarities in the pattern of interactions observed with LexA/ER-LBD and LexA/RXR-LBD (33, 35, 36) strongly suggest that ER, like the RXRs, is a common interaction partner for members of the receptor superfamily.

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	63	 1B, the 9-cis-RA-dependent induction of the LacZ expression observed with coexpression of B42/RXR-LBD and LexA/TR-LBD was lost when B42/RXR-LBDAF2 was coexpressed instead, whereas the T3-dependent induction was specifically lost when LexA/TR-LBD459 was used.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	64	 When LexA/TR-LBD459 and B42/RXR-LBDAF2 were coexpressed, neither T3 nor 9-cis-RA-depedent induction of the LacZ expression was observed.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	65	 These results, along with our previous finding (33) in which the interactions of LexA/TR and B42/RXR were not affected by mutations into the AF2 domain of TR, clearly demonstrate that protein-protein interaction of TR and RXR are ligand independent.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Therefore, results of the yeast two-hybrid tests should be taken with caution that they may not represent true ligand-dependent interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Thus, we further characterized these interactions using two additional methods (i.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	68	 mammalian two-hybrid tests and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull downs).

0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	138	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   It has been demonstrated that control of E2-responsive gene regulation can be quite complex (reviewed in Ref.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Several lines of evidence indicated that gene regulation by E2 and ERE involves not only ER but also other transcription factors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	140	 For example, other nuclear receptors such as TR, RXR, COUP-TF, ERR1, and RAR have been shown to interact with EREs in addition to their cognate response elements (40, 41, 42).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	141	 In this report, we have clearly shown that ER, along with RXR, is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, suggesting that E2-responsive gene regulation may also involve direct protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	142	 In particular, it is an interesting possibility that these different ER heterocomplexes may mediate novel signaling pathways through their own DNA-binding sites that are distinct from the conventional EREs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In contrast to the broad positive effects of RXR, these ER heterointeractions led to differential regulation of the transactivations by ER (Figs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	144	 In addition, cotransfection results dramatically varied depending on cell types (CV1 vs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	145	 MCF7 cells, for instance) and receptor isotypes (M.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These differential regulations may result from direct bindings of ER heterodimers to ERE, which either positively or negatively regulates E2-induced gene expression.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Alternatively, formation of a non ERE-binding heterodimer may simply inhibit E2-induced gene expression or allow other positive- or negative-acting proteins to occupy EREs instead.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Despite our extensive efforts, however, we were not able to find any intermediate heterodimer bindings or inhibitions of ER bindings to ERE by these ER-interacting receptors in electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) (data not shown).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Similarly, heterodimers of COUP-TF/ER (31), ERR1/ER (32), and SHP/ER (D.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Moore, personal communications) readily detected in solution were not observed to bind EREs in EMSA.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In parallel, two recent reports showed interaction of COUP-TF with orphan receptors nurr77 (20) and HNF4 (21) only in solution but not when bound to DNA.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	152	 These results are consistent with the possibility that these ER/receptors may bind EREs as a heterodimer or a higher-order complex not stable enough to sustain in EMSA.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These weak complexes may show distinct phenotypes by differentially interacting with other proteins such as recently defined transcription cofactors, which are often receptor- and cell type-specific (reviewed in Ref.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Consistent with this possibility, xSRC-3, an SRC-1 homolog we recently isolated from Xenopus, was found to show unexpected specificity in tissue distribution and receptor interactions (44).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	155	Even though the oligomeric status of the ER heterocomplexes are not currently known, two lines of evidence attest to the specificity of the protein-protein interactions between ER and these receptors.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	156	 First, a series of chimeric HNF4s we recently constructed to define the HNF4 homodimeric interactions and RXR heterodimeric interactions (10) differentially interacted with ER (our unpublished results).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Second, we isolated a few mutant RXRs that show specifically impaired interactions with ER while maintaining wild-type interactions with other receptors (our unpublished results).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Similar to the chimeric HNF4s, these mutations also reside within the I-box of the RXR, which was recently found to be essential for homo- and heterodimer formations (9, 10), suggesting that HNF4 and RXR exploit the conventional dimerization domains (the I-box) to interact with ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Recently, the DNA-binding pattern of the RXR was shown to be regulated by ligand-dependent modulation of its oligomeric state (dimer vs.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	160	 tetramer), and the tetramerization domain was defined to be distinct from the dimerization domain I-box (45).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Thus, further mutational studies within this newly defined tetramerization domain of RXR, as well as mapping the regions of ER essential for these interactions, will be required to clearly decode the oligomeric status of these ER heterocomplexes.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	162	The LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system presents two possible complications to study protein-protein interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	163	 First, the full-length LexA used in this system contains its own dimerization domain, which could complicate interpretation of the interaction results, particularly where dimerization is a prerequisite for two target proteins to interact with each other.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Second, this system cannot distinguish between genuine ligand-dependent protein-protein interactions and ligand-dependent transactivations.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	165	 For instance, the ligand-induced stimulations of the LacZ expressions when LexA/TR and B42/RXR-LBD were coexpressed were shown to reflect ligand-dependent transactivations mediated by the AF2 domains of TR and RXR (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	166	 With these complications, other methods such as the GST pull-downs should be employed to probe protein-protein interactions.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The interactions of ER with TR, RAR, and RXR were hormone-independent in both mammalian two-hybrid tests and GST pull-downs, suggesting that the seemingly hormone-dependent interactions in yeast (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	168	 1) may have been the hormone-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domains.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The T3-dependent stimulation of the LacZ expression with TR-LBD and ER-LBD coexpressed (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	170	 1A) may have also reflected the T3-dependent transactivations of the AF2 domain of TR.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The basal interactions between these proteins might have been too low to detect in the yeast system, which, however, became detectable with an aid from the activated transactivations of the AF2 domain upon T3 addition (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	172	 1A; see the results with LexA/ER-LBD and B42/TR-LBD).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	173	The physiological implications for these interactions have been accumulating.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	174	 For instance, manipulations of T3 and E2in vitro were shown to potentiate or mutually inhibit effects of gene expression (40, 46, 47).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Environmental conditions that alter levels of circulating T3, such as cold temperature, were also shown to alter E2-dependent female reproductive behavior (48, 49, 50, 51).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	176	 TR was recently shown to attenuate ER-mediated transactivations from the vit A2 consensus ERE, which is not necessarily dependent on DNA binding, as the TR DNA-binding mutant was still able to inhibit E2-dependent transactivation (52, 53).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, under similar conditions, we observed a modest enhancement of the ERE-mediated transactivations by either liganded or unliganded ER when cotransfected with TR (Fig.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The reasons for this discrepancy are not currently known.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In addition, retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (54, 55, 56).
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Nonadditive inhibition has been demonstrated between retinoids and antiestrogens, suggesting that each agent may produce common antiestrogenic effects.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Recently, synergistic interactions between HNF3 and HNF4 mediating apolipoprotein AI gene expression were shown to be further potentiated by cotransfected ER (57), in which the physical association of ER and HNF4, as described in this report, may play a role.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	182	 However, the physiological implications for the ER/SHP (D.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Moore, personal communications), ER/COUP-TF (31), and ER/ERR1 (32) interactions are not currently known.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	184	In conclusion, we found that ER directly binds to a subset of nuclear receptors through protein-protein interactions between ligand-binding domains, and these ER heterocomplexes led to differential regulation of transactivations by ER.
0.22530045.9717844.html.plaintext.txt	185	 From these results, we propose that ER is a common interaction partner for a subset of receptors, and these different ER heterocomplexes should mediate novel signaling pathways in vivo.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	3	 To understand the role of COUP-TFII in glucose homeostasis, conditional COUP-TFII-deficient mice were generated and crossed with mice expressing Cre under the control of rat insulin II gene promoter, resulting in deletion of COUP-TFII in pancreatic ss-cells.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Homozygous mutants died before birth for yet undetermined reasons.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Heterozygous mice appeared healthy at birth and showed normal growth and fertility.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	6	 When challenged intraperitoneally, the animals had glucose intolerance associated with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, these heterozygous mice presented a mild increase in fasting and random-fed circulating insulin levels.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In accordance, islets isolated from these animals exhibited higher insulin secretion in low glucose conditions and markedly decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Their pancreata presented normal microscopic architecture and insulin content up to 16 weeks of study.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	12	The function of differentiated ss-cells is dependent upon a network of transcription factors that are required for the expression of key genes involved in glucose sensing, insulin biosynthesis, and regulated exocytosis (1 to 4).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Disturbance of this network, even by mutations causing a modest decrease in the protein level, has been shown to lead to important clinical manifestations such as diabetes and/or obesity.

0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	15	 COUP-TFII is generally considered to be a functional transcriptional repressor of genes controlled by nuclear hormone receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4, which are well known to play important roles in the glucose-responsive phenotype of ss-cells (6,7).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The possibility that COUP-TFII might play a role in glucose homeostasis is supported by in vitro studies suggesting that this protein is involved in regulating insulin gene expression in pancreatic ss-cells (8) but also in the expression of several other genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (9,10).
0.4186047.15855320.html.plaintext.txt	17	 It has been shown that COUP-TFII is expressed in the early developing endocrine pancreas and in mature differentiated islet cells (11).

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Chromodomains in a variety of proteins mediate the formation of heterochromatin by interacting directly with histone H3, DNA, or RNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A diverse family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons possesses chromodomains in their integrases (IN), suggesting that the chromodomains may control integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The LTR-retrotransposon Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is highly active and possesses a chromodomain in the COOH terminus of its IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To test this chromodomain for a role in integration, recombinant INs with and without the chromodomain were assayed for activity in in vitro reactions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The full-length IN had integration activity with oligonucleotide substrates that modeled both the insertion reaction and a reverse reaction known as disintegration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The INs of retroviruses possess an additional activity termed 3' processing that must remove 2-3 nucleotides from the 3' ends of the viral cDNA before insertion can occur.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These additional nucleotides are added during reverse transcription because of the position of the minus strand primer downstream of the LTR.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The position of the primer for Tf1 suggests no nucleotides are added 3' of the LTR.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It was therefore surprising that Tf1 IN was capable of 3' cleavage.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The most unexpected result reported here was that the IN lacking the chromodomain had significantly higher activity and substantially reduced substrate specificity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results reveal that both the activity and specificity of enzymes can be modulated by their chromodomains.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Post-translational modifications of histones, such as the acetylation or methylation of lysines, establish the accessibility of DNA to the transcription machinery (1-3).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Conserved domains that recognize these specific modifications exist in a variety of factors that interact with the histones and propagate the structures of chromatin (4-6).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A large family of proteins that regulate chromatin structure bind specifically to histone H3 with methylated lysines using a conserved module called a chromodomain (6, 7).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although all the chromodomains studied thus far function to regulate chromatin structure, sequence analyses revealed large families of long terminal repeat (LTR)3-retrotransposons with chromodomains in the COOH termini of their INs (8, 9).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This is intriguing because it suggests that the transposons acquired chromodomains to regulate integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	19	LTR-retrotransposons are closely related to retroviruses.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Both types of elements encode Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase, and IN proteins and both depend on IN to insert their cDNA into the genome of a host cell.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The LTRs, positioned at the ends of the cDNA, are subdivided into an upstream segment, U3, a central region, R, and a downstream segment, U5.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A large number of biochemical studies with purified IN have characterized the chemistry of insertion (10-12).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The INs of retroviruses have two activities that are necessary for the integration of the viral cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	24	 At first, 2 or 3 nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the LTRs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This site-specific nucleolytic cleavage or "3' processing reaction" is required to position the "CA" dinucleotides at the 3' ends of the cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The CA dinucleotides are conserved among all retroviruses and their position at the 3' ends of the cDNA is required for the second step of retrovirus integration, the "strand transfer reaction.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	27	" During this second step, the 3' hydroxyls of the terminal "A" act as nucleophiles in a pair of transesterification reactions that cleave the phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA and simultaneously make a covalent bond between the 3' ends of the viral DNA and the 5' ends of the target DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	28	In retroviruses, the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription 2 or 3 nucleotides from the LTR and this results in additional nucleotides at the cDNA termini that IN removes during the processing reaction.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the case of most LTR-retrotransposons the minus strand primers initiate reverse transcription with no added nucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	30	 As a result, these LTR-retrotransposons are thought to proceed to the strand transfer reaction without a processing step (13).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	31	The INs of retroviruses have three protease-resistant domains and the functions of these domains have been studied extensively (12, 14, 15).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The NH2-terminal domain contains a conserved motif similar to zinc fingers.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although this domain does bind zinc, little else is known about its function.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The central domain is the catalytic core that contains highly conserved acidic residues, Asp, Asp, and Glu, that are juxtaposed on an RNase H-like fold.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These three amino acids are conserved in all the INs of retroviruses, LTR-retrotransposons, and DNA transposons (16).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The central domain of HIV-1 IN was shown to be sufficient for catalytic activity in in vitro assays for the reverse reaction of strand transfer known as disintegration (17).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The COOH-terminal domain is less well conserved but has nonspecific binding activity to DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Although the structure of individual domains has been determined for several INs, no single structure yet contains all three domains (18).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	39	Tf1 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is one of the LTR-retrotransposons that contains a chromodomain at the COOH terminus of IN (8).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Its high level of transposition activity allows Tf1 to be studied as a model for reverse transcription and integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Expression of Tf1 from a high copy plasmid results in the formation of virus-like particles, the reverse transcription of the Tf1 mRNA, and the integration of the cDNA into intergenic sequences (19-21).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	42	 A novel mechanism of self-priming initiates minus strand reverse transcription from the upstream LTR (22).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	43	 After initiation, reverse transcription proceeds through the same intermediates typical of other LTR elements.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	45	 pombe contains putative zinc binding, catalytic core, and COOH-terminal domains that are necessary for integration (23).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Mutation analysis indicated that its high level of activity and the tools available to study it make Tf1 uniquely suited for examining the function of the chromodomain in integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	47	In this report the activities of Tf1 IN and the function of its chromodomain were studied.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	48	 IN and IN without the chromodomain (CH-) were expressed in bacteria and purified.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Biochemical assays for disintegration and strand transfer showed that IN possessed substantial activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Because Tf1 cDNA was predicted to terminate with CA, it was surprising that IN also had strong 3' processing activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This indicates that the position of the minus strand primer relative to the LTR is not sufficient to predict the presence of processing activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The most unexpected result was that CH- had significantly higher specific activity than IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In addition, CH- was much less dependent on specific sequences at the termini of the donor DNA than was IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These results reveal that the chromodomain in the Tf1 IN modulates both the level and specificity of integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	55	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Plasmid Constructions and Cell Growth The construction of pHL2468, the plasmid for the expression of the full-length Tf1 IN has been previously described (19).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Briefly, the IN-coding DNA segment of Tf1 was amplified by PCR.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The resulting fragment was flanked with SalI sites that were introduced into the BamHI site of pET15B and sequenced.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The NH2 terminus of the Tf1 IN was predicted based on the amino terminus of the IN from a closely related element, Ty3 (24).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The NH2 terminus of the recombinant Tf1 IN started with the sequence TDDFK- and the COOH terminus ended with the sequence -NNLNI.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The resulting protein was 477 residues long and was fused at its amino terminus to a 21-residue peptide containing the His6 tag and the thrombin cleavage site.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The plasmid expressing CH-, pHL2469, generated by a similar method.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The CH-, coding DNA segment was amplified by PCR with the primers HL1167 and HL1168, using the Pfu Turbo thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The DNA generated was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, cloned into the vector pET15b, and sequenced.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The CH- protein had the same amino terminus as the full-length IN but ended with the sequence -RHNSE.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Altogether CH- was 406 + 21 (tag) residues long.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Both plasmids were introduced into the strain BL21.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The primer for the minus strand of Tf1 is positioned adjacent to the LTR so it is predicted that no processing activity is required (28, 29).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, sequences of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed the surprising result that 85% of the 3' ends had one or more untemplated nucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	207	4 Because these nucleotides are added to the 3' ends after the CA dinucleotide, they are expected to block integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	208	 We therefore speculated that Tf1 IN would have a processing activity that would remove these nucleotides to expose the CA dinucleotides and allow integration.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The 3' end extensions were either in the form of a single-stranded overhang (Ov) beyond the CA or they were base paired in the form of a blunt end (Bl).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	215	 The sequences of the extensions were chosen based on their presence at the 3' ends of the DNAs that were isolated in vivo from particles.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	216	 For example, the most prominent sequences observed after the U3 and U5 ends were "TT" and "AT," respectively.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The processing activity of IN produced the 24-nt sequence as the dominant product from the substrates with "tt," "at," "ttt," and "ttttt" as single-stranded extensions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In the one case of a substrate with a Bl end ("at"), IN generated the 24-nt species along with several other smaller products.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Because the increase in strand transfer requires enhanced 3' end processing, these data indicate that the 3' end processing activity of CH- is higher than that of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	253	The efficient processing of the U5 substrates suggested that the Tf1 proteins specifically recognized and removed the extensions beyond the CA dinucleotide.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	254	 To test whether other sequences in the substrate were recognized, IN and CH- were assayed for activity using a substrate with the U5 sequence of HIV-1 (Fig.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Processing activity would reduce the 21-nt species to 19 nt.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Compared with the processing activity of HIV-1 IN with this substrate, the Tf1 proteins exhibited very little activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	258	 This indicates that in addition to the CA dinucleotide, the Tf1 proteins recognize sequence in the U5 substrate specific for Tf1.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	259	 It was also seen that HIV-1 IN did not utilize the Tf1 pre-processed substrates (data not shown).

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	273	 However, the accumulated products of strand transfer would be an overestimate of processing if the Tf1 proteins could mediate strand transfer with substrates that retained nucleotide extensions 3' to the CA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	274	 To test this possibility, strand transfer reactions were conducted with substrates that possessed a2',3'-dideoxynucleotide at their 3' end.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Unless removed by processing, this substrate would lack the necessary 3' hydroxyl and as a result it would block strand transfer.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	305	 All the modifications introduced in the sequence led to a dramatic reduction of the strand transfer activity of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In sharp contrast to IN, CH- was capable of strand transfer with most of the substituted substrates.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Except for the substrate in which all three terminal nucleotides were flipped (tgt), CH- had greater than 10% of the activity observed with the unsubstituted substrate.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	316	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In this study the IN of the LTR-retrotransposon Tf1 was produced as a recombinant, soluble and enzymatically active protein.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Tf1 IN exhibited in vitro all the enzymatic activities expected for an IN from either a retrovirus or an LTR-retrotransposon.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The presence of a chromodomain in the COOH terminus of Tf1 IN provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of such a domain on IN activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Our results demonstrate that the chromodomain had a surprising influence on the specific activity of the IN as well as on its recognition of donor DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	320	Although the disintegration activity may not have direct biological relevance, it is particularly useful for biochemical characterization of INs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	321	 It provides a highly sensitive assay for the cleavage-ligation activity of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	322	 The disintegration assay developed here for Tf1 IN was used to optimize the reaction conditions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	323	 The increased activities of Tf1 IN with low concentrations of NaCl (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	324	 3A) were similar to what was observed with retroviral INs (26, 33).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Because magnesium is thought to be the important divalent metal in vivo, the preference Tf1 IN had for manganese might be the result of structural defects in the recombinant protein.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	326	 However, the preference for manganese could be a common property of INs as the INs of HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus also exhibit strong preferences for manganese over magnesium in vitro (26, 33).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	327	 The ability of HIV-IN to react efficiently with the Tf1 substrate (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	328	 2) suggested that the disintegration activity of HIV-1 IN had little sequence specificity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	329	 This is consistent with data from several studies indicating that beyond the requirement for the CA, the disintegration activity of retroviral INs is not sequence specific (25, 34-36).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	330	The full-length version of Tf1 IN was found to have substantial levels of strand transfer activity with both the U3 and U5 substrates.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	331	 The genomes of eukaryotes accumulate large numbers of inactive retrotransposons.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The strand transfer assay is a stringent test of IN function, and the activity of Tf1 IN detected here indicates that this protein was fully active.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Strand transfer assays with substrates containing nucleotides 3' to the CA revealed that the Tf1 IN also had 3' processing activity (Figs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	334	 This was observed with U3 and U5 substrates and with single and double-stranded extensions.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	335	 As is the case with the 3' end processing activity of HIV-1 IN, extensions longer than 2 nucleotides were more readily removed when they were single-stranded than when double-stranded (37).

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	340	  In one respect, the processing activity was quite unexpected.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	341	 It was thought that the 3' end processing activity of retroviruses and LTR-retrotransposons is required only in the cases where the priming of minus strand reverse transcription adds nucleotides beyond the conserved CA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	342	 For Tf1, the 3' end of the minus strand primer is immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of the upstream LTR (28, 29).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	343	 As a result, no extensions and no processing were thought to occur.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	344	 However, recent analyses of Tf1 cDNA extracted from particles revealed that 85% of the U3 and U5 ends terminated with nontemplated nucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	345	4 The processing activity of IN observed here could in theory remove these 3' extensions and allow the bulk of the cDNA to participate in integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	346	 This model raises the question why would nontemplated nucleotides be added just so they could be removed by IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	347	 One possibility is that the nontemplated nucleotides could prevent aberrant annealing of the 3' end to sequences in the opposite LTR and its subsequent extension.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	348	 As a result, the nontemplated nucleotides would protect the completed cDNA until IN initiates 3' processing.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Another possibility is that the nontemplated nucleotides could protect the conserved CA from attack by nonspecific 3' exonucleases.

0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	355	 The reactions were conducted either in the presence of the specified enzyme (+) or in the absence of enzyme (-).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	356	  The LTR-retrotransposon Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae does contain an IN with 3' processing activity and this was predicted based on the position of its minus strand primer (38).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Nevertheless, most other LTR-retrotransposons such as Ty1 have minus strand primers immediately adjacent to the U5 sequence of their LTR and are not thought to have processing (39).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	358	 The finding that Tf1 IN has processing activity brings into question the predicted lack of processing activity in the INs of the other LTR-retrotransposons.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Approximately 25% of Ty1 cDNA terminates with nontemplated nucleotides (40).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	360	 The cDNA with the nontemplated additions could participate in integration only if the IN has processing activity.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	361	 However, analyses of Ty1 IN failed to detect processing activity (41, 42).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	362	The removal of nontemplated nucleotides by IN may also occur with retroviral cDNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	363	 In vitro experiments show that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase possesses terminal transferase activity that adds nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' end of the nascent DNA (43-45).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	364	 A time course of reverse transcription during HIV-1 infection identified a prominent species of cDNA that had one nucleotide extra on the 3' end of the plus strand (46).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	365	 This led the authors to propose that the extra nucleotide was the result of nontemplated addition and that the 3' processing activity of IN removed it.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	366	Perhaps the most striking results presented in this report indicate a role for the chromodomain in modulating integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	367	 Although removing 15% of IN might be expected to reduce activity substantially, the deletion of the chromodomain resulted in a intriguing increase in the disintegration and strand transfer activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	368	 CH- also had greater 3' processing activity than IN, assuming that the greater amounts of strand transfer products generated were all derived from processed oligonucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Evidence supporting this assumption was that oligonucleotides with the blocking nucleotide (dd)c 3' of the CA were just as efficiently converted into products of strand transfer by CH- as oligonucleotides without the (dd)c block (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	370	 These data indicate that the chromodomain of Tf1 IN negatively modulates the IN activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	371	In addition to its role in limiting integration activity, the chromodomain had a significant impact in restricting the sequence at the 3' end of the donor DNA that could function in strand transfer.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Only when the chromodomain was present was there a strict requirement for the ACA at the 3' end of the donor DNA (Fig.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	373	 The strong specificity of the intact IN is in contrast to the IN of Ty1, which in similar types of assays can tolerate many alterations in the 3' end of the donor DNA (42).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	374	 However, INs of retroviruses, such as HIV-1, lack chromodomains and yet exhibit strict requirements for the sequences at the 3' end of the donor DNA (35, 37).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Thus, the chromodomain is not the only means for INs to achieve this strict requirement for the CA at the 3' end of donor oligonucleotides.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	376	 Therefore, it appears that in the case of Tf1 IN, the chromodomain evolved independently as a means of restricting donor sequences.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	377	Both contributions of the chromodomain, limiting IN activity and increasing sequence specificity, may result from a single mechanism that restricts access to the active site of IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Although there are several examples of chromodomains that interact directly with histone H3, the lack of histone proteins in our assays indicates such an interaction is not required for the restrictive properties of the Tf1 chromodomain.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Functional analyses of several chromodomains recently revealed an unexpected diversity of interaction targets such as DNA and RNA (7).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	380	 It is possible that the chromodomain of Tf1 restricts IN activity through interactions with the donor DNA.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Regardless of the mode of inhibition, there is the interesting possibility that in vivo, the inhibition is regulated.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	382	 One intriguing hypothesis is that the chromodomain does interact with histone H3 and it is this interaction at the target site that relieves the inhibitory function of the chromodomain.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	383	 The chromodomain of HP1 forms an organized cluster of strands and helices in response to its interaction with the NH2 terminus of H3 (32, 47).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	384	 This dramatic reorganization is consistent with a role in regulating integration.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	385	Although chromodomains are known to exist in many INs of LTR-retrotransposons (8, 9), the results reported here are the first direct effort to identify the function of the chromodomain in IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	386	 The restrictive role of the chromodomain identified here may very well be true for the other chromodomain containing INs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	387	 In addition to INs, chromodomains have been identified in several other enzymes.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	388	 The H3 lysine 9-specific histone methyltransferase Su(var)3-9, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, CHD, the DNA methyltransferase CMT, and the histone acetylase CDY, are all enzymes that contain chromodomains (7).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	389	 In light of the restrictive function of the chromodomain in Tf1 IN, it will be interesting to test how the chromodomains in these other proteins affect their enzymatic activities.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	390	The poor solubility of the recombinant INs studied thus far has been a major obstacle in producing high resolution structures.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	391	 High concentrations of salt or the introduction of amino acid substitutions have been necessary to solubilize individual domains of INs.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	392	 A number of structures have been determined for each of the three domains of the INs from the retroviruses HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, avian sarcoma virus, and Rous sarcoma virus (18).
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	393	 However, the lack of a structure for an intact IN makes it difficult to model the spatial relationships between the three domains.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	394	 During the purification of Tf1 IN it became clear that this IN was substantially more soluble than other integrases previously studied.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	395	 It is possible that this solubility will lead to the first crystal structure of a full-length IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	396	 This would serve as a significant leap in understanding the structures of INs in general and more specifically, of HIV-1 IN.
0.25489283.16188891.html.plaintext.txt	397	 A structure of an intact IN would substantially facilitate the design and development of new drugs against HIV IN and, thus, contribute to the ongoing fight against AIDS.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, October 7, 2003 , and in revised form, October 24, 2003.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) has an important role in regulating the expression of liver-specific genes.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Because bile acids are produced from cholesterol in liver and many enzymes involved in their biosynthesis are preferentially expressed in liver, the role of HNF4 in the regulation of bile acid production was examined.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In mice, unconjugated bile acids are conjugated with taurine by the liver-specific enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mice lacking hepatic HNF4 expression exhibited markedly decreased expression of the very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related gene (VLACSR), a mouse candidate for bile acid-CoA ligase, and BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This was associated with markedly elevated levels of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids in gallbladder.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HNF4 was found to bind directly to the mouse VLACSR and BAT gene promoters, and the promoter activities were dependent on HNF4-binding sites and HNF4 expression.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In conclusion, HNF4 plays a central role in bile acid conjugation by direct regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Bile acids (BAs)1 are synthesized from cholesterol mainly in hepatocytes by a cascade of enzyme reactions.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In humans, these reactions are initiated by steroid nucleus and side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol and followed by -oxidation of the side chain and resulting in the production of the primary BAs cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (1, 2).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In mice, cholic acid and -murichoric acid are the predominant primary BAs (3).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Following BA biosynthesis, BAs are conjugated with glycine or taurine resulting in conjugates that are exported from hepatocytes via hepatic BA transporters such as the bile salt export pump located at the apical or canalicular membrane (1, 4 to 6).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These BAs are stored in gallbladder and then transported into the small intestine.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	15	 BAs are biological detergents that serve to solubilize fats, sterols, and fat-soluble vitamins in the intestine.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Most BAs are recycled from the jejunum and ileum by transporters, such as apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (4, 7), and then transported back into hepatocytes from the portal circulation by transporters including sodium taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide (NTCP) and organic anion transporter polypeptide 1 (OATP1) located at the basolateral membrane (4).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	17	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor hormone superfamily that is mainly expressed in liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreas and regulates expression of target genes including several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipid, ammonia, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism by binding to direct repeat-1 elements in their promoter or enhancer regions (8, 9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Indeed, the expression of hepatic apolipoproteins, including A-II, A-IV, C-II, and C-III, ornithine transcarbamylase involved in ureagenesis, and CYP3A associated with xenobiotic metabolism, was significantly reduced in livers of liver-specific HNF4-null mice (10 to 12).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A second line of liver-specific HNF4-null mice was established where Cre recombinase was placed under the control of the albumin promoter and the -fetoprotein enhancer (13).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These mice exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of hepatic glycogen synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, involved in gluconeogenesis, and reduced levels of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and CEACAM1 proteins that are critical for normal liver morphology (13).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	21	Liver-specific HNF4-null mice in the adult exhibited increased serum BAs, and expression of the BA transporters, NTCP and OATP1, was also reduced in these mice (10).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Whereas BA biosynthesis and transport are controlled to some degree by HNF4, it remains unknown whether HNF4 regulates the BA conjugation pathway.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Nuclear receptors are involved in the control of the BA biosynthesis and transport system (6, 14, 15), but the mechanism regulating BA conjugation pathways have not been analyzed.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	24	 BA conjugation reactions are catalyzed by two liver-enriched enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase (BAL) and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) (1, 14).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	25	 BAL activities are associated with rat BAL protein (16) and human very long chain acyl-CoA synthase homolog 2 (VLACSR-H2) protein (17), but enzymatic analysis of BAL protein has not been performed in the mouse.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Because the mouse very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related (VLACSR) gene, which is highly expressed only in liver (18) as well as rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 genes, has a high homology to these proteins (16), it was reasonable to assume that the VLACSR gene might be the mouse homolog for the BAL gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	27	 On the other hand, BAT genes have been cloned from mouse (19), rat (20), and human (21).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The human BAT protein has conjugation activity with both taurine and glycine as substrates (21), but the mouse BAT protein only uses taurine as a substrate (19).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	29	In the present study, the biological function of HNF4 was investigated in vivo and in vitro using liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These mice exhibit increased unconjugated and glycine-conjugated BAs in gallbladder bile and decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Expression of the VLACSR and BAT was shown to be regulated directly by HNF4 via HNF4-binding sites in their promoter regions.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These results indicate that HNF4 has an important role in the maintenance of BA homeostasis by regulating BA conjugation pathways.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	33	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Animals and Treatment Liver-specific HNF4-null mice were generated as described previously (10).

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The enzyme activity of BAL has not been analyzed in mouse, but the mouse VLACSR gene might be a candidate for a mouse BAL since VLACSR has high homology to both the rat BAL and human VLACSR-H2 that have BAL activities.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Human BAT is able to conjugate both glycine and taurine (21), but mouse BAT has conjugation specificity toward taurine and not glycine (19).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Northern blots were performed to determine whether the expression of VLACSR and BAT is significantly different between liver-specific HNF4-null (HNF4-floxed/floxed, albumin-Cre; H4LivKO) and control (HNF4-floxed/floxed, without albumin-Cre; H4Flox) mice.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Most BAs in the H4Flox mice are also found as conjugated derivatives in gallbladder bile because only small amounts of free BAs were detected (Table I).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, free BAs were significantly increased in the gallbladders of H4LivKO mice (Table I), indicating that the conjugation enzymatic machinery of the BAs might be impaired by decreased expression of VLACSR in the livers of H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	150	The conjugation pattern of BA in gallbladder bile was further determined by LC-MS/MS (Table II).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In male H4Flox mice, taurocholic acid (TCA) and tauro--muricholic acid (T--MCA) were the predominant BAs.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The concentrations of these BAs (Table II, upper) were decreased in H4LivKO mice, but the total amounts (Table II, lower) were almost unchanged (TCA) or increased (T--MCA).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Most mammals secrete BAs conjugated with taurine and/or glycine, but mouse gallbladder bile contains only the taurine-conjugated forms (18).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, small amounts of glycine-conjugated BAs including glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were detected in the H4Flox mice, and their levels were much lower as compared with their taurine-conjugated derivatives.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In contrast to the results with control mice, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), GDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were increased in H4LivKO mice with GDCA and GCDCA being markedly elevated.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	156	 These results indicate that the conjugation pattern of BAs in H4LivKO mice is significantly different from H4Flox mice because of decreased expression of BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Because glycine-conjugated BAs are increased and taurine-conjugated BAs are maintained in H4LivKO mice, an unidentified BAT that can use both glycine and taurine as substrates might play an important role in H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	158	Expression of the Mouse VLACSR Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 To investigate why expression of VLACSR was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene was cloned (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	159	 A transcription start site was determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and five major sites were identified between  to 143 and  to 85 from translation start site (+1).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	160	 A putative HNF4-binding site and a GC box were found between  to 162 and  to 150 and  to 238 and  to 229, respectively (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	161	 To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse VLACSR promoter, several VLACSR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	162	 When HepG2 cells, which express HNF4, were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 146-bp fragment (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The promoter activities of the  to 220-bp fragment was higher than  to 194-bp fragment, indicating that the nucleotide sequence between  to 220 and  to 195 bp, which are GC-rich regions similar to the GC box between  to 238 and  to 229 bp, might be important for promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Furthermore, the promoter activities of the  to 256-,  to 1014-,  to 1435-, and  to 2219-bp fragments, which contain an HNF4-binding site and GC-rich sequences, were much higher than that of  to 194- and  to 220-bp fragments.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	165	 To determine whether HNF4 positively regulates the promoter activity, CV-1 cells, which do not express HNF4, were used.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The promoter activity of the  to 146-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4 expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4-binding site (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, the promoter activity of the  to 194-bp fragment was increased by cotransfection with an HNF4 expression vector.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The same results were obtained using the longer fragments, indicating that HNF4 positively regulates expression of the VLACSR gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Interestingly, the basal promoter activity of  to 220-bp fragment was increased in the absence of HNF4 expression, and the activity of  to 256-bp fragment was much higher.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Because a GC-rich sequence was observed in the region between  to 256 and  to 195 bp, the Sp1 family proteins might be important in activating maximal promoter activity in the presence of HNF4.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	184	 These results indicate that the HNF4-binding site in the mouse VLACSR promoter is capable of binding HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	185	To determine whether disruption of the HNF4-binding site and GC box decreases the promoter activity, mutations were introduced into the HNF4-binding site and GC box in the mouse VLACSR ( to 1014/ to 47)-luciferase construct (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	186	 4B, when HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased as compared with the wild-type construct ( to 1024/WT).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The promoter activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was further decreased, and the double mutants for both the HNF4-binding site and GC box ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) had almost no promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	188	 When CV-1 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the HNF4 mutant ( to 1014/HNF4 Mut) was decreased to 40% as compared with the wild-type fragment ( to 1014/WT) in the presence of HNF4 (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The basal activity of the GC box mutant ( to 1014/GC box Mut) was decreased to the same level as the promoterless vector, but the activity was still increased by HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Furthermore, introduction of mutations into the binding sites of both factors ( to 1014/HNF4/GC box Mut) caused a marked reduction of promoter activities even in the presence of HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	191	 These results indicate that the HNF4 and a GC box-binding protein can activate expression of the VLACSR gene, but both are needed for the maximal activation.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	192	Expression of the Mouse BAT Gene Is Directly Regulated by HNF4 In order to investigate why the expression of BAT was reduced in H4LivKO mice, the promoter region of the mouse BAT gene was cloned (Fig.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, the promoter activity of the 3078-bp fragment between the beginning of intron 1 and translation start site was not induced in HepG2 and CV-1 cells by cotransfection with HNF4 (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	195	 To determine whether HNF4 has the potential to activate the mouse BAT promoter, several BAT promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	196	 When HepG2 cells were used for transient transfections, the promoter activity of the  to 136-bp fragment containing a putative HNF4-binding site was higher than that of the promoterless construct (pGL3/basic) and the  to 52-bp fragment (Fig.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The promoter activities of the longer fragments were much higher than that of the  to 136-bp fragment.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	198	 To determine whether this effect was due to HNF4, CV-1 cells were used.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	199	 The promoter activity of the  to 52-bp fragment was unchanged by cotransfection of the HNF4-expression vector, consistent with the absence of an HNF4-binding site (Fig.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	221	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   BAs are synthesized by steroid nucleus and side chain hydroxylation of cholesterol followed by -oxidation of the side chain.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Because serum BA levels are significantly increased and expression of OATP1 and NTCP was decreased in liver-specific HNF4-null mice (10), HNF4 is likely a critical transcription factor regulating genes involved in BA biosynthesis.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In this study, HNF4 was also found to control the BA conjugation pathway by direct binding to the promoter regions of both the VLACSR and BAT genes and activation of their transcription.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	224	Because the levels of unconjugated (free) BAs are very low in gallbladder bile (22), increased levels of unconjugated BAs in liver-specific HNF4-null mice appear to be due to decreased expression of VLACSR and BAT.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Because VLACSR and BAT are preferentially expressed in liver (18, 19) as well as HNF4, HNF4 is a central factor in the regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	226	 An HNF4-binding site and a GC-rich region were identified in the promoter region of the mouse VLACSR gene.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Indeed, HNF4 binds to this HNF4-binding site, and the promoter activities were dependent on this site and expression of HNF4.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Furthermore, a GC-rich sequence was also important for maximal activation of the VLACSR gene because the mutated GC-rich sequence reduced its basal promoter activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	229	 It was reported that HNF4 and Sp1, a prototypical GC box-binding protein, binds to promoter regions of genes, including apolipoprotein C-III and CYP27, and increases their expression (23, 24).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	230	 In the mouse VLACSR promoter, HNF4 can still activate promoter activity when mutations were introduced into the GC box, but the resultant activity was much lower when compared with that of the wild-type promoter.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This result indicates that cooperative binding of HNF4 and Sp1 to the promoter might be required for maximal induction of VLACSR expression in the liver.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Furthermore, the expression of sterol carrier protein x, which is involved in the side chain -oxidation of BA, was also reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice, and Sp1 was identified as a critical factor regulating the sterol carrier protein x gene in an HNF4-independent manner (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Because expression of Sp1 and Sp3, typical GC box-binding proteins, was unchanged and VLACSR expression is markedly reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice (data not shown), post-transcriptional modification of Sp1 and/or Sp3 could reduce the expression of VLACSR in these null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	234	In addition to increased unconjugated BAs in serum, glycine-conjugated BAs such as GDCA and GCDCA were significantly increased in the gallbladder of liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Because mouse BAT has no glycine conjugation activity (19), expression of an unidentified BAT gene might be activated in H4LivKO mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Actually a few mouse genes that exhibit similarity to mouse BAT were cloned, but their function is still unknown.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Expression of one of these genes (GenBankTM accession number NM_145368 [GenBank] ) was found to be increased in the livers of H4LivKO mice (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	238	 However, it remains unclear whether this gene encodes an enzyme with glycine conjugation activity.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Furthermore, the physiological role of increased GDCA and GCDCA in H4LivKO mice also remains unclear, but these BAs in the intestinal lumen might change many aspects of intestinal and whole body cholesterol homeostasis.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	240	Recently it was reported (25) that a mutation of the BAT coding sequence causes human familial hypercholanemia that is characterized by elevated serum BA, and serum of homozygous individuals for this mutation contains only unconjugated BAs.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Because serum unconjugated BAs are increased, but most BAs in the gallbladder are conjugated forms in liver-specific HNF4-null mice, protein and enzyme activity of VLACSR and BAT might still be active in these mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In human disease, mutations in the HNF4-binding sites were reported in HNF1, blood coagulation factor VII, and IX (9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Because HNF4 regulates many liver-enriched genes, human diseases might be found to be caused by mutations of the HNF4-binding sites in the VLACSR and BAT genes.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	244	It was reported that the expression of BAL and BAT is induced by treatment with ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in rat, and this induction was due to the binding of FXR to FXR-binding sites in their promoter regions (26).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Because this phenomenon was not observed in mouse, regulation of both genes by FXR exhibits a species difference between rat and mouse (26).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Actually, neither VLACSR nor BAT gene was induced in wild-type mice treated with cholic acid, a ligand for FXR (data not shown).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Unlike other nuclear receptors including FXR, HNF4 is constitutively activated in vivo and in vitro without exogenous compounds (9).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Thus, HNF4 positively regulates the basal levels of expression of the VLACSR and BAT genes.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It may also be involved in the regulation of transporters such as OATP1 and NTCP that are required for hepatocyte uptake of conjugated BAs from the portal circulation (Fig.

0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Most bile acids are recycled and transported from the portal circulation back into hepatocytes by transporters including NTCP and OATP1 located at the basolateral membrane.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Expression of OATP1, NTCP, VLACSR, and BAT is reduced in liver-specific HNF4-null mice.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Note that HNF4 directly regulates the expression of VLACSR and BAT via HNF4-binding sites in their promoters.
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	256	  Many nuclear receptors including FXR are involved in regulating the BA biosynthesis pathway and transport system (6, 14, 15).
0.22037566.14583614.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Thus, these nuclear receptors also might have important roles in inducing or repressing the expression of VLACSR and BAT to regulate the BA conjugation pathway.

0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Transcription factors belonging to the steroid/nuclear hormone receptor superfamily regulate gene expression in response to a variety of signaling molecules (such as steroids, thyroid hormone, retinoids, vitamin D3 and lipid metabolites) by binding to specific response elements (REs) of their target genes (1 to 3).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These REs include direct repeats of RG(G/T)TCA with 0 to 5 base spacing, palindromic RG(G/T)TCA without any spacing or single half sites (2,3).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Of these REs, direct repeats of RG(G/T)TCA with one base spacing (DR1) appear to be highly promiscuous, as they bind a number of nuclear receptors including RXR, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4), COUP-TFI, apolipoprotein regulatory protein 1 (ARP-1/COUP-TFII) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (3,4).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	12	 These transcription factors bind to DR1 as homodimers (RXR, COUP-TFI, ARP-1 and HNF4) or heterodimers (PPAR to RXR, RAR to RXR, COUP-TFI to RXR and ARP-1 to RXR) and, as a result, genes harboring the DR1 element in their promoters can be activated constitutively by HNF4, repressed by COUP-TFI and ARP-1 or activated by the ligands of PPAR and RXR (5 to 10).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Nucleotides at base positions 1, 2 and 4 of the core motif, the spacer sequence and the location of the element within a proper promoter context were shown to determine the selective binding of these transcription factors (10).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In addition, relative abundance of these transcription factors in a given tissue also plays a major role in the regulation of their target genes (5,7).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	15	Several studies demonstrate that protein to protein and protein to DNA interactions of the nuclear receptors binding to the DR1 element result in positive or negative regulation of several hepatic genes (5,6,11).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	16	 For example, HNF4, ARP-1 and COUP-TFI compete for binding to a DR1 element within the apolipoprotein CIII promoter and while HNF4 stimulates transcription, ARP-1 and COUP-TFI function as transcriptional repressors (5,6).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although COUP-TFI is generally known as a transcriptional repressor, it has been shown to activate transcription from the SV40 promoter as well as from a DR1 element present in the promoter of the gene encoding ornithine transcarbamylase (12).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the case of the gene encoding murine cellular retinol binding protein II (CRBPII), an HNF4/ARP-1 RE was shown to function as a promiscuous binding site for RXR and is inducible by retinoic acid only in cells expressing low levels of HNF4/ARP-1 (7).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Co-expression of PPAR and HNF4 results in suppression of HNF4-mediated transactivation from the acyl CoA oxidase promoter and only HNF4 but not PPAR can activate transcription from the apolipoprotein CIII promoter (11).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Similarly, ARP-1 or COUP-TFI repress HNF4-mediated transactivation from the human factor IX promoter and impaired HNF4 binding is one of the factors responsible for down-regulation of factor IX expression (13).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These studies suggest that cross-talk amongst DR1-binding nuclear receptors can lead to significant differences in the level of expression of their target genes in different tissues.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The fact that almost all the receptors that bind to the DR1 element are expressed in liver (7) suggests that transcription of their target genes will ultimately depend on the concentration and affinity of these receptors for their recognition sites, as well as protein to protein interactions with other factors binding to proximal and distal regulatory elements.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Thus, regulation of hepatic gene expression by these DR1-binding nuclear receptors appears to be a complex process.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	24	Most of the data on cross-talk amongst receptors binding to the DR1 element is generated from studies involving co-transfection of reporter plasmids and plasmids expressing nuclear receptors.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, many control mechanisms that operate in differentiated tissues do not operate in the rapidly dividing cells in culture and, even when appropriate cell lines exist, all the regulation exerted on endogenous genes may not be reproduced on transfected DNA (14).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This is especially true in the case of liver cells, which rapidly lose transcription factors involved in the regulation of liver-specific genes such as albumin when cultured in vitro (14).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	27	 One of the alternative methods involves the study of transcriptional regulation of genes in vitro using nuclear extracts prepared from differentiated tissues.

0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Amongst these, SRC-1, CBP and GRIP-1 have been shown to play a role in HNF4-mediated transactivation (30 to 32).

0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	182	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   One of the characteristic features of nuclear receptors is their ability to regulate gene expression by binding to unique REs in the promoters of their target genes (1).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, certain REs are recognized by more than one receptor and in such cases co-existence of these receptors in the same cell type results in cross-coupling of nuclear receptor signaling (2,3).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	184	 For example, promiscuous binding of HNF4, RXR, COUP-TFI, ARP-1 and PPAR-RXR to DR1 elements present in the promoters of several genes can alter their gene expression patterns in different tissues (4 to 21).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Liver is an ideal tissue to study cross-talk amongst DR1-binding nuclear receptors since a majority of such receptors are expressed in liver and are implicated in the regulation of several hepatic genes (34).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	186	 So far, there has been no report on the study of DR1-mediated in vitro transcription using cell-free extracts derived from rat liver.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous DR1-binding transcription factors present in rat liver nuclear extracts can activate transcription in vitro.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Addition of recombinant HNF4 to this cell-free system results in enhancement of DR1-mediated transcription over and above that observed with endogenous HNF4.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Depletion of endogenous DR1-binding proteins abrogates DR1-dependent transactivation and addition of recombinant HNF4 to such extracts restores DR1-dependent transactivation.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	190	 These observations indicate that HNF4 is the major transcription factor involved in DR1-dependent transactivation in this cell-free transcription system.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	191	 HNF4 activates transcription from the rat CRBPII promoter as well, which harbors promiscuous binding sites (RE1, RE2 and RE3) for several DR1-binding transcription factors (7).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Deletion of a region containing RE1 and RE2 has no effect on HNF4 activation of the CRBPII promoter.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, deletion of a region containing RE3 results in a drastic decrease in HNF4-mediated transactivation.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Thus, RE3 present between  to 105 and  to 52 bp is the major cis-acting element involved in HNF4-mediated transactivation of the rat CRBPII promoter.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	195	 These results are significant in view of the conflicting reports on murine CRBPII gene regulation (7,8).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	196	 While RE1 was shown to mediate 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transactivation of the rat CRBPII gene by RXR in F9 cells (8), RE2 and RE3 were identified as the major regulatory elements of the mouse CRBPII gene (7).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Our results indicate that RE1 and RE2 are dispensable and RE3 is the major regulatory element through which HNF4 activates rat CRBPII gene transcription.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	198	 While our results are in agreement with those reported by Nakshatri and Chambon (7), we wish to point out that the CRBPII gene is expressed only in the neonatal liver and adult intestine but not in the adult liver.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, while HNF4 is able to activate CRBPII gene transcription in rat liver nuclear extracts, tissue-specific gene silencing mechanisms that are operational in vivo may prevent HNF4 from activating CRBPII gene transcription in the adult rat liver.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	200	 The fact that DR1-dependent transactivation can be restored in liver nuclear extracts with depleted levels of endogenous DR1-binding proteins by the addition of recombinant HNF4 indicates that this cell-free system can be used to further dissect the mechanism of hepatic gene regulation by HNF4 without interference from other DR1-binding receptors.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	201	 To this end, we examined the role of coactivators in HNF4-mediated transactivation in rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Research in the last decade has led to the identification of several nuclear receptor coactivators (NCoAs) as well as nuclear receptor corepressors (29).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Analysis of domains involved in the interaction between NCoAs and nuclear receptors indicated that an LXXLL motif is both necessary and sufficient for ligand-dependent interaction of several NCoAs with nuclear receptors (25,28 to 33).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Since several NCoAs contain an LXXLL motif, we examined the involvement of such protein factors in HNF4-mediated transactivation in rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Our study indicates that a peptide containing the LXXLL motif inhibits HNF4-mediated transactivation in vitro.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	206	 It is logical to conclude that the repression is due to competition between an endogenous LXXLL-containing coactivator(s) and the peptide for binding to HNF4.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus, an LXXLL-containing coactivator(s) appears to be involved in HNF4-mediated transactivation in rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These results are significant in view of the reports that LXXLL-containing coactivators, such as CBP, SRC-1 and GRIP-1, have been shown to be involved in HNF4 function in vivo (30 to 32).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Whether these coactivators are involved in transactivation by HNF4 in rat liver nuclear extracts is not clear.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Our attempts to characterize the coactivator involved in transactivation by HNF4 in rat liver nuclear extracts have not been successful thus far.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Addition of antibodies to CBP or SRC-1 did not affect HNF4-mediated transactivation in this cell-free system under conditions where addition of HNF4 antibodies readily inhibited transactivation from pDR1-AdMLP380 (data not shown).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Thus, further studies are needed to characterize the coactivator(s) involved in HNF4 activation in rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	213	This study clearly demonstrates that the cell-free system derived from rat liver nuclear extracts can be a useful tool for the study of regulation of hepatic gene expression by DR1-binding nuclear receptors in general and HNF4 in particular.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	214	 While we have focussed our attention on HNF4 activation in this study, this cell-free system can also be used to study transactivation by other DR1-binding nuclear receptors such as RXR, ARP-1, COUP-TF, PPAR-RXR etc.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We have used only naked DNA templates in this study but it will be interesting to study transcriptional regulation by HNF4 from chromatin templates in rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The ligand-independent activation of HNF4 demonstrated in this study also opens up new opportunities to study the role of ligands in modulating HNF4 function since long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters were shown to modulate HNF4 function in HeLa nuclear extracts (35).
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The cell-free system described in this study differs from that derived from HeLa cells in that the latter does not express HNF4.
0.48113066.11222753.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Since HNF4 is a major regulator of several hepatic genes, a cell-free system derived from liver is well suited for the study of hepatic gene regulation by HNF4 and identification of its ligands.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Mutation analyses showed that the HNF1 site is essential for HNF1 transactivation and is required for full basal enhancer activity, as is the C/EBP site.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Glucocorticoid response element consensus sites which overlap the C/EBP, HNF4 and HNF3 sites are crucial for optimal hormonal induction.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We present a model that accounts for weak expression of HNF41 in the embryonic liver and strong expression in the newborn/adult liver via the binding sites identified in the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   HNF4, a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (1), is one of the first liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF) to be expressed during the course of development.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Indeed, transcripts are observed in the mouse at embryonic day (E)4.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	12	5 in the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm and in embryonic tissues in the liver and gut primordia at around E8.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A somewhat earlier and overlapping expression pattern characterizes HNF3ss and HNF1ss, respectively, the only other LETF to have such precocious expression (3 to 6).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Each of the three factors is essential for normal embryogenesis: targeted mutation of the corresponding genes causes an early embryonic lethal phenotype (3 to 7), due in the cases of HNF4 and HNF1ss to disruption of visceral endoderm function, essential for the progression of gastrulation (4,5,8).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition, HNF4 is required for the expression of a number of essential liver functions of differentiated hepatocytes (9).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Alteration of some of these functions may be involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1 (MODY1), linked to HNF4 insufficiency (10,11).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HNF4 mutations linked to MODY1 affect the coding region of the protein.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, mutations in regulatory regions of the gene may yet be identified (reviewed in 12), providing a strong impetus to locate and characterize these sequences.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In view of the importance of HNF4 for execution of the hepatocyte differentiation program, as well as its early expression pattern, the search for regulators of the HNF4 gene should inform us of the factors that are critical not only for hepatocyte differentation and function, but for endoderm formation as well.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	20	Relatively little information is available concerning the regulation of expression of the HNF4 gene.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A series of up to 10 DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in adult liver chromatin, spread out over 15 kb of DNA upstream of the start of transcription of HNF41, the initially isolated isoform (1), implies that its regulation is complex (13,14).

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	23	 While the long fragment and deletions down to  to 228 bp showed similar activity in transient expression assays, only the long fragment conferred appropriate activity to a reporter gene in transgenic mice.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These results imply that the distal HS harbor important regulatory sites for HNF41 expression.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Several splice variants of HNF4 have been described (reviewed in 12), so it is assumed that all of the HNF4 variants concern alternative splicing events within a single gene region.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, the most recently described of them, HNF47, contains a unique sequence encoding the N-terminal portion of the protein and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), implying that it is transcribed from a separate promoter (15).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	27	We have analyzed the regulatory role of distal sequences upstream of the HNF41 promoter and characterized a 700 bp enhancer conferring high activity and glucocorticoid induction to both a heterologous and the HNF41 promoter.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We have found LETF binding sites and glucocorticoid-responsive sequences essential for enhancer activity in a 240 bp sub-region.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Our results are in line with the requirement for upstream sequences for tissue-specific activity of the HNF41 promoter (14) and with glucocorticoid induction of HNF41 expression (11,15) and lead us to propose a model of biphasic regulation of this enhancer involved in HNF41 expression during liver development.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Essentially full activity, again limited to FGC4 cells, was conserved by the proximal fragment, B1E5.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Finally, B1E5 was divided into two fragments and full activity in FGC4 cells was retained by the more proximal fragment, B1E5B2.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This fragment, covering one HS (13,14), therefore acts as a cell-specific enhancer and is referred to as the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	105	Since we had observed that transcription of the endogenous HNF4 gene of rat hepatoma cells is induced by Dex treatment (data not shown), each of the fragments was tested for Dex inducibility (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Dex induction was observed only in FGC4 (2 to 3-fold) and not in H5 cells and, with one exception, it was found only for the most active fragments.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The only fragment with low basal activity that showed inducibility was B1E4, which covers HS V (13).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This fragment has not yet been studied further.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	109	To test whether the 700 bp enhancer can act on the homologous promoter, we cloned it in front of the  to 34/+182 HNF41 sequence in plasmid  to 34pZLUC (14).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The 5' deletion to  to 34 retained non-tissue-specific promoter activity (14).

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Moreover, Dex treatment increased the activity of the 700/ to 34pZLUC constructs 2-fold, which accounts totally for the Dex induction of  to 6.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	114	A 240 bp region is sufficient for enhancer activity and Dex inducibility and is transactivated by HNF1 and HNF41 Deletions were performed in the 700 bp enhancer to delineate the sequences that are critical for basal and inducible expression (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Concerning the 5' and 3' deletions, in BspEI and B1E5A2 basal activity was strongly reduced compared to that of the 700 bp enhancer and hormone inducibility was abolished.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The sequences deleted between HpaI and DraI had a negative effect on both basal and induced activity because their loss led to increased activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Further deletion from DraI to AvaI caused a strong decline in both basal and hormone-induced activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	118	 An internal deletion, (BspEI to StuI), also strongly reduced both basal and induced activities compared to the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Therefore, three adjacent blocks of sequence lying between the PvuII and DraI sites are important for full basal and hormone-induced activity of the 700 bp enhancer, with the most 5' one (PvuII to BspEI) being the most critical for the Dex response.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Analysis of two central fragments, PvuII to DraI and BspEI to DraI, confirmed that an element required for hormone response is located between the PvuII and BspEI sites.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	121	 None of the fragments shown in Figure 2A exhibited strong enhancer activity in dedifferentiated H5 cells in the absence or presence of Dex (data not shown).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	122	Because it is known that the HNF4 gene is subject to cross-regulation by HNF1 and to auto-regulation (24,39 to 42), several of the fragments were tested for transactivation by HNF1 and HNF41.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	123	 The 700 bp enhancer is transactivated by both factors in H5 (Fig.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Analysis of deleted constructs in H5 cells (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	126	 2A) shows that the HNF4 response element is located between the PvuII and BspEI sites and the HNF1 element between the AvaI and DraI sites.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In addition, in H5 cells the 700 bp enhancer is transactivated similarly by HNF41 and HNF47 and less efficiently by HNF1ss than HNF1 (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	128	In conclusion, these results show that the 700 bp enhancer is transactivated by HNF41, HNF47, HNF1 and HNF1ss.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Furthermore, the 240 bp PvuII to DraI sequence contains HNF4 and HNF1 response elements and acts as a cell-specific enhancer whose activity is increased by glucocorticoids.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	130	Hepatoma cell nuclear proteins bind to the 240 bp enhancer DNase I footprint experiments were performed to search for binding sites of nuclear proteins in the 700 bp enhancer.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Due to the location of F1 very close to the labeled end of the probe, its 3'-limit is not clearly visible.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, using a probe labeled further downstream on the same strand we precisely located the 3'-end of F1 (data not shown).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	134	 There is a surprising similarity between the footprints obtained with the two extracts.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	232	A functional HNF1 binding site is essential for basal enhancer activity The 700 and 240 bp enhancers are similarly transactivated by HNF1.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	233	 A computer search for putative HNF1 binding sites in the 700 bp sequence using a weighted matrix (44) revealed three sites with high scores.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The most upstream contains the DraI site and the three last bases of the consensus (15 bp) were replaced by vector sequence in cloned fragments cut by DraI.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The second HNF1 site is located a few base pairs downstream of the DraI site and the third lies 70 bp further downstream (data not shown).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In DNase I footprinting experiments using purified recombinant truncated HNF1 protein (HNt) we demonstrated that the two most upstream consensus sites correspond to authentic HNF1 binding sites (BS1 and BS2, respectively; data not shown).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Then we tested the recombinant HNF1 protein by EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing BS1, wild-type (oligo BS1) or mutated (oligo BS1m) in order to abolish HNF1 binding (27).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	238	 A complex between HNt and labeled oligo BS1 formed which was competed by PE56 and oligo BS1, but not by oligo BS1m (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	239	 From these experiments we conclude that BS1 binds HNF1, but with an efficiency  > 16-fold lower than the high affinity PE56 oligonucleotide.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In the constructs 3' deleted at the DraI site, modified BS1 still binds to HNt but with a lower affinity (data not shown).

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	251	  To investigate whether BS1 could mediate transactivation by HNF1 we used oligo BS1m to mutate BS1 in the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	252	 We obtained two mutant reporter plasmids of which one (BS1m*) contains an insertion of two G residues within BS1 in addition to the expected mutation.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	253	 As shown in Figure 7B, in H5 cells this mutant plasmid exhibited the same low basal activity as the B1E5B2 reporter plasmid but transactivation by co-transfected HNF1 was severely compromised, in spite of the continued presence of intact BS2 and BS3 sites.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Moreover, activity of both mutant plasmids in FGC4 was strongly and similarly reduced compared to the wild-type (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	255	 These results thus show that BS1 is required not only for transactivation by HNF1, but also for enhancer activity of the 700 bp region in differentiated hepatoma cells.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	256	In summary, we have characterized several LETF binding sites (Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	257	 8A) within the 700 bp enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	258	 C/EBP, HNF4 and HNF3 binding sites are located in the 240 bp minimal enhancer, PvuII to DraI, whereas an HNF1 binding site overlaps its 3'-end and two other HNF1 binding sites lie further downstream.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The C/EBP site and the first (BS1) HNF1 site are required for full basal activity.

0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	269	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In this work we have defined an enhancer element upstream of the HNF41 promoter that is active in well-differentiated FGC4 rat hepatoma cells and not in dedifferentiated variant hepatoma and non-hepatic cells.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Fragments covering  to 5 to  to 11 kb upstream of the transcription start site have been tested upstream of the tk promoter and full activity can be localized to a fragment of 700 bp (700 bp enhancer) at around  to 6 kb, which corresponds to a HS of both liver and kidney chromatin (13,14).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This fragment increases the activity of a minimal HNF41 promoter from which the HNF1 site (14) has been deleted.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This result agrees with the requirement of upstream sequences up to  to 7 kb to obtain liver- and kidney-restricted activity of the HNF41 promoter in transgenic mice (14).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Moreover, the 700 bp enhancer mediates glucocorticoid induction, but only in differentiated hepatoma cells.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	274	 This agrees with the reported glucocorticoid induction of HNF4 expression (11,15).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The 700 bp enhancer is thus implicated in physiological regulation of HNF41 activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	276	The 700 bp enhancer contains a 240 bp core sequence sufficient for both enhancer activity and Dex induction and within which three footprints (F1 to F3) have been identified.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	277	 C/EBP binds to F1, HNF4 to F2 and HNF3 to F3.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Finally, a functional HNF1 binding site is at the 3'-end of the core sequence.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Figure 8A summarizes these data.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The sequence comprising the minimal enhancer is conserved.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Blast analysis of the mouse and human (NCBI database accession no.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	282	 AL117382) sequences showed an overall 86% identity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	283	 The F1 to F3 and HNF1 sites exhibit the highest scores (90 to 100%).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	284	 This fact implies that the HNF41 enhancer is an important element that plays a similar role in humans.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	285	The C/EBP site is the strongest footprint in the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Its mutation significantly reduces enhancer activity but only in cells that produce C/EBP, implying that this site responds specifically to binding of C/EBP.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Previously we proposed that HNF4 regulates its own expression based on studies of stable transfectants (24,42).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Our data here support such a direct auto-regulation mechanism because the enhancer core sequence contains a functional HNF4 response element.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In addition, HNF3 transactivates the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	290	 However, while mutation of the HNF4 and HNF3 sites had only small effects, the introduced mutations impaired binding of the factors only partially.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The HNF41 enhancer is strongly transactivated by HNF1 and more weakly by HNF1ss.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Transactivation by HNF1 is mediated by a weak HNF1 binding site, which is also required for high basal activity of the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	293	 A similar functional role of weak HNF1 binding sites has been reported for the mouse phenylalanine hydroxylase gene enhancer (21).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	294	 A functional HNF1 binding site in the HNF41 enhancer, in addition to the site described earlier in the promoter region (14), accords with earlier reports of cross-regulation between HNF4 and HNF1 (39 to 42).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Based on the strong response to HNF1, we propose that this factor plays a critical role in enhancer activity.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	296	In agreement with our observations, glucocorticoids have been shown to activate HNF4 expression in primary cultured rat hepatocytes (11).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Moreover, HNF41, but not HNF47, is induced by glucocorticoids in murine hepatic cells (15).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Maximal Dex induction of the enhancer requires the F1 to F3 region where three imperfect GRE and five imperfect half-GRE consensus sites were found, some overlapping with the F1 to F3 footprints (see Fig.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Although competition EMSAs using GRE failed to provide evidence for binding of GR, the presence of GRE consensus sites and responsiveness to Dex imply that GR binds to the enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Indeed, mutations introduced into LETF binding sites that affect GRE whole sites or half-sites compromised Dex induction, implying that these sites are functional.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Moreover, induction of the 700 bp enhancer was restricted to differentiated hepatoma cells, implying that a liver-specific protein(s) is required for the glucocorticoid effect.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Indeed, the LETF can synergize with GR to achieve glucocorticoid induction of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (45 to 47) and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (48).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	303	 A similar situation appears to exist for the HNF41 enhancer.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	304	At first sight, it is surprising to observe that the major transactivators for the HNF41 enhancer are hormone-activated GR and LETF that are expressed late in development, such as C/EBP and HNF1, even though it is known that HNF4 transcripts are first detected very early (2).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	305	 However, probes that do not distinguish between the HNF41 and HNF47 isoforms were used for analysis of early embryos.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Recent work from our laboratory has revealed that expression of the HNF41 isoform is strong in the liver only at the end of fetal life and at birth, whereas the HNF47 isoform is the predominant form of HNF4 in embryonic liver (M.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	307	Weiss, submitted for publication).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The dramatic activation of HNF41 that occurs just before birth could be assured, on the one hand, by C/EBP, whose expression is also activated at birth (49), and, on the other, by glucocorticoids.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Indeed, the TAT and PEPCK genes, which like HNF41 have enhancers in which glucocorticoid hormone response modules overlap LETF sites (46 to 48), are strongly induced by glucocorticoids at birth.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	310	HNF41 is thus expressed at low levels in embryonic liver.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Binding sites in the HNF41 enhancer do include transcription factors that are present in the developing liver.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	312	 HNF3 and ss are among the first LETF to be expressed in this tissue (50).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	313	 HNF1ss, known to be expressed before HNF1 in the embryonic liver (4,5), is a transactivator of the enhancer, as is HNF47.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	314	Although many studies have contributed to the notion that the group of LETF is subject to cross-regulation and to auto-regulation (4,5,8,9,14,24,30,31,34,35,39 to 42,51 to 63), this is the first detailed study of an enhancer regulating expression of one of these factors.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Furthermore, this analysis concerns one of the first of these factors to be expressed, HNF4 (2).
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	316	 The results of this study are entirely consistent with the observed behavior of the HNF4 gene in vivo and provide a basis to explain its expression pattern.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Indeed, binding sites for essentially all of the LETF so far identified are present, including factors expressed early during development, such as HNF3 and ss, HNF1ss and HNF47, and others that are expressed a little later, such as HNF1, and in particular those that are up-regulated at birth, including C/EBP, HNF41 and, perhaps most importantly, activated GR.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Consequently, the properties of the  to 6 kb enhancer are consistent with it being involved both in the initiation of expression of HNF41 and in its maintenance.
0.22947337.11522818.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Figure 8B presents our model of biphasic regulation of the HNF41 enhancer during liver development.

0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	211	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Our results showed that MODY1-associated mutations R154X and E276Q in the HNF4 gene impair the functional cooperation and physical interaction between HNF4 and p300.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In the case of the R154X mutant, this impairment can be ascribed to the lack of AF-2, which plays a crucial role in the recruitment of p300 as discussed below.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In the case of the E276Q mutant, this impairment is ascribed to an alteration of the interaction and cooperation between p300 and the D to E domains, which are required for full activity of the HNF4 AF-2 activation function.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Impairment of the p300-mediated potentiation of HNF4 transcriptional activity is of particular importance for the E276Q mutant of which the intrinsic transcriptional activity (without exogenously supplied coactivators) is moderately affected (33, 35) by comparison with that of the R154X mutant (35, 36).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Another MODY1-associated HNF4 mutant, R127W, was shown recently to have no effect on the p300-mediated enhancement of HNF4 activity (37).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The localization of this mutation in the HNF4 DBD (aa 50 to 142), which does not interact with CBP/p300 (21), may account for the lack of change in CBP/p300 recruitment.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	217	Many authors who study the interaction and cooperation between nuclear receptors and their coactivators assume that they act synergistically when their combined effects on enhancement of transcription of the target promoter are higher than the sum of their individual effects.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that other models of interaction may be involved in p300 recruitment by HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Whatever the mechanism involved in this interaction, our results clearly showed that recruitment of p300, which has been shown to be essential for transcription by HNF4, was impaired by the studied HNF4 mutations.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	220	The ability of CBP/p300 to interact with the HNF4 AF-1 in the context of the chimera GAL4 (AF-1)2x has been shown previously (14).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	221	 CBP/p300 interacts with the HNF4 fragments 1 to 128 (21) and 1 to 153 (present work), which contain the AF-1.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Our results showing significant decreases in interaction and cooperation between R154X and p300 by the mutation F19D indicate unambiguously that the AF-1 is actually involved in p300 recruitment to this truncated HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	223	 In addition, our results extend these findings by demonstrating for the first time that the HNF4 AF-1 activity can be enhanced by p300.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	224	Mutation F19D resulted in a 50% decrease of full-length HNF42 activity despite the presence of the AF-2, a result consistent with that of Green et al.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	225	 (14) and which confirms the crucial role of the AF-1 in the transcriptional activity of full-length HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The AF-1 role in full-length HNF4 activity does not depend on p300 recruitment since the F19D mutation did not alter the p300-mediated enhancement of full-length HNF4 transcriptional activity.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	227	 This result fits with those obtained by Dell and Hadzopoulou-Cladaras (21) using a complete deletion of the AF-1.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	228	 It appears therefore that, even if p300-mediated potentiation of truncated HNF4 lacking the AF-2, i.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	229	 R154X, is exerted through the AF-1, p300-mediated potentiation of HNF4 proteins containing the AF-2 is exerted mainly through this latter activation function.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This suggests that, in the context of full-length HNF4, the p300-mediated enhancement of AF-2 activity is strong enough to compensate for the decrease in cooperation between p300 and the AF-1 by the F19D mutation.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	231	 This hypothesis is supported by the drop of 60% in cooperation between p300 and full-length HNF4 due to the E276Q mutation located in the D to E domains required for full activity of the AF-2.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The role of the AF-1 in the CBP/p300 action is much more crucial for other nuclear receptors than for HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Indeed, CBP/p300-mediated potentiation of AF-1 plays a major role in the transcriptional activities of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor-, and estrogen receptor-ss since mutations in AF-1 cause reductions in ligand-induced functional synergism between their AF-1 and AF-2 mediated by CBP/p300 (38, 39).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	234	Previous mapping of CBP sequences interacting with full-length or truncated HNF4 used either a CBP fragment spanning the sequence 271 to 451 (20) and corresponding to sequence 251 to 436 of p300 (23) or a CBP fragment spanning the sequence 1 to 771 (14, 21).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	235	 We have shown that the p300 sequence 340 to 528 is sufficient for binding full-length HNF4 as well as HNF4 fragments encompassing sequences 1 to 153 and 128 to 369 containing the AF-1 and AF-2, respectively.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Interestingly, we have observed that within the p300 fragment spanning residues 340 to 528, the sequence 340 to 354, which contains a LXXLL motif, is required for efficient interaction with the full-length HNF4 and the HNF4(128 to 369) fragment containing the AF-2.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Our results thus allow a more precise mapping of sequences of p300 involved in its interaction with HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	238	We have observed that the HNF4 AF-2 plays a crucial role in interaction with the p300(340 to 528) fragment, whereas Dell and Hadzopoulou-Cladaras have shown that interaction of the CBP(1 to 771) fragment with HNF4 is AF-2 independent (21) (referred to as AF-2 AD in this reference).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This discrepancy is not due to the presence of the RID in the CBP(1 to 771) fragment since both our results and those of Yoshida et al.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	240	 (20) showed that the RID is dispensable for interaction of CBP/p300 with HNF4.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a slight difference of behavior between CBP and p300 despite their very close structures (23).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	242	Cooperation between HNF4 and other transcription factors or coactivators is crucial in HNF4-mediated transcriptional activation (16, 17, 18, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Some of these transcriptional partners interact directly with HNF4 (16, 17, 18, 44).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In addition to alteration in p300 recruitment by R154X and E276Q mutations, we have previously shown that alteration in synergy with the transcription factor COUP-TFII by the E276Q mutation strongly impairs HNF4 function (33).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Alteration in recruitments probably occurs with other HNF4 partners since the R154X and E276Q mutations also impair the in vitro interaction with the GRIP-1 (glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein-1) coactivator (J.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Eeckhoute, unpublished results).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Therefore, our results emphasize that impairment of recruitment of transcriptional partners by MODY1-associated HNF4 mutations most likely represents a key mechanism leading to HNF4 loss of function.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	248	The impairment of p300-mediated enhancement of HNF4 activity by MODY1 mutations has been observed on the HNF1 promoter.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	249	 HNF1 is essential for insulin gene transcription and also regulates expression of genes involved in glucose transport and metabolism and in insulin secretion (11).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In addition, loss of HNF1 function results in defective insulin secretion responses to glucose (10, 11), and mutations in the HNF1 gene are associated with another form of MODY, MODY3 (45).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Interestingly, patients with MODY1 and MODY3 exhibit similar clinical profiles (46).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Also, recent results showed that the phenotype and gene expression patterns of INS-1 ss-cells expressing a dominant negative HNF4 are strikingly similar to those of INS-1 ss-cells expressing a dominant negative HNF1 (6), which led the authors to suggest that loss of HNF4 function may cause abnormal ss-cell function secondary to defective HNF1 function.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Therefore, impairment by R154X and E276Q mutations in the p300 recruitment leading to a reduced activity of the HNF1 promoter is of major interest.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Nevertheless, as for other MODY1-associated HNF4 mutations, further studies are needed to link our mechanistic information to comprehension of ss-cell dysfunction and MODY1 physiopathology.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Indeed, whatever the mechanisms underlying HNF4 loss of function (either deletion of the AF-2 activation function for the Q268X and R154X mutations or impaired recruitment of HNF4 partners such as COUP-TF and p300 for the E276Q mutation), the scientific community is still unable to explain clearly how these HNF4 mutations lead to ss-cell abnormal function and to development of diabetes.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	256	 These mutations, as well as mutations in the HNF1 gene, are supposed to cause haploinsufficiency or reduced gene dosage (35, 47) since they do not result in proteins exhibiting dominant negative activities on the wild-type protein expressed from the unaffected allele [except for a slight dominant negative behavior of R154X in HIT-T15 cells (36)].
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Strikingly, although the Q268X exhibits a complete lack of transcriptional activity, its expression in ss-cells did not result in deficient insulin secretion (6).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Furthermore, the huge variability in the clinical characteristics of patients with MODY1 diabetes suggests the existence of other factors (environmental, genetic) influencing the phenotype of MODY1 patients (46).
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Advances in clinical studies and cell biology of Langerhans islets, together with functional studies of HNF4 mutants, are clearly required for a better understanding of the physiopathology of MODY1 diabetes.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The present work, exploring the mechanisms by which the mutations E276Q and R154X could affect the function of HNF4, represents one contribution to achieve this goal.
0.53388375.11435618.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This work also sheds new light on the crucial roles played by the glutamic acid residue at position 276 and by the AF-2 activation function module in recruitment of the p300 coactivator and therefore in the structure-function relationship of this nuclear receptor.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	4	Mutations in the HNF4 gene are associated with the subtype 1 of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1), which is characterized by impaired insulin secretory response to glucose in pancreatic -cells.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is a transcription factor critical for liver development and hepatocyte-specific gene expression.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, the role of HNF4 in the regulation of pancreatic -cell gene expression and its correlation with metabolism secretion coupling have not been previously investigated.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The tetracycline-inducible system was employed to achieve tightly controlled expression of both wild type (WT) and dominant-negative mutant (DN) of HNF4 in INS-1 cells.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The induction of WT-HNF4 resulted in a left shift in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas DN-HNF4 selectively impaired nutrient-stimulated insulin release.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Induction of DN-HNF4 also caused defective mitochondrial function substantiated by reduced [14C]pyruvate oxidation, attenuated substrate-evoked mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and blunted nutrient-generated cellular ATP production.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Quantitative evaluation of HNF4-regulated pancreatic -cell gene expression revealed altered mRNA levels of insulin, glucose transporter-2, L-pyruvate kinase, aldolase B, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E1 subunit, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The patterns of HNF4-regulated gene expression are strikingly similar to that of its downstream transcription factor HNF1.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Indeed, HNF4 changed the HNF1 mRNA levels and HNF1 promoter luciferase activity through altered HNF4 binding.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results demonstrate the importance of HNF4 in -cell metabolism-secretion coupling.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	14	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	15	The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4),1 a transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is expressed in liver, kidney, gut, and pancreatic islets (1-3).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mutations in the human HNF4 gene lead to maturity onset diabetes of the young subtype 1 (MODY1), which is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells (4-6).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These MODY1 mutations located in various domains of the HNF4 protein result in defective function of the transcription factor (6).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The clinical phenotype of MODY1 patients is indistinguishable from that of MODY3 patients who carry mutations in the HNF1 gene (5, 6).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	19	 HNF4 acts upstream of HNF1 in a transcriptional cascade that drives liver-specific gene expression and hepatocyte differentiation (7-9).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	20	 A naturally occurring mutation in the HNF4-binding site of the HNF1 promoter identified in a MODY3 family (10) suggests that the transcriptional hierarchy could also be involved in pancreatic -cell gene expression and function.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	21	HNF4 defines the expression of liver-specific genes encoding apolipoproteins, serum factors, cytochrome P-450 isoforms, and proteins involved in the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids (reviewed in Ref.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, clinical characterization of MODY1 subjects reveals that the primary defect is impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells rather than liver dysfunction (5, 12-14).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Unfortunately, little is known as to how HNF4 regulates -cell-restricted gene expression and glucose metabolism and associated insulin secretion.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Targeted disruption of the hnf4 gene results in defective gastrulation of mouse embryos due to dysfunction of the visceral endoderm (15).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This early embryonic lethality prevents further analysis of the HNF4 function in pancreatic -cells.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The precise role of HNF4 in pancreatic -cells would best be examined by conditional -cell-specific deletion of the mouse hnf4 gene.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Another alternative is to up- and down-regulate HNF4 function in pancreatic -cell lines through gene manipulation.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	28	In the present study, the wild type HNF4 (WT-HNF4) and its dominant-negative mutant (DN-HNF4) could be induced in INS-1 cells under tight control of the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (16).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	29	 DN-HNF4 represents the epitope Myc-tagged truncated HNF4 mutant protein lacking the first 111 amino acids (myc111HNF4) (17).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The HNF4 protein consists of an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (amino acids 1-24), a DNA binding domain containing two zinc fingers (amino acids 51-117), and a large hydrophobic portion (amino acids 163-368) composed of the dimerization, ligand binding, cofactor binding, and ligand-dependent transactivation domain (18, 19).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	31	 DN-HNF4 therefore suppresses the endogenous WT-HNF4 transcriptional activity by the formation of heterodimers lacking DNA binding capacity (17).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We have investigated in a quantitative manner the consequences of altered HNF4 function on -cell-specific expression of genes implicated in glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This allowed us to elucidate the molecular basis and HNF4 target genes responsible for impaired metabolism secretion coupling in -cells deficient in HNF4 function.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, graded overexpression of WT-HNF4 could be achieved by culturing the WT-HNF4-28 cells with varying doses of doxycycline in a defined period.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	118	 This could be explained by defective glucose and leucine metabolism.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	135	To test this hypothesis, we examined the consequences of DN-HNF4 induction on mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Pyruvate-derived carbons enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle as either acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, or oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	137	 By using pyruvate radiolabeled at either the first or second carbon, the putative defects at various steps in pyruvate metabolism can be assessed.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The radiolabeled carbon of [1-14C]pyruvate is lost to CO2 at the pyruvate dehydrogenase step as pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Alternatively, if pyruvate enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle via oxaloacetate, the label is lost to CO2 at isocitrate dehydrogenase within one turn of the cycle.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Radiolabeled CO2 is generated from 2-14C at either OGDH or isocitrate dehydrogenase when pyruvate enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle as acetyl-CoA.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These results suggest that the defect in mitochondrial metabolism is not at the point of entry of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, rather that the defect appears in reactions within the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	144	 This is in full agreement with the impairment of leucine stimulation of insulin secretion since leucine metabolism bypasses pyruvate and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle solely as acetyl-CoA.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Decreased isocitrate dehydrogenase activity would also be unlikely since impairment at this step would be observed by both [1-14C]pyruvate and [2-14C]pyruvate oxidation.

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	209	 To confirm that HNF4 directly regulates HNF1 transcription, we transiently transfected WT-HNF4-28 and DN-HNF4-26 cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing either the wild type HNF1 gene promoter (HNF1Luc) or a promoter that lacks a functional HNF4-binding site (AHNF1Luc).

0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	216	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	217	It has been demonstrated that HNF4 controls the expression of a large array of liver-specific genes encoding several apolipoproteins, metabolic proteins, and serum factors that are essential for hepatocyte differentiation and liver development (9).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	218	 HNF4 is also required for HNF1 expression in hepatocytes (7-9).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Another study in embryonic stem cell-differentiated embryoid bodies (33) shows that the absence of HNF4 affects the expression of genes encoding GLUT-2, aldolase B, and L-PK, which are involved in glucose transport and glycolysis.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	220	 However, little is known as to how HNF4 regulates pancreatic -cell gene expression.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The primary cause of the MODY1 phenotype is impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells (5).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The present study was therefore designed to investigate the role of HNF4 in the regulation of the expression of -cell genes implicated in glucose metabolism and associated insulin secretion.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	223	We found that overexpression of WT-HNF4 caused a left shift of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas dominant-negative suppression of HNF4 selectively blunted the insulin release induced by glucose and leucine but not by K+ depolarization.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The diminished nutrient-evoked insulin secretion is associated with reduced ATP production in DN-HNF4-expressing cells.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The physiological insulin secretagogue leucine raises the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations through mitochondrial metabolism downstream of glycolysis (28, 34).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Therefore, we suggest that loss of HNF4 function leads to defective mitochondrial metabolism and, as a consequence, impaired insulin secretion.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The reduced mitochondrial oxidation of [2-14C]pyruvate and the abrogation of mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization elicited by glucose, pyruvate, and methyl succinate indicate impaired mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activity and partial uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	228	Quantitative Northern blot analysis allows us to identify HNF4 target genes responsible for defective metabolism-secretion coupling.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	229	 HNF4 indeed regulates the expression of genes encoding GLUT-2, aldolase B, and L-PK in pancreatic -cells (Fig.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	230	 5), as inferred from previous studies in hepatocytes and embryonic stem cell-differentiated embryoid bodies (8, 9).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Most importantly, we demonstrate that HNF4 alters the mRNA expression of mitochondrial OGDH E1 subunit and UCP-2 (Fig.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	232	 5), which may indeed contribute more significantly to the impaired metabolism-secretion coupling.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The phenotype and gene expression patterns in DN-HNF4-expressing cells are strikingly similar to those of DN-HNF1-expressing cells (22, 29).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	234	 This prompted us to investigate whether HNF4 regulates -cell expression through HNF1 function, as in hepatocytes (9).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	235	 We provide unprecedented evidence that HNF4 is required for HNF1 expression in pancreatic -cells.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	236	This conclusion is based on the use of an artificial dominant-negative hnf4 mutation.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The naturally occurring human mutations of HNF4 do not function in a dominant-negative manner (6, 35).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	238	 It is to be expected that a mutation with such repressive action on the endogenous HNF4 function would cause embryonic lethality, as is the case in the hnf4 knock-out mouse (15).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Haploinsufficiency or reduced gene dosage of HNF4 may thus explain the mechanism leading to the MODY1 phenotype (33).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The INS-1 cell line expressing DN-HNF4 provides a convenient model to explore the impact of impaired HNF4 function on -cell gene expression and metabolism-secretion coupling.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This goal cannot be achieved by the introduction of one of the human HNF4 mutations into -cell lines.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	242	 In fact, the induction of a nonsense mutation HNF4Q268X to a level similar to DN-HNF4 had no detectable consequences on -cell gene expression and metabolism-secretion coupling.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	243	MODY1 patients display secretory defects not only in -cells but also in the glucagon-secreting -cells and the pancreatic polypeptide-secreting cells (36, 37).
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, this general effect on islet hormone release does not seem due to an effect on the development and differentiation of the endocrine pancreas, since altered HNF4 function did not affect the expression of PDX1 and other transcription factors determining pancreatic phenotype.
0.278518.10967120.html.plaintext.txt	245	 On the other hand, loss of HNF4 function may cause reduced -cell insulin content secondary to defective HNF1 function (22, 29).

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	4	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional cytokine that controls the growth and differentiation of various tissues.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Previously, we described the existence of a negative cis-acting regulatory element(s) within the 1- to 0.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	6	7-kilobase pair (kb) portion of the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In the present study, we show that the repressor element is located at position 872 to 860 base pairs and comprises an imperfect estrogen-responsive element 5-AGGTCAGAAAGACCA-3.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We demonstrate that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), a nuclear orphan receptor belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, through binding to this site effectively silences the transcriptional activity of the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We show that estrogen receptor, on the other hand, relieves the repressive action of COUP-TF, resulting in the induction of the HGF promoter.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Potential involvement of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors in the regulation of HGF gene expression is also discussed.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	14	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 was originally identified as the major mitogenic component of serum and platelets for normal adult rat hepatocytes (1, 2).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Further investigations revealed that HGF is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad range of target cells (3, 4).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	16	 HGF elicits its biological effects through binding to and activating a specific transmembrane tyrosine kinase (4-6) known as Met (HGF receptor) (7).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	17	 HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and is restricted to stromal cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in various tissues.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Numerous studies have shown that this growth factor is involved in the growth and regeneration of several organs (8-10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In response to tissue loss, such as in the case of partial hepatectomy or hepatotoxin injury, the level of HGF mRNA dramatically increases in the liver as well as in other organs such as the lung and spleen (9, 10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	20	 HGF mRNA also increases in the remaining kidney or lung after unilateral nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively (9, 10).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Recent investigations in transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation in the HGF gene (knock-out mice) have proved that HGF is essential for the development of various tissues such as liver, muscle, and placenta (11, 12).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	22	HGF expression is modulated by several cytokines and hormones.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	23	 For example, it has been shown that in MRC-5 fibroblasts and HL-60 cells HGF expression is down-regulated by transforming growth factor 1 and dexamethasone or by coculture with epithelial cells (13-15).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In contrast, phorbol esters, interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis factor  increase HGF mRNA level (16-19).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Overexpression of HGF mRNA in various neoplastic tissues has also been reported.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To understand the transcriptional regulation of HGF, the sequences of the human, rat, and mouse HGF gene promoters have been determined and the major transcriptional start sites have been mapped (20-23).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Several potential regulatory sites including NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBP) were identified in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter by our laboratory (22) as well as by others (20-24).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We reported the identification and partial characterization of a transcriptional repressor in the promoter of the mouse HGF gene (25).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We also localized a negative regulatory region in the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter residing at position 1 to 0.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In the current study, we show that COUP-TF binds to an imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) in this region and represses HGF promoter activity.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We show that high expression of the estrogen receptor counteracts the suppressive action of COUP-TF by competing for the same binding site.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	32	COUP-TF, which belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family, was originally found through its interaction with a response element in the chicken ovalbumin gene promoter (26, 27) and has been shown to play both positive and negative roles in gene regulation upon binding to its cognate DNA regulatory element (28).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The COUP-TF family (which consists of COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II) binds to the AGGTCA repeat sequence, which also is the DNA half-site for several other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER), vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptors (RAR and RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) (28-31).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In previous studies we reported that estrogen stimulates HGF mRNA expression in mouse ovaries (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Our current results implicate COUP-TF as a potent repressor of HGF gene transcription and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate HGF gene expression.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	207	We previously showed that injection of estradiol into mice dramatically stimulated HGF mRNA expression in mouse ovary (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Our present data reveal that the molecular mechanism by which estradiol stimulates the HGF promoter is through the counteraction by ER of COUP-TF, which directly down-regulates the mouse HGF promoter.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	225	Our previous studies have shown that a negative regulatory element is located within 964 to 699 of the 5-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene (22).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In this region, an estrogen response element (HERE1) was identified that binds to ER and is responsible for the estradiol stimulation of the mouse HGF promoter in RL95-2 cells co-transfected with an ER expression vector (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	227	 We now show that this same element binds with high affinity to the nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TF, which belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and silences the activity of the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	228	 We demonstrate that the estrogen receptor competes with COUP-TF for binding to this site, thereby relieving the repressive action of COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	229	There are two imperfect EREs found in the mouse HGF promoter region that we have called HERE1 and HERE2 (22, 32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	230	 HERE1 is localized in the 5-flanking region and HERE2 is in the first intron of the HGF gene.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	231	 By using gel mobility band shift and supershift assays, we demonstrated that HERE1 is similar to the ERE found in the vitellogenin (vit) gene (37) and that it binds not only to ER but also to COUP-TF (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Co-transfection of ER or COUP-TF expression vectors in NIH3T3 cells revealed that HERE1 confers the repressive function of COUP-TF to the heterologous SV40 promoter and that not only did ER overcome the suppression of COUP-TF but it also stimulated the SV40 promoter (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	233	 In the homologous mouse HGF promoter, ER only counteracted the negative effects of COUP-TF (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	234	The molecular mechanisms of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression are partially understood.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	235	 COUP-TF acts via several different mechanisms to inhibit target gene transcription including competition with other nuclear receptors for the occupancy of DNA binding sites, active repression of basal transcription, active repression of transactivator-dependent transcription, quenching of transactivator-dependent transcription, transrepression of activated transcription, and titration of the common coregulator RXR (31, 38).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Our data shown here reveal that COUP-TF may down-regulate the mouse HGF promoter by active repression of basal transcription because HERE1 suppresses the basal SV40 promoter and that ER may activate HGF transcriptional activity by replacing COUP-TF and relieving the promoter from repression (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	237	 COUP-TF belongs to the orphan (thus far, no ligand has been found that can bind and directly regulate the activity of this factor) nuclear receptor family and resembles the thyroid hormone receptor/steroid hormone receptor superfamily (31, 36).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The mode by which it represses its target gene involves the binding of COUP-TF to the AGGTCA motif arranged in various configurations (i.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	239	 direct repeats (DR) or inverted repeats (IR) with different numbers of spacers ranging from 0 to 8 nucleotides) (31).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Interestingly, the AGGTCA half-site depending on its configuration forms the response elements for other nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (which binds to IR3), thyroid hormone receptor (which binds to IR0 or DR4), retinoid receptors (RAR, which binds to IR0 and DR2, and RXR, which binds to DR5 and DR1), vitamin D receptor (which binds to DR3), HNF4, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (31).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	241	 It is believed that COUP-TF directly competes with these receptors for binding to the AGGTCA sequence and thus inhibits their transactivating functions.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Suppression by COUP-TF is also achieved in part through heterodimerization of COUP-TF with RXR (which is the essential transactivating partner for vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and RAR), thereby titrating RXR to a transcriptionally inactive complex (31, 38).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	243	 It is tempting to speculate that in addition to ER other members of the nuclear receptor family mentioned above may bind to the COUP-TF binding site in the HGF promoter HERE1 and thus activate HGF transcription in a tissue-specific manner.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The COUP-TF site in the HGF promoter, however, is composed of an estrogen response element (IR3) and apparently binds only to the estrogen receptor.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	245	Previous observations in our laboratory showed that administration of 17-estradiol to immature female mice caused a significant induction of HGF mRNA in the ovaries (32).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The tissue- and cell type-specific expression of the mouse HGF gene by estrogen may be due to different amounts of hormone receptors in these tissues, as shown by other studies (37).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Our present studies show that high expression of estrogen receptor in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to counteract the suppression of COUP-TF on the mouse HGF promoter (Fig.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	248	 HGF promoter activity or lack thereof in transgenic mice also supports this hypothesis because estradiol stimulated the HGF promoter in mice carrying the 2.

0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In this regard, it is important to understand how HGF gene expression is relieved from COUP-TF repression in other tissues in which ER may not be operational.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The factors that are known to activate HGF expression include cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor  and polypeptide growth factors such as epidermal growth factor.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	252	 These agents do not exert their gene-regulatory function directly through the AGGTCA motif, the DNA binding site for COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Although the molecular mechanisms by which these agents induce their target genes are not fully understood, it is well established that they utilize members of the AP1, C/EBP, nuclear factor B (NFKB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Indeed, in our previous report (22) we demonstrated that several NF-IL6 (C/EBP) response elements exist in the 5-flanking region of the HGF promoter region and that IL-6 induces HGF promoter activity in a stromal (fibroblast) cell line stably transfected with an HGF-CAT chimeric construct.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In our very recent investigations using gel shift, supershift, and CAT assays, we have found that functional C/EBP binding sites exist in the HGF promoter.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	256	 We also found that co-transfection of expression vectors encoding C/EBP or C/EBP with HGF-CAT vectors dramatically (more than 20-fold) stimulates the transcriptional activity of various HGF-CAT promoter constructs (even those constructs that do not contain COUP-TF binding sites, thus indicating that promoter activation is not due to interference with COUP-TF binding).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	257	3 These observations provide an explanation for how the HGF promoter is released from repression exerted by negative acting factors such as COUP-TF.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	258	 The C/EBP family of transcription factors is known to consist of regulators of important cellular functions ranging from metabolism to cell growth to differentiation.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	259	The physiological significance of the transcriptional regulation of the HGF gene by ER and COUP-TF also remains to be elucidated.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Nevertheless, it has been shown that both HGF and COUP-TF play an important role during embryonic development.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	261	 COUP-TFs are differentially expressed in a restricted manner during organogenesis (40).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Both COUP-TF I and COUP-TF II genes are essential since COUP-TF I mutants die prenatally and COUP-TF II mutants die in utero (41).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Additionally, HGF is believed to be one of the major mediators of stromal-epithelial interactions controlling growth and morphogenesis of various tissues such as breast (39).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Studies on the embryological development of such tissues have revealed that steroid hormone-induced ductal morphogenesis and growth is accomplished via the interactions between the stromal and epithelial compartments of these tissues (34).
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Therefore, the functions of COUP-TF and ER during development may be mediated in part by their ability to regulate HGF gene expression.
0.43641222.9020096.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Our data shown here shed light on the significant interplay among transcription factors such as ER, COUP-TF, and C/EBP and polypeptide growth factors such as HGF.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates genes that play a critical role in embryogenesis and metabolism.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Recent studies have shown that mutations in the human HNF4 gene cause a rare form of type 2 diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To investigate the properties of these naturally occurring HNF4 mutations we analysed five MODY1 mutations (R154X, R127W, V255M, Q268X and E276Q) and one other mutation (D69A), which we found in HepG2 hepatoma cells.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Activation of reporter genes in transfection assays and DNA binding studies showed that the MODY1-associated mutations result in a variable reduction in function, whereas the D69A mutation showed an increased activity on some promoters.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	7	 None of the MODY mutants acted in a dominant negative manner, thus excluding inactivation of the wild-type factor as a critical event in MODY development.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	8	 A MODY3-associated mutation in the HNF1 gene, a well-known target gene of HNF4, results in a dramatic loss of the HNF4 binding site in the promoter, indicating that mutations in the HNF4 gene might cause MODY through impaired HNF1 gene function.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Based on these data we propose a two-hit model for MODY development.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In vertebrates the tissue-specific transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4 is expressed in liver, kidney, gut and endocrine pancreas (1,2).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	11	 HNF4 as a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily is designated NR2A1 (3) and belongs to the 2A subfamily together with HNF4ss (4) and HNF4 (5) as its closest related genes in Xenopus and mammals, respectively.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	12	 HNF4 was initially described as an orphan receptor lacking an identified ligand, but recently fatty acyl-CoA thioesters have been proposed as ligands (6).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The DNA-binding domain of HNF4 consists of two zinc finger motifs that specifically interact with a DNA element found in many promoters and enhancers of target genes.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These target genes encode serum proteins as well as enzymes involved in lipid, amino acid and glucose metabolism, but also the tissue-specific transcription factor HNF1 (1).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Based on the HNF4 binding site in the HNF1 promoter, a regulatory hierarchy has been proposed with HNF4 playing a superior role (7).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, as the HNF4 promoter contains an HNF1 binding site, a reverse regulatory cascade may also be possible (8).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The gene regulatory potential of HNF4 has been clearly documented in transfection experiments where the forced expression of HNF4 activates several endogenous genes, but the extent of activation is determined by the type of recipient cell used (7,9 to 11).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	18	HNF4 also plays an important role in the early phases of embryogenesis since it is present as a maternal component in the egg of the amphibian species Xenopus (12) as well as in Drosophila (13).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In the mouse, embryonic expression of HNF4 can already be observed in the primary endoderm at day 4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, in undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells, the HNF4 gene is expressed by apparently using an alternative promoter (15).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The essential early function of HNF4 in mammals is proven by the fact that disruption of the murine HNF4 gene leads to embryonic lethality due to a dysfunction of the visceral endoderm (16,17).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	22	Lack of HNF4 expression is a typical feature of human renal cell carcinoma (18), but so far no tumour-associated mutations have been found (our unpublished data).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In contrast, mutations in the human HNF4 gene cause maturity onset diabetes in the young (MODY1), a rare form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (19).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, affects people usually under the age of 25 years and is characterised by defective secretion of insulin by the ss-cells of the pancreas (reviewed in 20).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The mutants described so far include two nonsense mutations, R154X (21) and Q268X (19), and two frameshift mutations, F75delT (22) and K99fsdelAA (23), which all result in truncated HNF4 proteins.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, five missense mutations have been identified, G115S, R127W (24,25), V255M (26), E276Q (27) and V393I (28), that affect various domains of the HNF4 protein.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	27	 As HNF4 is not only expressed in the ss-cells (1), mutated HNF4 proteins are expected to have pleiotropic phenotypes.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, no additional severe clinical phenotypes have been reported in mutant carriers, except secondary complications associated with diabetes itself.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Recently, a MODY1-associated decrease in triglyceride concentration was observed in diabetic patients that is considered to be an effect of impaired expression of hepatic apoCIII and apoB (23).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	30	 MODY3, with identical clinical features to MODY1 patients, is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the tissue-specific transcription factor HNF1 (reviewed in 20).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This fact supports the hypothesis that HNF4 and HNF1 cooperate in a network of transcription factors (2) and is strengthened by the finding of a MODY3 mutation in the HNF4 binding site of the HNF1 promoter (29).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	32	In the present work we have analysed the functional activity of several MODY-associated HNF4 mutations as well as a novel mutation found in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	70	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Mutation in the HNF4 gene of the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 In a search for mutations in the HNF4 gene in various tumour cell lines of human origin we observed altered migration of the PCR-amplified fragment of exon 2 upon denaturing gel electro phoresis.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Direct sequencing of this PCR product revealed an A as well as a C residue at a position 206 bp downstream of the translation start site in the coding strand of the HepG2 DNA, whereas only the nucleotide A was found in the SK-RC-8 cell line that was used as a control.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Thus codon 69 encodes the usual aspartic acid (GAC = D) as well as the amino acid alanine (GCC = A).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The heterozygosity at codon 69 was initially found in a HepG2 cell line maintained in our laboratory for several years, but was also present in a HepG2 sample obtained from CLS (passage 30; Cell Line Services, Heidelberg, Germany) as well as the HepG2 variant C3A obtained from the ATTC (CRL-10741; American Tissue Type Collection, Manassas, USA).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, we conclude that the heterozygous D69A mutation is a feature specific for the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	75	The mutation D69A changes an amino acid in the P-box (CDGCKG) of the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain (Fig.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	85	A MODY3-associated mutation destroys the HNF4 binding site in the HNF1 promoter The concept that HNF4 and HNF1 act together in the same pathways is strengthened by the fact that HNF1 represents the MODY3 gene.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In MODY3 patients mutations have not only been found in the open reading frame of the HNF1 gene, but also at nucleotide  to 58 of the promoter region (29).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This region is highly conserved between Xenopus and mammals and corresponds to a HNF4 binding site (37).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	88	 To analyse the effect of this mutation we prepared a HNF1 promoter to luciferase reporter gene containing the sequence from  to 325 to +138 of the human HNF1 gene as well as a corresponding construct containing the MODY3 mutation (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In transfection experiments using HeLa cells that lack endogeneous HNF4 proteins, the wild-type HNF1 promoter-driven luciferase activity was stimulated up to 35-fold with increasing amounts of an expression vector encoding HNF4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In contrast, the reporter containing the MODY3 mutation was stimulated by, at most, 4-fold with addition of the HNF4 expression vector (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This demonstrates that the single nucleotide change at  to 58 leads to a dramatic loss in the activation potential of the HNF1 promoter by HNF4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To analyse whether this effect mainly represented the loss of binding of HNF4 to this site we performed bandshift assays using the corresponding labelled oligonucleotide and rat liver nuclear extracts.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Figure 2C demonstrates a DNA to protein complex up-shifted with an antibody specific for HNF4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	94	 This complex was competed out efficiently by adding increasing amounts of the unlabelled oligonucleotide, whereas the addition of an unlabelled competitor representing the mutated HNF4 binding site had no effect.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	95	 From the input of the oligonucleotides as competitors, we estimate that the MODY3 mutation in the HNF4 binding site reduces the binding affinity of HNF4 by at least a factor of 30.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Based on this finding the HNF1 promoter is a valuable reporter to analyse the function of HNF4 derivatives within a natural promoter context.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The data given in Figure 3 show that the missense mutant R127W retains ~50% of wild-type activity whereas the three missense mutants, V255M, E276Q and D69A, are as active as the wild-type.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In contrast, both nonsense mutants, R154X and Q268X, have completely lost their transactivation potential.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	114	 To look for more subtle changes in the activity of the mutated HNF4 proteins we performed saturation curves with the missense mutants using increasing concentrations of the corresponding expression vectors and compared them to the wild-type.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Figure 4A shows that the R127W mutant was less active at all concentrations tested, whereas the V255M and E276Q mutants gave decreased transactivation values only at low expression vector input.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	116	 However, the performance of the D69A mutant was identical to the wild-type protein.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	117	 The experiments shown in Figure 4A were performed with the luciferase reporter containing the human HNF1 promoter, but identical results were obtained using the reporter containing four HNF4 binding sites linked to the thymidine kinase promoter.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	146	 To investigate the DNA binding properties of the mutants we prepared extracts from 293 cells transfected with the corresponding expression vector.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In western blots using an antibody specific for the myc tag we could detect the R154X mutant protein in the nuclear salt extract and the insoluble pellet, as for all the other mutants.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Therefore, in band shift assays no binding to an oligonucleotide containing an HNF4 binding site was detected with nuclear salt extracts for the Q268X mutant.

0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Wild-type HNF4 was found in 95 to 98% in the nuclear compartment and the same distribution was found for all the missense mutants (data not shown).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	162	 On the other hand the myc tag antibody rarely detected any signal derived from the transfected nonsense mutants R154X and Q268X in HeLa cells (data not shown).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	163	 As both truncated proteins can be detected in western blots derived from transfected cells, we assume that the myc tag is not accessible for immunohistochemistry by the antibody in both these constructs.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	164	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   By screening the HNF4 gene in human carcinoma cell lines we identified the D69A mutation of the HepG2 hepatoma cell line.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	165	 As this mutation affects an allele that is expressed in the cell line and increases the transactivation potential of the HNF4 protein on some promoters, this finding is most relevant, as HepG2 cells are one of the most frequently used human models for hepatic cell function.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The HepG2 cell line was established in 1980 (41).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Our efforts to identify whether the mutation was already in the germline or occurred either during tumour development or during establishment of the cell line were unsuccessful due to a lack of appropriate material.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	168	 However, this mutation has not been observed in any MODY patient to date and we did not identify any other mutation in the HNF4 gene in other human hepatoma cells analysed (unpublished data in collaboration with D.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The D69A mutation alters an amino acid in the P-box of the first zinc finger.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	170	 As this residue is conserved in all HNF4 proteins from insects to mammals (1), we would assume that it plays a crucial role.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our transfection experiments showed that it has an increased activity on some promoters.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, the effect is quite small and one may wonder why this residue has been conserved throughout evolution.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	173	We also investigated the functional consequence of a mutation in the HNF4 binding site of the promoter of the HNF1 gene that was identified in a MODY3 family (29).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	174	 By gel retardation assays we could show that the mutated HNF4 binding site has an at least 30-fold lower affinity for HNF4 compared to the wild-type binding site.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Consistent with this dramatically reduced binding, in transfection experiments we observed that the mutated promoter can hardly be stimulated by HNF4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	176	 This finding establishes that the MODY3 mutation generating a mutated HNF4 binding site largely destroys the ability for transactivation by HNF4 and thus represents a loss of function mutation of the HNF1 gene.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	177	 It gives further evidence that HNF4 and HNF1 cooperate in ss-cells of the pancreas and thus both genes constitute a sensitive target for the development of diabetes.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Furthermore, the result indicates that the HNF1 promoter is a relevant reporter to assay the function of HNF4 mutants in transfection experiments.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The importance of the HNF4 binding site in the HNF1 promoter has been shown in transgenic Xenopus, as a mutated HNF4 binding site of the Xenopus HNF1 promoter precludes expression of the HNF1 promoter transgenes in the pronephros (42).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	180	Our functional analysis of mutated HNF4 proteins that occur in MODY patients reveals a broad range of effects on the performance of this transcription factor.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The two nonsense mutants R154X and Q268X lack any transactivation potential and do not interfere with the activity of the wild-type factor.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This conclusion had previously been made in a report investigating Q268X function (40,43).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	183	 As Q268X has the potential to heterodimerise with the wild-type HNF4 protein in vitro, it has been proposed that the inability of the mutant to affect the activity of the wild-type in vivo may be due to an altered subcellular localisation of the mutant compared to the wild-type.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The truncated proteins derived from Q268X and R154X both retain the DNA-binding domain, but only R154X binds DNA in a gel retardation assay (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This finding is in agreement with a systematic deletion analysis of the various domains of HNF4 (44): in the absence of the C-terminal sequence (amino acids 340 to 465) the sequences located carboxyl to residue 174 inhibit DNA binding of these truncated HNF4 variants.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	186	 According to this result the DNA binding activity observed for the R154X mutant is expected.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	187	In contrast to the nonsense mutants, the three missense mutants also associated with diabetes retain substantial transactivation potential (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	188	 In fact, at saturation the mutants V255M and E276Q gave identical transactivation compared to the wild-type and only differed by a decreased activity at low expression vector input.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Under the same experimental conditions the mutant R127W gave a 2- to 3-fold lower transactivation at all concentrations tested.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	190	 After completion of our work a functional analysis of the same three missense mutants has been published (45).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The lack of any functional defect in the R127W and V255M mutants in this report may have been overlooked by the use of a single concentration of expression vector in the transfection assay.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	192	 More significantly, these authors found no transactivation for the E276Q mutant.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	193	 This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that they introduced the mutation into the HNF4 protein of the rat, since the human protein carrying the same mutation was found to be active by another group (46), in agreement with our finding.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In fact, these authors (46) have established that a major effect of the E276Q mutant involves an impaired synergy of the mutated factor with the chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor II (COUP TFII).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	195	 A fourth MODY missense mutant of HNF4, V393I, has been shown to have a 2-fold reduced transactivation activity (28).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus all missense mutants associated with diabetes have a reduced transactivation potential, whereas the missense mutant we found in HepG2 cells has an increased activity on at least some promoters (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	197	Taken together these functional data on the various HNF4 mutants associated with diabetes show a very broad effect on the activity of the transcription factor.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The only consistent feature that can be observed is a loss of function.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Mixing a transcription factor with reduced transactivation potential with the wild-type factor yields an intermediate activity if assayed at saturation but an additive value at sub-saturating conditions (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Such a behaviour is expected for a transcription factor acting as a dimer.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Surprisingly, none of the naturally occurring mutants analysed exhibited a clear dominant negative effect (Fig.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	202	 5B) that would involve inactivation of the wild-type factor, although such a mechanism seems quite probable for a transcription factor acting as a dimer.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Since different artificial mutants of HNF4 have been generated in several laboratories that act as dominant negative factors on the wild-type factor (43,47 to 49), we speculate that such mutations are not compatible with human development, as they would inactivate essential functions of the wild-type factor.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This assumption is strengthened by the fact that knockout mice die at early embryonic stages prior to gastrulation (16).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	205	 However, it is quite puzzling that a loss of function mutation of one allele in the presence of a wild-type allele leads to the development of a disease.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Assuming a gene dosage effect one would expect clinical differences between the nonsense mutations that destroy the gene, e.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	207	 R154X and Q268X, and the missense mutations that hardly affect the function of HNF4.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Such differences are not apparent, but could be hidden by the individual differences between the various patients.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	209	 As MODY1 patients are not born with diabetes and initially have no measurable abnormal function in the ss-cells of the pancreas, it seem unlikely that the mutated HNF4 is deficient in a specific function such as interaction with COUP-TF (46).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It is more probable that additional events occur with time.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Therefore, we speculate that the function of the wild-type allele is occasionally lost in ss-cells, involving either a somatic mutation or some epigenetic event.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	212	 We imagine that this loss of function of the wild-type allele leads to some selective advantage, thus allowing overgrowth of the original ss-cell population.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Such a scenario is reminiscent of the development of tumours in inherited cancer syndromes where one tumour suppressor allele is mutated in the germline and inactivation of the wild-type allele is a major step in tumour formation (50,51).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Such a two-hit model also seems to occur in non-malignant diseases, most notably in inherited human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which is characterised by loss of or a mutation in the normal allele (52,53).
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Clearly, such a speculation on the mechanism of MODY development has to be verified by more direct approaches.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	216	 It would be crucial to show that expression of the wild-type HNF4 gene in ss-cells of MODY patient is gradually lost.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	217	 However, such an analysis cannot be readily performed in the human system.
0.38261595.10606640.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Furthermore, one should identify HNF4-dependent processes that maintain the balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis within the pancreatic ss-cell population.

0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	3	Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs), orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, play a key role in the regulation of organogenesis, neurogenesis, and cellular differentiation during embryogenic development.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	4	 COUP-TFs are also involved in the regulation of several genes that encode metabolic enzymes.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although COUP-TFs function as potent transcription repressors, there are at least three different molecular mechanisms of activation of gene expression by COUP-TFs.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	6	 First, as we have previously shown, COUP-TF is required as an accessory factor for the complete induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription by glucocorticoids.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This action is mediated by the binding of COUP-TF to the glucocorticoid accessory factor 1 (gAF1) and 3 (gAF3) elements in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene glucocorticoid response unit.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, COUP-TF1 binds to DNA elements in certain genes and transactivates directly.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, COUP-TF1 serves as a coactivator through DNA-bound hepatic nuclear factor 4.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Here we show that the same region of COUP-TFI, located between amino acids 184 and 423, is involved in these three mechanisms of transactivation by COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Furthermore, we show that GRIP1 and SRC-1 potentiate the activity of COUP-TFI and that COUP-TFI associates with these coactivators in vivo using the same region required for transcription activation.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Finally, overexpression of GRIP1 or SRC-1 does not convert COUP-TFI from a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator in HeLa cells.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	14	The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily is composed of many diverse subsets of transcriptional factors, including receptors for steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormones.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Also included are a large number of structurally and functionally related transcription regulatory proteins termed orphan receptors, so named because their natural ligands have not been identified (1-3).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF)1 is one of the most studied of the orphan receptors.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	17	 COUP-TFI (also termed EAR3) and COUP-TFII (also termed ARP-1) are closely related transcription factors that are expressed ubiquitously and are involved in the regulation of several important biological processes, such as neurogenesis, organogenesis, cell fate determination, and metabolic homeostasis (4-6).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Targeted disruptions of mouse COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII result in perinatal and embryonic lethality, respectively (7, 8).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	19	 COUP-TFs are also involved in the regulation of the transcription of genes that encode various metabolic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	20	32), cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7A; EC 1.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	21	17) (9), and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (EC 4.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	22	COUP-TFs homodimerize or heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor and a few other nuclear receptors and bind to a wide variety of response elements that contain imperfect AGGTCA direct repeats separated by a variable number of nucleotides (7, 11).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Although COUP-TF was initially identified as an activator of the chicken ovalbumin gene, COUP-TFs generally serve as negative regulators in conjunction with other nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoic acid receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) (11-13).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Several mechanisms account for the repressive effects of COUP-TFs.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	25	 COUP-TFs bind to a number of nuclear hormone receptor response elements and, thus, compete with receptors for these DNA elements.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	26	 COUP-TFs may also repress transcription by forming nonproductive complexes with retinoid X receptor, the essential heterodimer partner of a number of nuclear hormone receptors.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, at least two direct mechanisms of repression have been described.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In one example, termed active repression, COUP-TFs bind to specific DNA elements and repress by forming a direct interaction with corepressors such as nuclear receptor corepressor and silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) (14).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Finally, COUP-TFs can repress transcription by directly binding to the ligand binding domain of nuclear hormone receptors, a process called transrepression (13, 15).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	30	COUP-TFs also activate transcription in various promoter contexts (9, 10, 16-21).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	31	 COUP-TFII stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rat CYP7A promoter by binding to the nucleotide sequence located between 74 and 54 (relative to the transcription start site), which contains a direct repeat of two hormone response element half-sites separated by 4 nucleotides (a DR4) (9).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, COUP-TFs function as accessory factors for the hormonal response of some genes, such as the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK and the estrogen response of the trout estrogen receptor gene (19).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Finally, COUP-TFs also can function as coactivators.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	34	 For instance, COUP-TFs potentiate HNF-4-mediated transactivation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) gene promoter through direct interaction with HNF-4 and without a requirement for DNA binding (17).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A similar coactivator function has been described in the vHNF (also termed HNF-1-) gene promoter, where COUP-TFs do not bind DNA directly but potentiate the transcriptional activity of the vHNF gene promoter through a DNA-independent interaction with Oct-1 (20).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	36	Our interest is directed to the role COUP-TF plays in the hormonal regulation of the PEPCK gene.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	37	 PEPCK catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, a rate-controlling step in hepatic gluconeogenesis.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	38	 PEPCK gene transcription is positively regulated by glucocorticoids, glucagon (cAMP) and retinoic acid, whereas insulin inhibits the transcription of the PEPCK gene (22-24).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Induction of transcription of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids is achieved through a complex glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) (see Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The GRU includes, as a linear array from 5' to 3', two glucocorticoid accessory factor binding sites, gAF1 and gAF2,2 two glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites, GR1 and GR2, and a third accessory factor binding site, gAF3 (25, 26).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	41	 An intact cAMP response element (located between 93 and 86) is also required for a full glucocorticoid response and, thus, is part of the GRU (see Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The proteins that mediate the accessory activities through gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 have been identified.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Both HNF-4 and COUP-TF bind the gAF1 element and act as accessory factors for the glucocorticoid response (27).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A number of factors bind to gAF2, although only binding of hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3) specifically correlates with the ability of the gAF2 element to induce the glucocorticoid response (28).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	45	 COUP-TF also binds to gAF3 and acts as the accessory factor through this element (26).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Thus, COUP-TF serves as an accessory factor required for the induction of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids through both the gAF1 element and the gAF3 element (see Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	47	The goal of this study is to begin to elucidate the mechanism by which COUP-TF acts as a transactivator of transcription.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We first identify the minimal region of the molecule (amino acids 184-423) that confers the transactivation function of COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	49	 This is distinct from the previously described repression domain of COUP-TFI (13).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The activation domain mediates gAF1 and gAF3 accessory activity of the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene, is responsible for transactivation through the CYP7A COUP-TFII binding site, and enables COUP-TFI to function as a coactivator for HNF-4.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	51	 GRIP1 and SRC-1 potentiate the transactivation function of COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, in a system wherein COUP-TF is repressive, these coactivators cannot convert COUP-TFI into an activator.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	53	 GRIP1 and SRC-1 interact with COUP-TFI in vivo, and these interactions require the intact activation domain defined in the function experiments.

0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	83	GAL4 COUP-TFI Confers Both gAF1 and gAF3 Activity-- We have previously demonstrated that the accessory factor activity of COUP-TF is required for a maximal induction of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	84	 COUP-TF accomplishes this by binding to both the gAF1 and gAF3 elements (Refs.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	85	 We first examined whether COUP-TFI can mediate accessory activity while tethered to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) to establish a system that would allow us to map the domain required for the accessory factor activity of COUP-TF.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Constructs were made wherein either gAF1 or gAF3 alone (pGAL4gAF1 and pGAL4gAF3, respectively) or both gAF1 and gAF3 together (pGAL4gAF1 AF3) were replaced by a yeast GAL4 DNA binding site(s) in the context of the wild type PEPCK promoter-CAT fusion gene construct (pPL32) (Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The substitution of gAF1 or gAF3 (or both) by the GAL4 DNA binding element resulted in a 70 to 80% reduction of the glucocorticoid response when compared with pPL32 (compare lines 2-4 with line 1 in Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This loss of function is equivalent to that obtained from mutations that abolish gAF1 or gAF3 activity (25-27, 36).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Cotransfection of a vector that encodes the GAL4DBD with the pGAL4gAF1, pGAL4gAF3, or pGAL4gAF1 AF3 reporter constructs had very little, if any, effect on the glucocorticoid response (lines 1, 3, 5, Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	90	 By contrast, cotransfection of each reporter gene and a plasmid that encodes a chimeric protein consisting of a region of COUP-TFI and the GAL4DBD (GAL4 COUP-TFI156/423) restored the glucocorticoid response to the level found in cells transfected with pPL32 (compare lines 2, 4, and 6 in Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Indeed, in the presence of GAL4 COUP-TFI156/423, the pGAL4gAF3 construct provided a glucocorticoid response that was significantly greater than that provided by pPL32.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This may be explained by the fact that COUP-TF binds with relatively low affinity to gAF3 (26).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus the GAL4DBD provides a higher affinity binding site for COUP-TF in the context of the pGAL4gAF3 construct than is present in the context of the wild type promoter.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The gAF1 and gAF3 elements cannot function as accessory factor elements when either is placed in the position normally occupied by gAF2 (37).

0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	221	COUP-TF, extensively studied as a repressor of transcription, also activates transcription by 1) binding to a nuclear receptor DNA response element and directly activating gene expression, as in the CYP7A gene promoter (9), 2) binding to a DNA element and indirectly influencing expression in the context of several other transcription factors, as in the PEPCK gene GRU (26, 27), and 3) by forming a protein-protein interaction with a DNA-bound factor, such as with HNF-4 in the HNF-1 gene promoter (17).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We show here by analyzing a number of deletion mutations that span the COUP-TFI molecule that a broad region located between amino acids 184-423 is required for these three activation functions.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Furthermore, this same broad region is required for the interaction of COUP-TFI with the coactivators SRC-1 and GRIP1.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	224	 It seems likely that amino acids scattered throughout this segment form the surface(s) required for direct transactivation and for the interaction with other factors.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Although all three functions are equally disrupted by these mutations, we cannot conclude that precisely the same domains are involved in each.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	226	It is perhaps not surprising that the entire E/F domain, also referred to as the ligand binding domain, is required for activation since, in other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, this domain must be intact for transactivation (39).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In addition to transactivation, this domain provides other functions, including nuclear localization and interactions with various coactivators (40).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Although COUP is an orphan receptor that does not bind a known ligand, the other functions of the ligand binding domain may have been compromised by the different mutations that were made in the E/F domain.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The coactivators GRIP1 and SRC-1 interact with the activation function 2 (AF2) domain near the C terminus of many nuclear receptors (39).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	230	 It is noteworthy that the C-terminal 15 amino acids of COUP-TFI that are required for transactivation are not within the domain of COUP-TFI that is homologous with the AF2 domain.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	231	There is significant overlap in the amino acid segments of COUP TF1 that are involved in the opposing actions of transcription repression and activation.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The C-terminal 15 amino acid segment of the protein, which is dispensable for repression (see Fig.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	233	 13), is essential for the activation functions.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	234	 On the other hand, a deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids, which are apparently required for transactivation, also renders COUP-TFI incapable of serving as a repressor.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The corepressors, nuclear receptor corepressor and SMRT, bind to this 35-amino acid segment and confer the repression activity of COUP-TFI (14).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	236	 It is not clear whether other segments of the molecule are also involved in repression.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	237	 By contrast, the E/F domains of COUP-TFII, including the C-terminal 15 amino acids, are required for active repression (15).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We have not studied COUP-TFII as a transactivator, but the accumulated evidence suggests that some very subtle differences between the two COUP molecules account for quite different biologic responses.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	239	Repression and transactivation are presumably facilitated through protein-protein interactions that occur on the E/F region of COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Given that both activation and repression require overlapping sequences, there must be a mechanism in place that allows different sets of proteins to interact with COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	241	 By this view, either a coactivator complex or a corepressor complex is bound to the activation or repression domains within the ligand binding domain of COUP-TFI.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	242	 It is possible that an equilibrium exists between these two complexes so that an excess of one complex or the other determines the direction of the response.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	243	 This explanation seems unlikely for several reasons.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	244	 First, if an equilibrium between coactivator and the corepressor complexes determines the direction of the COUP-TFI response, then at a particular time in a given cell all the COUP-TFI binding sites should mediate either a positive or a negative response.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This is obviously not the case (e.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Furthermore, we show here that overexpression of SRC-1 and GRIP1 fails to switch COUP-TFI from a repressor to an activator in at least one specific instance.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	247	The local intranuclear environment may determine the direction of COUP-TFI activity.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	248	 For example, a given DNA sequence can function as an allosteric effector and influence the activity of a bound transcription factor (41).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	249	 (11) demonstrate that COUP-TFI exists in different conformations when bound to different DNA binding sites.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Hence, a specific DNA sequence may put COUP-TFI into a conformation that exposes surfaces for binding to either coactivator or corepressor complexes.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	251	 This plasticity would allow the COUP-TFI binding site from the CYP7A gene promoter, which was used in the present study, to function as a positive element, whereas another DR4 element, with a slightly different sequence, could serve as a negative element when it binds COUP-TFI (42).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	252	Protein-protein interactions in the context of a specific promoter may also be an important determinant of the direction of COUP-TFI activity.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Whether COUP-TFI acts as a coactivator for HNF-4 or as a transrepressor for nuclear hormone receptors such as retinoic acid receptor is determined by protein-protein interactions, which allow COUP-TFI to associate with either SRC-1/GRIP1 or nuclear receptor corepressor/SMRT.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The interaction of COUP-TFI with HNF-4 is of interest in this regard.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The domain required for the HNF-4 coactivator activity of COUP-TFI is also required for its interaction with SRC-1 and GRIP1 in vivo (Figs.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	256	 It is possible that COUP-TFI interacts with the E region of HNF-4 (amino acids 227-271) and thus provides a surface, either directly or indirectly through coactivators, that associates with the basal transcription machinery (17).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Interestingly, this coactivator activity of COUP-TFI is only seen in DNA sequences that are recognized by HNF-4 but not by COUP-TFI (17).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Thus, COUP-TFI may only serve as a coactivator when HNF-4 exists in a specific conformation induced by DNA binding.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Thus, although GAL4  COUP-TFI acts as a repressor in the context of the (GAL4)5E1bCAT reporter, it acts as a positive accessory factor in the context of the pGAL4gAF1 reporter (compare Figs.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Thus, the action of COUP-TFI is probably determined by the combinatorial effects of the DNA sequence to which it binds and by specific interactions with other proteins, as influenced by specific promoter contexts.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	261	COUP-TF is an important component of the PEPCK gene GRU.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	262	 In addition to glucocorticoids, PEPCK gene transcription is regulated by a number of other hormones.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Each hormone response is mediated by a set of cis-elements termed hormone response units.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Many of the elements within one hormone response unit are also components of another.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	265	 In addition, a number of these pleiotropic elements bind different sets of protein complexes.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	266	 For example, the gAF1 and gAF3 components of the GRU bind COUP-TF (gAF1 can also bind HNF-4) but are also retinoic acid response elements 1 and 2.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In this case, these two elements bind retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers and together comprise the retinoic acid response unit.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It is curious that, although very different combinations of proteins bind, the same DNA contact points are used (43, 44).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Similarly, the insulin response unit and the cAMP response unit share elements with the GRU, and again the proteins that bind to these elements are specific for the hormone response (45, 46).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	270	 This overlapping structure of the PEPCK promoter is termed a metabolic control domain, and we hypothesize that this structure allows for a complex, integrated response of the PEPCK gene, which encodes a protein essential for gluconeogenesis, to a wide variety of environmental signals (26, 37).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	271	Our current view is that different hormone response signals result in the recruitment of different sets of proteins to multiple elements within the promoter, which presumably tether different combinatorial sets of coactivators to the promoter (37).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	272	 For example, the glucocorticoid response requires the recruitment of the ligand-bound GR and associated accessory factors and coactivators to the promoter.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The retinoic acid response requires the recruitment of retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor and associated coactivators, presumably SRC-1-like coactivators.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	274	 These processes are, however, exclusive.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	275	 For example, in the case of the retinoic acid response, the GR and its coactivators are not recruited; hence, the set of proteins bound to the PEPCK promoter during a response to retinoic acid is different from the complexes recruited during a glucocorticoid response.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Indeed, the structural requirements of these responses is different, since a 5-base pair insertion between gAF2 and GR1, which effectively rotates the helix by one-half turn, decreases the glucocorticoid response but has no effect on the retinoic acid response (37).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	277	The binding (or absence of binding) of AFs to gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 has no effect on basal activity (26-28, 37), so it was of great interest to determine whether other proteins interact with COUP-TF, HNF-4, and HNF-3 to confer accessory activity to the glucocorticoid response, particularly since these transcription factors are specifically required to confer accessory factor activity from their particular location within the promoter.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	278	 We have recently demonstrated that HNF-4 binds to both SRC-1 and GRIP1 and that these proteins act as coactivators for HNF-4-mediated transactivation in heterologous promoters and as co-accessory factors for the glucocorticoid response in the PEPCK gene promoter (47).
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Here we show that the same coactivators bind to COUP-TFI and potentiate activation by COUP-TF.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	280	 (27) demonstrate that either HNF-4 or COUP-TF can act as an accessory factor through the gAF1 element.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This observation may now be explained by the observations that both COUP-TF and HNF-4 utilize the same coactivators to promote their transactivation activities (this study and Ref.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	282	In summary, we have characterized the domain required for COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional activation in three different systems and have determined that SRC-1 and GRIP1 bind to this domain and serve as coactivators.
0.49796134.10652338.html.plaintext.txt	283	 This takes us a step closer to understanding how the complex PEPCK gene GRU is assembled and how it functions.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Due to the presence of the activation function module AF-1, HNF4 isoforms originating from the P1 promoter exhibit stronger transcriptional activities and recruit coactivators more efficiently than isoforms driven by the P2 promoter.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Conversely, activities of isoforms produced by both promoters were similarly repressed by the corepressor small heterodimer partner.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	17	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   HEPATOCYTE NUCLEAR FACTOR (HNF) 4 is an orphan nuclear receptor (nuclear receptor 2A1, NR2A1) that activates the expression of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of many nutrients including lipids and glucose (1, 2).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	18	 HNF4 is required for normal hepatic function (3).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	19	 It also plays an important role in pancreatic ss-cells: HNF4 directly activates the insulin gene promoter (4) and is required for glucose-induced insulin secretion (5).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Mutations in HNF4 gene are correlated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1, characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, early onset (usually before the age of 25 yr), and impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion due to dysfunction of pancreatic ss-cells (6).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	21	 HNF4 is involved, together with other transcription factors including HNF1, in a complex transcription factor network that is thought to be crucial for the function of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8, 9).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	22	In mammals, HNF4 is encoded by two different genes: HNF4 and HNF4 (10).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The HNF4 gene potentially encodes nine distinct isoforms.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The expression of HNF4 mainly initiates at the P1 promoter in adult liver and kidney (15).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Recently, two different groups documented the expression of transcripts of the P2 promoter in insulinoma INS-1 cells, as well as in mouse and human pancreatic islets, but did not detect transcripts of the P1 promoter, leading to the conclusion that HNF4 transcription is driven almost exclusively by the P2 promoter in the endocrine pancreas (11, 12, 17).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Strongly contrasting with these data, we observed that HNF4 transcripts initiated at the P1 promoter are substantially expressed, alongside P2 promoter transcripts, in human pancreatic ss-cells and in the rodent pancreatic ss-cell lines RIN m5F and HIT-T15.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Only HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P1 promoter contain the activation function module AF-1, which is encoded by exon 1A.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The AF-1 plays a key role in HNF4 transcriptional potential and in the recruitment of coactivators that are essential for HNF4 function (18, 19, 20).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We show that lack of the AF-1 in HNF4 isoforms initiated at the P2 promoter markedly decreases both the transcriptional potential and interaction with several coactivators.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	120	 First, we checked the specificity of amplification of P1 promoter transcripts with the a+b primer set: cloned HNF42 yielded a highly visible band, but no band could be detected with cloned HNF48 (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	121	 1H, lanes 1 and 2, respectively).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Second, using cloned HNF42 and HNF48, we verified that primer sets a+b and d+b exhibited similar amplification efficiency (data not shown).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Third, using human pancreatic islets, we made sure that the band obtained for P1 transcripts did not result from a genomic or plasmidic contamination during RNA isolation or reverse transcription: no amplicon could be detected when the step of reverse transcription of RNAs was performed in the absence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Conversely, use of another set of primers (h and g), designed to specifically amplify exon 1A and 2, yielded with RNAs from human islets a band that was not obtained when reverse transcription was omitted (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	125	 1J), thus confirming that transcripts of the HNF4 P1 promoter are readily expressed in endocrine pancreas.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	126	Human pancreatic ss-cells express HNF4 isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and HNF4 HNF4 transcripts from promoter P1 mainly represent isoforms 1 and 2, and transcripts from promoter P2 mainly represent isoforms 7 and 8, because we determined that very low levels of isoforms 3 to 6 and 9 were expressed in the cells tested.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This result confirms the very low, if any, expression of isoforms 4 to 6.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	131	Because the insertion of 10 amino acid residues in the carboxy-terminal sequence of HNF42 was shown to facilitate recruitment of coactivators (31), we analyzed the expression of isoforms containing the 30-bp insert in ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Primers e and f, hybridizing to exons 9 and 10, respectively, were designed to amplify two fragments, the larger one containing the 30-bp insert of isoforms 2 and 8 (Fig.

0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	212	 But until now, HNF4 expression was not documented in human pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	213	 In our study on human islets and isolated pancreatic ss-cells, we observed that transcripts of the P1 promoter were significantly expressed, as were those of the P2 promoter.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This indicates that HNF4 expression does not exclusively initiate at the P2 promoter in human pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Similar results were observed in the rat RIN m5F and hamster HIT-T15 pancreatic ss-cell lines.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Several controls confirmed the accuracy of our results.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Importantly, we confirmed expression of P1 transcripts in the pancreatic ss-cell line HIT-T15 by immunodetecting HNF4 proteins containing the amino-terminal sequence encoded by exon 1A.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Lack of detection of promoter P1 transcripts in islets by Ferrer s group (12, 17) may be explained by a low amplification efficiency of the P1 promoter transcripts.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This may account for the weak intensity they obtained for the exon 1A+2 band in liver, relative to that of exon 1D+2 band in islets (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	220	 17), although isoforms 1 and 2 are by far more abundant in liver than isoforms 7 and 8 in islets.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In concordance with the considerable difference in expression (32), primers amplifying exons 8 to 10 contained in the four isoforms 1, 2, 7 and 8 yielded bands of much stronger intensity for isoforms 1 + 2 in liver than for isoforms 7 + 8 in islets (Fig.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	222	A mutation in the HNF4 P1 promoter significantly decreasing the promoter s activity is associated with diabetes (41).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This suggests that promoter P1 transcription may be important for normal pancreatic ss-cell function.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In addition, a HNF42 clone was isolated from a human pancreatic islet cDNA library, also arguing for the expression of HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in endocrine pancreas (Furuta, H.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	225	Controversial results were obtained concerning HNF4 expression in exocrine pancreas (12, 32).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We confirmed results described in Ref.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	227	 32 stating that HNF4 was poorly expressed in the exocrine pancreas.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	228	Compared with isoform 7, isoform 1 is a stronger transcriptional activator in nonpancreatic ss-cells except on promoters of genes that are expressed early in liver (15, 16, 42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Our functional studies showed that the transcriptional potential of HNF42 was significantly stronger than that of isoform 8 in models of pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Interestingly, these results were obtained on the promoter of HNF1, which plays a crucial role in these cells (7, 9, 43, 44).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Because HNF1 expression is regulated by HNF4 in pancreatic ss-cells (5, 45), we suggest that expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter producing isoforms 1 and 2 is most probably of major importance in pancreatic ss-cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	232	 From our data obtained with HNF42 containing a mutated AF-1, we can infer that the difference in transcriptional potential between isoforms 2 and 8 was due to the lack of the AF-1 module in the latter isoform.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	233	Furthermore, lack of AF-1 in HNF4 resulted in a decreased interaction with p300 and GRIP-1 coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Interaction with p300 was studied using a fragment (amino acids 340 to 528) that interacts with both the HNF4 AF-1 and AF-2 (20).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Despite interaction through the AF-2, we observed a marked decrease in binding of HNF4 lacking the AF-1, thus highlighting the substantial contribution of AF-1 to the interaction with p300.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Consistent with this result, we observed that p300 enhanced the transcriptional potential of isoform 2 more efficiently than that of isoform 8 and HNF42 with a mutated AF-1.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Interestingly, the AF-1 module is also required for the synergistic action of p300 and GRIP-1 to enhance the HNF4 transcriptional activity (42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	238	In contrast to these coactivators, the corepressor SHP interacted similarly with HNF42 and 8 and repressed their transcriptional activity to similar extents.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This strongly suggests that SHP-mediated recruitment of transcriptional inhibitor(s) is not AF-1 dependent.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), another HNF4 corepressor (46), was shown to interact similarly with HNF41 and HNF47 (42).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	241	 It appears therefore that the HNF4 AF-1 interacts only with coactivators whereas the AF-2 interacts with both coactivators and corepressors in a mutually exclusive fashion.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Because the balance between coactivators and corepressors is crucial for HNF4 transcriptional activity (38, 46), lack of the AF-1 in isoforms 7 and 8 most probably results in a shift toward a lower ability to recruit coactivators and a subsequent lower coactivator-mediated enhancement of HNF4 transcriptional potential.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	243	 SHP is highly expressed in human pancreatic islets (Moerman, E.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	244	, unpublished results) and may serve as an important checkpoint to balance the activity of the transcriptional network of pancreatic ss-cells (7, 8).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In these cells in which the HNF4 AF-2 has a high probability to be occupied by SHP, the transcriptional activity of isoforms containing the AF-1 may be more efficiently enhanced by coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Thus, even if the AF-1-dependent cofactor-mediated modulations of HNF4 transcriptional activity observed in this study and in Ref.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	247	 42 remain to be shown in pancreatic ss-cells, our results strongly argue for an essential role of the promoter P1-driven HNF4 isoforms in these cells.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	248	A cross-regulatory loop between HNF1 and HNF4 has been evidenced in pancreatic ss-cells, as reviewed in Refs.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In the model proposed by Ferrer (9), activation of the HNF1 promoter by HNF4 is crucial to maintain HNF1 expression above the threshold level required to hold the HNF1/HNF4 circuit in the switch-ON state and, consequently, to avoid ss-cell dysfunction and development of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (9).
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Expression of the HNF4 P1 promoter transcripts in pancreatic ss-cells is probably crucial to maintain this circuit in the switch-ON state.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Indeed, HNF4 is expressed at a limiting amount in ss-cells, and, among isoforms 1, 2, 7, 8, and , only the first two contain the AF-1 module, which confers a stronger transcriptional potential and leads to a more efficient recruitment of coactivators.
0.29775548.12697672.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Thus, expression of isoforms 1 and 2 is likely of crucial importance in the transcriptional network controlling pancreatic islet function.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	3	The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4[alpha] (HNF4[alpha]) is a tissue specific transcription factor mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, intestine and the endocrine pancreas, but is also an essential regulator for early embryonic events.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Based on its protein structure HNF4[alpha] is classified as an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Comparing HNF4[alpha] transcription factors in the differentiated and dedifferentiated murine hepatocyte cell line MHSV-12 we identified in dedifferentiated cells the novel splice variant HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This variant is characterized by an alternative first exon and has a lower transactivation potential in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	7	 HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA and the corresponding protein are expressed in the undifferentiated pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell line F9, whereas HNF4[alpha]1 only appears after differentiation of F9 cells to visceral endoderm.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	8	 HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is also found in totipotent embryonic stem cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, the function of HNF4[alpha]7 seems not to be restricted to embryonic cells as the HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is also present in adult tissues, most notably the stomach.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	10	 All these features suggest that the presence of distinct splice variants of HNF4[alpha] modulates the activity of HNF4[alpha] in a cell type specific way.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	11	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) constitutes a transcription factor family (1 ,2 ) whose first member HNF4[alpha] has been identified as a factor interacting with promoter elements mediating liver specific transcription (3 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Based on the zinc finger motif of the DNA binding domain and on a potential ligand binding domain HNF4 is classified as a member of the nuclear orphan receptor superfamily (4 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	13	 HNF4[alpha] turned out to be present also in non-hepatic cells such as kidney, intestine, stomach and pancreas (5 -7 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The importance of HNF4[alpha] in gene control in tissues distinct from the liver has been documented by the fact that a human inherited disease is based on the expression of a mutated HNF4[alpha] gene in the endocrine pancreas leading to maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1; 8 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In addition to the role of HNF4[alpha] as a tissue specific transcription factor it functions also in early embryogenesis: in the Xenopus egg we identified the HNF4[alpha] protein as a maternal transcription factor that contributes to the zygotic activation of the gene encoding HNF1[alpha] (9 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In mouse embryos HNF4[alpha] transcripts have been identified in the primary endoderm as early as day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	17	5 and later in the liver diverticulum, the gut and nephrogenic tissues starting from day 8.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The early embryonic requirement of HNF4[alpha] is well established in the mouse, as the knock-out of the HNF4[alpha] gene leads to a disturbance of gastrulation and thus to early embryonic lethality (11 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The embryonic role of HNF4 seems to be evolutionary conserved, as maternal HNF4 mRNA has been identified in the Drosophila egg.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Furthermore, a large chromosomal deletion spanning the HNF4 locus results in defects in the gut and malpighian tubules of the developing Drosophila and these malformations are interpreted that HNF4 plays similar functions in invertebrates and vertebrates (7 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	21	In addition to HNF4[alpha] we have recently identified two other members of the HNF4 family, i.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	22	 HNF4[beta] in Xenopus (2 ) and HNF4[gamma] in humans (1 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both these new members of the HNF4 family seem to have distinct but overlapping functions compared to HNF4[alpha], since both gene products show a differential expression pattern and a distinct transactivation potential of HNF4 dependent reporter genes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	24	Further complexity of gene control by HNF4[alpha] transcription factors is apparently given by the differential splicing of the 10 initially identified exons of the HNF4[alpha] gene (6 ,8 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus far, six distinct splice variants of HNF4[alpha] have been identified in human and murine cDNA samples.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We use the nomenclature most recently used for the human splice variants (12 ): HNF4[alpha]1 represents the initially identified transcript (3 ) and HNF4[alpha]2 through HNF4[alpha]6 are the splice variants identified subsequently.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	27	 HNF4[alpha]2 is a splice variant that contains a larger exon 9 resulting in an insertion of 10 additional amino acids in the Pro-rich C-terminal part and has been identified in the rat (13 ), the mouse (14 ) and human (1 ,15 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	28	 HNF4[alpha]3 initially refered to as HNF-4C (16 ) has been identified in human liver cDNA and is characterized by a shorter and distinct C-terminus, whereas HNF4[alpha]4 found in human kidney and liver RNA contains in the N-terminal region the two additional exons 1B and 1C (1 ,12 ).

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We speculate that all these splice variants have unique properties allowing a modulation of the HNF4[alpha] activity.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Indeed, we have shown in transient transfection assays using HNF4 dependent reporter genes, that HNF4[alpha]4 has a lower transactivation potential compared to HNF4[alpha]2 (1 ).

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	33	The broad spectrum of tissues expressing HNF4[alpha] argues for a function of HNF4[alpha] in the establishment of the differentiation of various cell types, but most data concerning the role of HNF4[alpha] have been investigated in hepatic cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Most notably, the presence of HNF4[alpha] expression has been correlated with the differentiated phenotype of hepatocytes (reviewed in 17 ) .
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In fact, it has been shown that the introduction of HNF4[alpha] in dedifferentiated hepatocytes can lead to a redifferentiation as shown by the activation of several liver specific functions (18 -20 ), whereas the forced expression of a dominant negative mutant down-regulates several liver specific genes in differentiated hepatoma cells (21 ,22 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	36	In the present report we analyzed in the murine cell line MHSV-12 the highly differentiated hepatic phenotype that is reversibly decreased in serum-containing culture medium (23 ).

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	67	It is well established that the composition of the culture medium has a profound effect on the differentiation state of hepatocytes (23 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In general the presence of serum leads to substantial dedifferentiation of the hepatic phenotype.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To explore whether the cultivation conditions of hepatocytes has any effect on the expression of tissue specific transcription factors known to be responsible for the hepatic phenotype, we determined the presence of liver transcription factors in the immortalized murine hepatic cell line MHSV-12.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This cell line has been found to express most abundantly transcripts of liver specific proteins such as albumin, aldolase A and B as well as tyrosine amino transferase, but this liver specific expression pattern is reversibly decreased in serum containing medium (23 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Analyzing the expression of HNF1[alpha] in the MHSV-12 cell line cultured under various conditions we did not detect any change in this transcription factor (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, probing HNF4[alpha] in gel retardation assays using various antibodies we detected some significant differences: as illustrated in Figure 1 A, in extracts of MHSV-12 cells grown in serum-free MX83 medium, that maintains a highly differentiated hepatic phenotype (23 ), HNF4[alpha] could readily be detected in gel retardation experiments (lane 1) and this DNA-protein complex could be supershifted by an antibody raised against the A/B-domain or the F-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lanes 2 and 3, respectively).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In contrast, in extracts derived from MHSV-12 cells cultivated in the presence of serum, that leads to a dramatic dedifferentiation (23 ), we observed that the HNF4[alpha] protein detected in gel retardation assays (lane 4) did not react with the antibody specific for the A/B-domain of HNF4[alpha] (lane 5).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, in the same extracts the presence of HNF4[alpha] protein could be verified with the antibody specific for the F-domain (lane 6).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	75	 These results imply that the properties of HNF4[alpha] change in MHSV-12 cells depending on the culture conditions.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The HNF4[alpha] protein of MHSV-12 cells reacts with the A/B-domain specific antibody depending on the conditions used to culture the cells.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The type of HNF4[alpha] protein present in MHSV-12 cells is dependent on glucocorticoids.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	84	To identify the components in the culture medium that change the properties of the HNF4[alpha] protein, we cultivated the MHSV-12 cells in MX83 medium lacking defined components and analyzed the extracts of these cells in the gel retardation assay using the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	85	 As Figure 1 B illustrates, the omission of hydrocortisone in the culture medium results in cell extracts with HNF4[alpha] protein that mostly cannot be supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody (lanes 3 and 4).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In contrast extracts derived from cultures grown in the absence of EGF (lanes 1 and 2) or insulin (lanes 5 and 6) contain HNF4[alpha] that is predominantly supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consequently, the presence of hydrocortisone in the serum-free medium leads to the expression of the HNF4[alpha] form that is recognized by the A/B-domain specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	88	In a complementary approach we investigated the effect of the glucocorticoid hormone on HNF4[alpha] expression in MHSV-12 cells grown with serum.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	89	 As shown in the gel retardation assay of Figure 1 C, a 24 h incubation with dexamethasone leads to a substantial amount of HNF4[alpha] protein that is recognized by the A/B-domain specific antibody (lane 5).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Since this dexamethasone mediated change can be inhibited by RU486, a well known antagonist binding to the glucocorticoid receptor as a competitor of the glucocorticoid (lane 8), we assume that the effect is mediated by the nuclear hormone receptor.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	91	The findings with the cells grown without serum as well as the data with the cultures maintained in serum, both imply that a glucocorticoid mediated event alters the properties of the HNF4[alpha] protein in such a way that it is recognized by the A/B specific antibody.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The novel HNF4[alpha]7 protein is encoded by a differential splice variant of the HNF4[alpha] gene.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	93	The differential recognition of HNF4[alpha] by the A/B-domain specific antibody could either reflect a protein modification or a change in the amino acid sequence in the N-terminus of the HNF4[alpha] protein.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To distinguish between these two alternatives we transfected an expression vector encoding the originally described rat HNF4[alpha] protein (3 ) into MHSV-12 cells grown in the presence of serum, i.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Analyzing increasing amounts of extracts derived from these transfected cell lines by gel retardation assays we observed a concentration dependent appearance of a HNF4[alpha] protein that can be supershifted by the A/B-domain specific antibody (marked by an arrow head in lanes 2 and 5 in Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	97	 2 ), whereas in extracts of mock transfected cells no HNF4[alpha] protein could be supershifted by the A/B specific antibody (lanes 8 and 11).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Using the F-domain specific antibody no qualitative difference could be seen between the HNF4[alpha] transfected cells and the control, but the supershifted band was stronger in the extract of the transfected cells (compare lanes 3 and 6 with lanes 9 and 12).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	99	 These results rule out the possibility that protein modification plays a major role but rather imply that the transfected HNF4[alpha] encodes a protein that is distinct in its amino acid sequence from the protein expressed in undifferentiated MHSV-12 cells.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	116	To prove the assumption that in MHSV-12 cells the endogenous HNF4[alpha] protein differs in its amino acid sequence from the cloned sequence, we analyzed the HNF4[alpha] mRNA derived from cells cultivated in the presence of serum.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	117	 As the difference in the HNF4[alpha] protein is only detected with the monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal A/B-domain, we suspected a distinct 5'-end of the HNF4[alpha] mRNA.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Therefore, we generated by reverse transcription a cDNA starting in the D-domain (primer HN7 in Fig.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The loss of identity is exactly at the same position in the shorter cDNA clone (data not shown), thus excluding a cloning artefact.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	123	 As the loss of identity corresponds in both cases to the position of the exon 1-exon 2 boundary (6 ), we anticipate that the new cDNA encodes a novel splice variant of the HNF4[alpha] gene we refer to as HNF4[alpha]7.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The presence of this splice variant was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers specific for the [alpha]7 splice variant.

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	177	 As shown in Figure 6 both these transcripts can be identified in the liver and the stomach (lanes 1 and 3), whereas in the kidney and to a smaller extent in the intestine only the HNF4[alpha]1 transcript can be detected.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In the pancreas only small amounts of HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are present.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	179	 But the significance of this finding is questionable as the GAPDH mRNA cannot be seen probably because the pancreatic RNase was not sufficiently inhibited during RNA preparation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, traces of HNF4[alpha]7 RNA were also detected in the ovary, heart, bladder and brain, where no HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts and normal levels of GAPDH RNA were observed.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Clearly, the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants are expressed differentially in the various tissues analyzed.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	182	 By quantification of the PCR products in a phosphor imager we estimate that in the stomach about a third of the HNF4[alpha] transcripts correspond to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant (lane 3).

0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	185	Our initial experiments leading to the identification of the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant implied some correlation of the novel splice variant with the undifferentiated phenotype of the hepatocytes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Therefore, we investigated the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in the murine embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 that resembles the pluripotent stem cells of the inner cell mass of the early mouse embryo.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	187	 This cell line can can be differentiated into distinct endodermal cell types upon retinoic acid treatment.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Most interestingly these stem cells can be differentiated by retinoic acid treatment into visceral endoderm when they are cultured in suspension as aggregates and these cell types share properties of hepatocytes (24 ,32 ) .
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Based on RT-PCR we succeeded to show that undifferentiated F9 cells contain exclusively the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant ( Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	190	 7 A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the differentiated cell population contains the HNF4[alpha]1 as well as the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants (lanes 3 and 4).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	191	 From three independent experiments we estimated by quantification in a phosphor imager a 15-fold increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA upon differentiation into visceral endoderm, whereas the level of HNF4[alpha]1 transcripts increased from undetectable levels to a value ~60% of the amount of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcript.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Since in the immortalized hepatic MHSV-12 cells grown in the presence of serum, the balance between HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is altered by the addition of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	193	 1 ), we wondered whether a similar effect is seen in F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	194	 As Figure 7 A demonstrates the expression pattern of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 is not changed upon dexamethasone treatment in either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	195	To determine whether the presence of the HNF4[alpha]7 transcript in the embryonal cell line F9 also reflects the expression of the corresponding protein, we prepared nuclear extracts from F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In gel retardation assays with extracts from undifferentiated F9 cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	197	 7 B) we could detect a supershift with the F-domain specific antibody (lane 3) and the A/B/C-domain specific antibody (lane 4) but no reaction with the A/B-domain specific antibody (lane 2).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In contrast in F9 cells differentiated into visceral endoderm a supershift was seen with each of the three antibodies (lanes 6, 7 and 8).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This result is consistent with the RT-PCR analysis and implies that undifferentiated F9 cells contain HNF4[alpha]7 protein, whereas HNF4[alpha]1 as well as HNF4[alpha]7 proteins are present in differentiated F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	200	To further investigate the early embryonic expression of HNF4[alpha]7 we searched for the corresponding transcript in the totipotent embryonic stem cell line E14-1.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The RT-PCR analysis given in Figure 7 C demonstrates the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA in this embryonal stem cell (lane 2), whereas the RNA sample derived from the feeder cells used for the ES cell culture lack any HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts (lane 3).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Probing the same ES cell RNA for the HNF4[alpha]1 mRNA we did not detect any transcript (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	203	From the analysis of both the F9 cells and the ES cells we conclude that the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA is a characteristic of undifferentiated embryonic cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	204	The novel splice variant HNF4[alpha]7 is expressed as the exclusive HNF4[alpha] transcript in the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 and the ES cell line E14-1.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The transcript is also found in the hepatocyte cell line MHSV-12 that has been established by immortalization of embryonic hepatocytes.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In this immortalized hepatic cell culture HNF4[alpha]7 predominates provided these cells are cultured under conditions that lead to dedifferentiation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In this context it is important to stress that the MHSV-12 cell line dedifferentiated by serum addition has far more hepatic characters than the dedifferentiated hepatoma cell lines C2 and H5 that both lack any HNF4[alpha] and HNF1[alpha] transcription factors (18 ,32 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	208	Recently, the expression of HNF4[alpha] has been investigated in the ES cell line D3 (33 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Under differentiating conditions allowing the formation of embryoid bodies the appearance of HNF4[alpha] RNA has been observed, but no signal was detected in the undifferentiated embryonic stem cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The lack of HNF4[alpha] transcripts in undifferentiated ES cells probably reflects the insensitivity of the Northern blots compared to our RT-PCR assay as these authors used a full length cDNA probe that would hybridize also to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	211	The presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in various embryonic cell types suggests that this novel HNF4[alpha] splice variant has some function during early embryogenesis.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Early embryonic expression of the HNF4[alpha] gene starting in the primary endoderm at embryonic day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	213	5 of the mouse has been documented by in situ hybridization (10 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	214	 As the probe used in these experiments did not differentiate between the [alpha]1 and [alpha]7 splice variant, the identity of this signal in respect to the splice variants is not clear.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, another in situ hybridization used a genomic fragment of the exon 1 of the original HNF4[alpha] transcript (6 ) and thus, in retrospect, was a HNF4[alpha]1 specific probe.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	216	 With this probe HNF4[alpha] transcripts were first localised only on day 7 p.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	217	 in visceral extraembryonic endoderm.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This detection at a later time point in embryogenesis could well reflect the fact that this probe could not hybridize to the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Similarly, the relatively late appearance of HNF4[alpha] binding activity in gel retardation assays starting at 8.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	220	 (25 ) might also be interpreted as a lack of reactivity of the antibody with the HNF4[alpha]7 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Therefore, by indirect evidence the earlier appearance of HNF4[alpha]7 compared to HNF4[alpha]1, we have seen in the differentiating F9 cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	222	 7A and B) matches the available data in the developing embryo.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	223	Analyzing 200 unfertilized mouse eggs we could not identify HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA whereas GAPDH mRNA was readily detectable (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	224	 As unfertilized mouse eggs are about 20 times larger than the ES cells, the input RNA in the RT-PCR corresponds to ~4000 ES cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Since in such an ES cell aliquot we could identify the HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA, we assume that HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are absent in the egg and accumulate by zygotic transcription in early mouse embryogenesis.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This is consistent with the appearance of HNF4[alpha] transcripts in in situ hybridization experiments with a probe detecting HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 only at day 4.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Therefore, it seems unlikely that HNF4[alpha] mRNA is a maternal component in mammals.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	228	 This is in contrast to Drosophila HNF4 (7 ) and Xenopus HNF4[beta] mRNA (2 ) that are known to be present as maternal transcripts.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	229	 However, the HNF4[alpha] protein itself might be a maternal component of the mammalian egg, a situation we have found for the HNF4[alpha] protein in Xenopus whose corresponding mRNA has disappeared at the egg stage (2 ,34 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	230	An early function of HNF4[alpha] gene expression in mammals has been established by the disruption of the gene that results in an impaired gastrulation and early embryonic lethality (11 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	231	 As the targeting vector used in these knock-out experiments lacked exon 2 and 3, the HNF4[alpha]1 as well as the HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts are devoid of the DNA binding domain.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Therefore, it is not clear at the moment which HNF4[alpha] transcripts plays the essential function at this early embryonic stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	233	 It should also be considered that the partial rescue of HNF4[alpha] knock-out embryos observed by supplementing the developing embryo with normal visceral endoderm (35 ) might be an effect relieving only one of the two HNF4[alpha] splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	234	We assume that the presence of HNF4[alpha]7 in the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 and in the embryonic stem cell E14-1 reflects already some first step of embryonic gene regulation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Consistent with this interpretation the presence of transcripts encoding the tissue specific transcription factor HNF1[alpha] has been reported in undifferentiated F9 cells (25 ,36 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Since it is well established that HNF1[alpha] is a potential target gene of HNF4[alpha] (18 -20 ,26 ,37 ), we consider the possibility that HNF4[alpha]7 triggers HNF1[alpha] expression at this early stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	237	 However, the significance of such a potential effect is questionable as the HNF1[alpha] transcripts are of aberrant size and no HNF1[alpha] protein can be detected in F9 cells (25 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	238	Our analysis demonstrates that HNF4[alpha]7 is not restricted to embryonic tissues as it is also found abundantly in the stomach of the adult mouse (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	239	 In contrast, in the liver and intestine, HNF4[alpha]7 transcripts constitute only a minor fraction as compared to HNF4[alpha]1 and in the ovary, heart, bladder and brain only traces can be found.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	240	 It will be most interesting to investigate whether in these tissues HNF4[alpha]7 is restricted to a subpopulation of cells, e.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	241	Our finding that the transactivation potential of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants differs in transient transfection assays and that the extent of this effect depends on the cell type used (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	242	 5 ), indicates that the two HNF4[alpha] splice variants cooperate differentially with other transcription factors.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	243	 As the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants have distinct N-termini, we expect that this domain determines the differential cooperation.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Therefore, we exclude the reported interaction with COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (38 ) as well as the binding to HNF1[alpha] (39 ) as the mechanisms mediating the distinct properties of of HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7, since these interactions involve the C-terminus common to HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	245	 However, the specific binding observed with the basal transcription factor TFIIB (40 ) might trigger the distinct properties of the two splice variants, as the formation of this complex requires the N-terminus of HNF4[alpha] (38 ,40 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Alternatively, HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 may exert distinct activities due to differential heterodimerization with other members of the HNF4 family (1 ,2 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	247	 But we would not expect differential heterodimerization with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, since HNF4[alpha] seems usually not to heterodimerize with these components (41 ,42 ).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	248	Analyzing the expression of the HNF4[alpha] splice variants we revealed that HNF4[alpha]7 is under a complex regulatory network.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In the hepatic cell line MHSV-12 the glucocorticoid plays a major role as the lack of this hormone seems to be a critical component for the appearance of HNF4[alpha]7.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Clearly, the glucocorticoid hormone alters the balance between the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	251	 As glucocorticoids are known to trigger the final stage of hepatic differentiation at birth (43 ), we have investigated the expression of these two HNF4[alpha] splice variants.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Using liver extracts from 2 days before birth up to 2 days after birth we could not see any change (data not shown).
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In fact, as all the HNF4 binding activity observed in gel retardation assays could be supershifted by the A/B specific antibody at all stages analyzed, we have no data to support a major change in HNF4[alpha] splice variants at birth, although glucocorticoid action is an essential step at this developmental stage.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	254	 A lack of glucocorticoid control was also seen in F9 cells.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Neither in undifferentiated nor in differentiated F9 cells the addition of dexamethasone altered the level of the HNF4[alpha]1 and HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	256	 On the other hand in these F9 cells the retinoic acid mediated differentiation to visceral endoderm leads to an increase in HNF4[alpha]7 mRNA but more significantly also to the appearance of the HNF4[alpha]1 splice variant.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	257	 This change in HNF4[alpha] expression can also be seen on the protein level, as HNF4 binding activity reacting with the anti A/B antibody is only detected in the differentiated cells (Fig.
0.49359712.9421506.html.plaintext.txt	258	Our data show that the splice variant HNF4[alpha]7 contains a distinct first exon.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We have examined whether chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is involved in this transcriptional regulation.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We analyzed COUP-TF and StAR mRNA and protein levels in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	10	 COUP-TF protein was readily detectable in nonstimulated cells, and AngII markedly reduced its expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1 nM), to 46  plus or minus  4.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Finally, by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have shown a direct interaction between COUP-TF and the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These results suggest that COUP-TF exerts a tonic inhibition on steroidogenesis by repressing StAR protein expression and that activators of aldosterone biosynthesis lift this inhibition in part by repressing COUP-TF levels.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	19	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   THE MAIN MINERALOCORTICOID, aldosterone, is synthesized primarily in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, under the control of three major physiological stimuli, the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII), ACTH, and extracellular potassium (K+) (1).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Aldosterone is synthesized from cholesterol, the common precursor of all steroid hormones, which is stored within intracellular lipid droplets as cholesterol esters and mobilized to the mitochondrion by cholesterol ester hydrolase upon stimulation (2).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The rate-limiting step in the activation of steroidogenesis is the delivery of cholesterol from the mitochondrial outer membrane to the inner membrane, where the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme is located (3).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Within the mitochondria, cholesterol undergoes an enzymatic cascade leading eventually to the formation of aldosterone.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	23	This crucial step of intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer is performed by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein (4, 5).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The ultimate demonstration of the indispensable role of the StAR protein came from congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, an inherited disease that leads to a dramatic deficiency in all steroid hormones and in which loss of function mutations have been discovered in the StAR gene (6).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because the StAR protein mediates the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, its expression must be finely regulated.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Indeed, in human NCI-H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, hormone-stimulated StAR protein synthesis and steroid production are prevented by inhibition of RNA synthesis (7).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture, mimicking the calcium signal gener ated by AngII leads to increased expression of StAR mRNA and protein (8).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Similarly, treatment of human NCI-H295R cells with AngII results in an increase in StAR mRNA levels within 30 min, with maximal levels being reached within 6 h (7, 9).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These results clearly indicate a transcriptional regulation of AngII on StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Various consensus response elements have been identified in the StAR gene promoter (10).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Although promoter mapping studies have provided extensive information on activators of the StAR gene, the role of transcription factors that repress StAR protein expression has received less attention.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The best characterized repressor of the StAR gene is DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1), a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family (11, 12, 13).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that AngII powerfully represses DAX-1 expression in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, thus leading to increased StAR expression and aldosterone production (14).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	34	Another potential candidate for a negative regulation of the StAR gene is chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF), which is usually present as two isoforms, COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (15, 16).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These orphan members of the steroid receptor superfamily play distinct and crucial roles in fetal development of the nervous (17) and cardiovascular (18) systems.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition to these well-established developmental effects in fetal life, the following pieces of evidence suggest a direct or indirect interaction between COUP-TF and the promoter of the StAR gene and thus an involvement of COUP-TF in adult steroidogenic cell function.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	37	 First, COUP-TF colocalizes in the nuclei of the adrenal cells with DAX-1 and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), two transcription factors involved in steroidogenesis and in StAR regulation, and its expression is modulated in adrenocortical adenomas, COUP-TFI being lower in aldosterone-producing tumors than in normal tissue (19, 20) and COUP-TFII appearing to be increased in aldosteronoma cells (21).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In normal adrenocortical tissue, COUP-TFI and -II expression levels appear to be qualitatively equivalent (20).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Second, it has been recently shown that SF-1 and COUP-TF can activate and repress, respectively, bovine CYP17 gene transcription in Y-1 mouse adrenocortical cells (22, 23).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Third, a similar competition between SF-1 and COUP-TF for a composite binding site has been demonstrated for other genes involved in steroidogenesis, including human aldosterone synthase, aromatase, and murine DAX-1 genes (23, 24, 25).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Taken together, these data raise the question of a possible negative role of COUP-TF in the regulation of StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	42	In the present work, we have therefore examined whether COUP-TFs are involved in the regulation of basal and AngII- or ACTH-induced aldosterone biosynthesis in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Our results show clearly that COUP-TF is a negative regulator of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	157	Finally, this interaction was confirmed by in vivo analysis of the physical interaction between COUP-TFI and the StAR promoter, using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.

0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	160	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The StAR protein plays a rate-limiting, pivotal role in the activation of steroidogenesis (5).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The present study was undertaken in an attempt to investigate the mechanism(s) of the known induction of StAR protein expression in adrenal glomerulosa cells in response to two physiological activators of aldosterone biosynthesis, the octapeptide hormone AngII and ACTH (9, 33).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Specifically, we have examined a possible role of COUP-TF proteins in this process.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	163	Four main conclusions can be drawn from the present work: 1) COUP-TF proteins are abundantly present in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells in primary culture and are repressed by AngII and forskolin; 2) COUP-TFI and -II repress AngII-induced StAR mRNA and protein expression; 3) COUP-TFI and -II overexpression prevents AngII-induced mineralocorticoid biosynthesis; 4) COUP-TFI interacts directly with the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	164	First, in agreement with previous immunohistochemical studies performed in mice (18), we detected high basal COUP-TF protein levels in resting bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In man, recent studies have shown that COUP-TF expression is inversely correlated with steroid production in adrenocortical tumors (20).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	166	 These data suggested that this transcription factor could function as a repressor of steroidogenesis and that the mechanism of action of physiological activators of steroid production, such as AngII or ACTH (mimicked by forskolin), could operate, in part, through a reduction of COUP-TF protein levels.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Indeed, as shown in the present study, both AngII and forskolin strongly diminished COUP-TF mRNA and protein expression, over a range of concentrations similar to those used to induce aldosterone production.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	168	Second, we observed that COUP-TFI and -II repressed StAR mRNA and protein expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Because the StAR protein controls the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, we hypothesized that COUP-TF might act at this level.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	170	 COUP-TF is known to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of SF-1 and to repress various actors in the steroidogenic cascade (23, 34), such as the gene encoding cytochrome P450 steroid 17-hydroxylase, by competing with SF-1 for the binding to repeated cAMP-responsive sequences spaced by six nucleotides (repCRS2) (35).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Furthermore, COUP-TF and SF-1 have also been shown to bind to overlapping binding sites involved in the regulation of the oxytocin gene in the bovine ovary (36).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although multiple SF-1 binding elements required for hormonal induction have been identified in the StAR protein gene 5'-flanking promoter region (10, 37, 38), COUP-TF has not been reported, so far, to bind to the StAR promoter or to affect its activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Interestingly, our laboratory has demonstrated recently that the levels of another orphan nuclear receptor, DAX-1, which is known to repress StAR protein expression also by interacting negatively with SF-1 either directly or indirectly (12), are down-regulated by AngII and forskolin in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and that this effect is correlated inversely with StAR protein expression and aldosterone biosynthesis (14).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	174	We therefore examined whether COUP-TF could repress StAR expression levels by overexpressing the transcription factor in bovine glomerulosa cells.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	175	 To overcome the usually low rates of efficiency observed in these cells when utilizing classical transfection reagents, we have used an HIV-derived lentiviral system yielding high levels of gene delivery in primary cells (27, 28).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Indeed, infected bovine glomerulosa cells expressed high amounts of exogenous, murine COUP-TFI and -II mRNA that could be distinguished from endogenous COUP-TF mRNAs by using species-specific primers for the RT-PCR amplification.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Moreover, we show here that overexpression of either isoform of COUP-TF resulted in a complete suppression of AngII-induced StAR mRNA and protein induction, a finding strongly suggesting a direct or indirect repressor role for COUP-TF on StAR promoter activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These results were indeed confirmed by luciferase reporter gene assay of the StAR promoter in cells overexpressing COUP-TF, which showed a dramatic reduction in AngII-induced StAR promoter activity.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	179	 COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII were equally effective in repressing StAR mRNA expression, although only the latter has been shown to be expressed in the cortex of the adrenal gland during organogenesis in mice (18).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	180	 However, both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII have been shown to be present in normal and tumoral human adrenocortical tissue in immunohistological studies (19, 21), and we observed a similar expression pattern of the mRNA of both isoforms in bovine glomerulosa cells (data not shown).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	181	Third, at the functional level, we observed an inverse relationship between mRNA COUP-TF levels and AngII-induced aldosterone output, a finding that corroborates our hypothesis that the hormone acts by lifting the repression exerted by COUP-TF on StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Interestingly, overexpression of COUP-TFs did not affect either basal StAR expression or basal aldosterone production.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This result was actually expected, in view of the robust expression of endogenous COUP-TFs in bovine glomerulosa cells, which presumably already exert a maximal repressor effect on these parameters in the resting state.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Only under conditions of stimulation with AngII, when endogenous COUP-TFs are repressed, is the effect of overexpressing exogenous COUP-TF visible, preventing the normal StAR induction and steroid production elicited by the hormone.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In addition, COUP-TF is certainly not the sole regulator of StAR expression, and other factors, such as DAX-1 and SF-1 (14), most probably also contribute to basal StAR gene expression.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This finding is also in agreement with clinical observations showing that COUP-TFI and -II protein levels are markedly reduced in steroid-producing human adrenal tumors, as assessed by Western blot analysis (19), but contrasts with immunohistological observations indicating that COUP-TFII is highly expressed in nuclei of aldosteronoma cells (21).
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	187	 One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be found in the different methodologies used in these studies, as immunoblotting yields more quantitative measures than immunocytochemistry.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	188	Fourth, we have shown a direct physical interaction of COUP-TF with the proximal StAR promoter both in vitro and in vivo.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In EMSAs performed with a probe corresponding to a region of the proximal StAR promoter known to be critical in the control by SF-1 of StAR gene expression, the intensity of two bands was dramatically reduced by preincubation of the nuclear extracts with the anti-COUP-TF antibody.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	190	 This finding indicated that COUP-TF can interact either directly or indirectly with the StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Whether the two shifted bands represent complexes of COUP-TF with other proteins remains to be elucidated.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	192	Finally, ChIP assays allowed us to clearly demonstrate and quantify a direct binding of COUP-TF with the proximal StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The decrease in StAR promoter yield in the ChIP assay observed after AngII treatment matches exactly the repression of COUP-TF that we have observed, thus confirming that AngII lifts a direct repression exerted by COUP-TF on the StAR promoter.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	194	In summary, the data we have presented in this work indicates that the transcription factor COUP-TF, which is essentially known to play a developmental role in the adrenal cortex, is also implicated in modulating the differentiated function of adrenal glomerulosa cells, namely aldosterone biosynthesis.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Under basal conditions, COUP-TF exerts a tonic inhibition on steroidogenesis by repressing StAR protein expression, thus preventing cholesterol substrate supply to the mitochondria.
0.22347338.15375188.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Challenge of glomerulosa cells with physiological activators of mineralocorticoid production lifts this inhibition by reducing COUP-TF protein levels and COUP-TF binding to the StAR promoter, thus allowing the StAR protein to be expressed in higher amounts, intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer to occur and, eventually, aldosterone synthesis to proceed.

0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	277	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The expression of 2M in the rat ovary is dependent on the differentiation of granulosa cells to luteal cells (10, 11) as well as the presence, activation, and binding of a diverse set of transcription factors to the promoter of the 2M gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In this study we have identified and functionally characterized the interactions of two regions of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	279	 One region contains a PRLRE that is comprised of two Stat factor-binding sites and binds both Stat 5a and Stat 5b (Refs.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	280	 The other region contains an ORRE that binds the orphan nuclear receptors SF-1 (2, 3, 4) and COUP-TF (17, 18).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	281	 We show herein that maximal functional activity of the 2M promoter depends on the independent activation of each region by the binding and interactions of these specific transcription factors, hormonal stimulation, and a differentiated granulosa-luteal cell phenotype.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	282	When the studies described herein were originally initiated, we had shown that Stat 5a was expressed in rat granulosa cells, activated by PRL, and bound to the PRLRE of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We have extended these observations by showing that both Stat-binding sites are critical for PRL-induced activity of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Neither site alone in the context of the intact promoter exhibits significant functional activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	285	 These results indicate that the two sites may interact to stabilize or increase the binding of coregulatory molecules that interact with the transcriptional machinery.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	286	 As new information about the complexity of the Stat 5 family of transcription factors was reported (34, 35), reagents to these new family members allowed us to extend our initial observations.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Using antibodies specific for Stat 5b, we show that not only is it present in the rat granulosa cells, it is expressed at higher levels than Stat 5a, is activated by PRL, and binds to the PRLRE of the 2M gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	288	 These results obtained in granulosa-luteal cells in culture support those observed in luteal cells in vivo (10, 11).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Antibodies to Stat 5b have allowed us to document that in differentiated granulosa cells Stat 5b is tyrosine phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in response to PRL.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	290	 In addition, truncated, splice-variant forms of Stat proteins have been cloned.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	291	 For the Stats in which truncated forms have been identified, Stat 1 (36, 37) Stat 3 (38), and Stat 5 (25, 26), the mutants lacking the transactivation domain have been shown to exert dominant-negative functions in transcription assays (25, 26, 36, 37, 38).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	292	 When we coexpressed the truncated Stat 5b variant with the 2M promoter-luciferase reporter construct, PRL-induced activity was markedly impaired, supporting the hypothesis that Stat 5 is the major PRL-regulated activator of 2M promoter activity in the differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Taken together, our results provide evidence that PRL-mediated signaling events that transactivate the 2M gene in the granulosa-luteal cells occur by mechanisms similar to those that regulate cytokine signal transduction of target gene activity in other tissues, such as mammary gland (13, 39, 40) and liver (35, 41).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	294	 That Stat 5, especially Stat 5b, plays a major role in transducing PRL action in ovarian cells has been supported recently by the generation of mutant mice.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Although female mice null for Stat 5a do not exhibit an overt ovarian phenotype (42), mice null for Stat 5b alone (43) are infertile and exhibit abnormal ovarian functions.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Based on the luteal cell-specific expression of 2M in vivo as well as its regulation by PRL and Stat 5b in cultured cells, we predict that corpora lutea of the infertile mice either fail to express 2M or express it at a markedly reduced level.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	297	Our results have also provided new evidence to indicate that other regions, in addition to the PRLRE, regulate the expression of 2M in granulosa-luteal cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The region directly 3' of the PRLRE binds both SF-1 and COUP-TF and has been designated herein as the ORRE of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	299	 When this region of the 2M promoter was deleted, leaving the PRLRE intact, transgene activity was reduced to baseline and PRL inducibility was abolished.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Based on these initial observations, we predicted that Stat 5 binding to the PRLRE interacted synergistically with the orphan receptors binding to the 3'- regulatory region to confer maximal promoter activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This initial hypothesis was supported by observations of others who have shown that Stats synergistically interact with a variety of other transcription factors and coregulatory molecules.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	302	 In mammary epithelial cells, Stat 5 interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the ss-casein gene by PRL (23, 44).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	303	 In liver cells, Stat 3 synergizes (interacts) with glucocorticoid receptor for activation of the 2M gene by IL-6 (24).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Stat 1 and Sp1 interact to activate ICAM-I promoter in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (21).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In addition, Stat 2 has been shown to bind CBP/p300 and enhance gene activation by interferon- (20).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	306	 When site-specific mutations were generated in either the Stat 5, SF-1, or COUP-TF binding sites within the context of the intact 2M promoter, a different set of functional interactions was observed.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	307	Mutation of either one or both Stat 5-binding sites markedly reduced PRL inducibility.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	308	 As mentioned above, these results indicate that the functional activity of the PRLRE is dependent on the binding of Stat 5 to each site and that these two sites interact to confer maximal PRL inducibility.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	309	 However, mutation of the Stat sites did not alter the high basal activity observed with the intact 2M promoter-reporter constructs compared with the -48 2M minimal promoter construct.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Contrary to our initial hypothesis, these results indicated that the Stat sites acted independently of the factors binding to the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	311	 However, when site-specific mutations of the SF-1 site or the two COUP-TF binding sites were generated, marked changes in the basal activities of the mutant constructs were observed.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	312	 The mutant SF-1 construct that failed to bind SF-1 exhibited markedly reduced basal activity, whereas the COUP-TF mutant construct that failed to bind COUP-TF, but did bind SF-1, exhibited elevated basal activity.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	313	 These results indicated that SF-1 is a transcriptional activator and enhances 2M promoter activity, whereas COUP-TF acted as a corepressor to antagonize the activity of SF-1 and thereby reduce the functional activity of the intact 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Thus, the 2M gene can be added to a growing list of genes that are regulated by SF-1 in ovarian cells and highlights the importance of SF-1 in many diverse functions within the gonads and adrenals as suggested by the phenotype of mice null for SF-1 (1).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Furthermore, these observations provide the first evidence that COUP-TF is present and functional in ovarian granulosa cells and can regulate the expression of an ovarian gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Although the actions of COUP-TF are complex and have been shown to be both stimulatory and inhibitory (17), our data indicate that COUP-TF acts as a corepressor of SF-1 action in the intact promoter of the 2M gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	317	 This observation supports results obtained by one other study in which the effects of SF-1 were blunted by COUP-TF (5).
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	318	Although the mechanism by which COUP-TF blocks the actions of SF-1 on the 2M promoter have not been entirely defined, our data show an interesting juxtaposition and interaction of SF-1- and COUP-TF-binding sites.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Of note, mutation of the SF-1 site reduced by 10-fold the binding affinity of COUP-TF for the DR1 and DR2 regions of the 2M promoter.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	320	 From this, we conclude that the binding of COUP-TF to DR1 and DR2 overlaps the SF-1 site or adjacent sites.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	321	 However, despite the dramatic reduction in the binding affinity of COUP-TF to the SF-1 mutant region, COUP-TF retained potent repressor activity as revealed by the markedly reduced basal activity of the SF-1 mutant construct.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	322	 These interactions of SF-1 and COUP-TF indicate that any change in the relative levels or activity of these factors could markedly alter the basal activity of the 2M gene and thus its expression.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	323	Both PRLRE and ORRE are dependent on the differentiation of granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	324	 In the case of the PRLRE, granulosa cell differentiation is obligatory, in part, because of the increased expression of PRLRs on the cell surface.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Increased PRLR number enhances the activation of Stat 5b, which is constituitively expressed in the same amount in immature as well as differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	326	 In the case of the ORRE, the molecular basis for the enhanced activity of this region in differentiated cells, as opposed to immature cells, remains to be determined but likely involves altered functional activity and complex interactions of SF-1 or COUP-TF on the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	327	 As shown herein, the amounts and relative ratios of these two factors binding to the 2M ORRE are different in immature and differentiated granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	328	 There is a relative 6-fold increase in SF-1 binding in differentiated granulosa cells compared with the immature granulosa cells.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Therefore, increased basal activity of the 2M promoter may depend on the increased binding of this transcriptional activator.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	330	 In addition, functional changes are likely to involve the selective phosphorylation of either factor or a coregulatory molecule.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Phosphorylation of SF-1 would be predicted to increase activity of the ORRE, whereas phosphorylation of COUP-TF might decrease its repressor activity on the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The phosphorylation of either factor might alter the recruitment of other coregulatory molecules.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Phosphorylation of SF-1 has been shown to occur in differentiated granulosa cells (45) and, therefore, may be a critical event in increasing both basal activity of 2M as well as increasing the expression of PRLR.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	334	 In combination, these two events promote enhanced transcription of 2M by PRL.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	335	 As mentioned above, most cells do not express SF-1 but do express COUP-TF.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	336	 Therefore, it is possible that in these cells the repressor activity of COUP-TF is unopposed by any other transcription factor, thereby reducing expression of the gene.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	337	In summary, we have shown that expression of the 2M gene in ovarian granulosa-luteal cells involves not only PRL-induced activation of Stat 5b/a but also the opposing interactions of SF-1 and COUP-TF on an ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The close juxtaposition of these regions initially indicated that there might be a functional synergism between the factors binding to the PRLRE and the ORRE.
0.35218814.9731707.html.plaintext.txt	339	 However, using site-specific mutations, rather that deletion analyses, we have been able to show that these regions act independently of each other in the context of the intact 2M promoter.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates HNF4 and represses its transcriptional activity.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	8	 AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 had a 2-fold effect, reducing the ability of the transcription factor to form homodimers and bind DNA and increasing its degradation rate in vivo.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results demonstrate that HNF4 is a downstream target of AMPK and raise the possibility that one of the effects of AMPK activation is reduced expression of HNF4 target genes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The transcription factor HNF41 (NR2A1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a key role in regulating the expression of metabolic genes in multiple tissues including the liver, intestine, kidney, and endocrine pancreas (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In humans, a nonsense mutation in a single allele of the HNF4 gene causes an inherited form of diabetes known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) (for a review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This syndrome is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion (3, 4), indicating a significant defect in pancreatic function.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Surprisingly, there is not a major deficit in liver function, despite the important role of HNF4 in hepatic gene expression (5).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These observations suggest that HNF4 regulates pancreatic genes involved in glucose sensing and/or insulin production.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This hypothesis is supported by experiments demonstrating that HNF4 regulates expression of genes encoding enzymes of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (6 to 8).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Because MODY1 patients have a single null allele that does not produce a dominant-negative acting protein (9), the physiological abnormalities in these patients must be caused by a relatively mild (50%) decrease in the amount of HNF4 protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that any modification of HNF4 that causes a reduction in its transcriptional activity could have significant effects on pancreatic function.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	18	HNF4 has also been shown recently to play an important role in the regulation of hepatic glucose output, a key component of the maintenance of plasma glucose levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	19	 (10) recently demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of gene for the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by cAMP was mediated by the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1 acting through HNF4.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	20	 These findings suggest that HNF4 may play a role in the transcriptional response of the liver to metabolic hormones and that factors regulating the activity of HNF4 could have an effect on hepatic glucose output.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	21	AMPK is the mammalian homolog of the yeast SNF1 protein kinase (11).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In yeast, the SNF1 complex is a nuclear protein that regulates expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and is activated by phosphorylation when glucose is removed from the growth medium (12).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In mammalian cells, AMPK acts as a fuel sensor that monitors AMP and ATP levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It is activated by high AMP:ATP ratios during states of low energy charge.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Once activated, the enzyme reduces the activity of ATP-consuming anabolic pathways and increases the activity of catabolic ATP-producing pathways, acting to reestablish normal cellular energy balance (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Depending on the tissue, a variety of physiological circumstances can cause AMPK activation including hypoglycemia (14), ischemia (15), heat shock (16), and exercise (17 to 19).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	27	 AMPK activation has been associated with several key aspects of metabolism including exercise-induced glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in muscle (17, 20, 21), reduced lipid (22, 23) and glucose synthesis in liver (12, 24), and altered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the endocrine pancreas (14, 25).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	28	AMPK is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit and two non-catalytic and subunits (26, 27) that exist in multiple isoforms (28 to 30).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Kinase activity is regulated allosterically by AMP binding and also by direct phosphorylation mediated by an uncharacterized AMP-sensitive protein kinase.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	30	 A potential role of AMPK in the nucleus is suggested by several observations.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The first is the similarity of the mammalian kinase to the yeast SNF1 transcriptional regulator, as described above.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Second, AMPK heterotrimers containing the 2 subunit isoform are preferentially found in the nucleus (31).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, AMPK has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300 and to regulate its ability to mediate nuclear receptor transcriptional activity (32).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	34	It has been reported previously (33) that AMPK activation reduces HNF4 target gene transcription.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These findings, together with the fact that both proteins participate in the regulation of similar metabolic pathways, raise the possibility that HNF4 is directly regulated by AMPK.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The experiments described here examine the possibility that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4 and regulates its transcriptional activity.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	159	 To explore the possibility that these effects are due to direct regulation of HNF4 by AMPK, we tested whether AMPK could phosphorylate HNF4.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	160	 An in vitro phosphorylation assay containing full-length HNF4 and partially purified AMPK was carried out.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	161	 1A) demonstrate that HNF4 was efficiently phosphorylated by AMPK, showing approximately the same degree of phosphorylation as a similar amount of the well characterized AMPK substrate hormone-sensitive lipase.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	162	Mapping AMPK Phosphorylation Site on HNF4 When the HNF4 amino acid sequence was screened for the consensus target sequence for AMPK phosphorylation, three potential sites were found (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	163	 1B) with the best match to a site surrounding serine 304.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	164	 To determine whether any of these sites were targets for AMPK phosphorylation, they were each mutated to alanine and examined in an in vitro phosphorylation assay.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	165	 None of the mutants abolished phosphorylation by AMPK (data not shown), indicating that there are multiple AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	166	 To examine phosphorylation of individual segments of the protein independently, four overlapping fragments of HNF4 were generated from subclones of the HNF4 cDNA (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	167	 When in vitro AMPK assays were conducted, all four subfragments were phosphorylated to some degree (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	168	 1D) and showed the expected enhancement of phosphorylation in the presence of AMP (an allosteric activator of the kinase).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	169	 However, when the results were normalized to the total amount of protein in the assay, the HNF4/C fragment (containing the Ser-304 site) showed the highest degree of AMP-dependent phosphorylation (data not shown).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	170	 A significant amount of phosphorylation was also observed with the HNF4/A fragment.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The HNF4/A fragment contains one of the three potential consensus sites for AMPK (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	172	 However, mutation of threonine 15 to alanine in this sequence did not reduce the phosphorylation of the HNF4/A fragment, suggesting the presence of one or more cryptic AMPK sites in this part of the protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	173	To determine whether the C fragment is phosphorylated at the Ser-304 residue, the S304A mutant was transferred to the C fragment and examined in an in vitro phosphorylation assay.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	174	 2A, mutation of serine 304 completely abolished phosphorylation of the C fragment.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Although the Ser-304 site is also present in the D fragment (Fig 1C), it does not appear to be a good substrate for the kinase in this context as this fragment is phosphorylated to a much lower degree than the C fragment (Fig.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Together, these results suggest that S304A is a phosphorylation site for AMPK in vitro and that additional sites are present in both the N and C termini of protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	178	In vivo, HNF4 is a phosphoprotein and is a substrate for multiple kinases (36, 37).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	179	 To explore the phosphorylation of HNF4 by AMPK in vivo, wild-type and S304A versions of the HNF4/C fragment were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This phosphorylation was completely absent when the S304A version of the fragment was used, indicating that Ser-304 is phosphorylated in vivo by AMPK.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In vivo phosphorylation experiments using the full-length HNF4 protein showed the same degree of phosphorylation for the wild-type and Ser-304 mutant protein (data not shown).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This may be due to a combination of high basal phosphorylation of HNF4 by multiple kinases in vivo (36, 37) and the likelihood that there are additional AMPK phosphorylation sites on HNF4 (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	186	Functional Effects of HNF4 Phosphorylation To explore potential functional effects of phosphorylation of HNF4 at serine 304, an aspartic acid residue was introduced at this site by in vitro mutagenesis to generate a charge mimic of the phosphoserine residue.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The effect of phosphorylation at Ser-304 on the ability of HNF4 to form functional homodimers and bind to DNA was examined in a gel mobility shift assay with wild-type and the phosphomimetic S304D versions of HNF4 proteins synthesized by in vitro translation.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Both the wild-type and S304A version of HNF4 bound to an HNF4-response element derived from the human apoCIII promoter (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, the S304D mutant HNF4 showed a dramatically reduced ability to bind to DNA despite similar amounts of protein present in the reaction (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Gel mobility shift experiments using HNF4 protein that was phosphorylated by AMPK in vitro showed only a mild reduction in DNA binding activity (data not shown).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The effect of phosphorylation on the ability of HNF4 to bind DNA would be less pronounced than the S304D mutation if less than 100% of the HNF4 protein is phosphorylated in the in vitro kinase reaction.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Although the efficiency of these reactions is unknown, it is likely that only a fraction of the HNF4 molecules become phosphorylated at Ser-304 leaving the non-phosphorylated protein free to form dimers and bind DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In addition, it is also possible that dimers composed of one phosphorylated and one non-phosphorylated HNF4 molecule are competent to bind DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	194	Because HNF4 binds DNA as a homodimer, the defective DNA binding of the S304D mutant could be due either to reduced dimer formation or to a diminished affinity of mutant dimers for DNA.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	195	 To examine directly the effect of the mutant on dimerization, in the absence of DNA, an in vitro association assay using 35S-labeled HNF4 monomers of different sizes was carried out.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	196	 A fusion protein of GST and wild-type HNF4 (protein size 78 kDa) was co-translated with either wild-type or mutant full-length HNF4 protein (52 kDa).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The GST-HNF4 fusion protein was purified out of the reaction with a glutathione resin together with dimerized 52-kDa wild-type or mutant HNF4.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	198	 3B) demonstrated that wild-type and S304A HNF4 readily formed dimers with the wild-type GST-HNF4 protein (arrow, lanes 1 and 2).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In contrast, the S304D protein showed a reduced ability to interact with the wild-type GST-HNF4 (compare lane 3 to lanes 1 and 2).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Densitometry analysis of the Western blot demonstrated that the lower input amount of S304D protein (lane 6) did not account for the reduction in the amount of S304D bound to wild-type GST-HNF4 protein (data not shown).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	201	To examine further the ability of dimers composed of one unphosphorylated monomer and one phosphorylated monomer to form and bind to DNA, wild-type and S304D mutant HNF4 proteins of different sizes were mixed together and the resulting dimers analyzed by gel mobility shift.

0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	203	 3C, compare lane 6 to lanes 3 and 9).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	204	 3A, homodimers of S304D HNF4 failed to form (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	205	 3C, compare lane 4 to lanes 1 and 7).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in vitro, a negative charge on serine 304 inhibits dimer formation and that the effect is more pronounced when both monomers contain the additional negative charge.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	207	To examine the effects of Ser-304 phosphorylation on dimer formation and DNA binding in vivo, wild-type, S304A, and S304D expression constructs were transfected into CHO cells (which have very low amounts of endogenous HNF4).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	208	 After transfection, AMPK was activated by AICAR treatment, and nuclear extracts were prepared for gel mobility shift assays.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	209	 As observed in vitro the S304D phosphomimetic mutant showed reduced DNA binding activity (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	210	 In addition there is a mild reduction in DNA binding of the wild-type protein upon AICAR treatment (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	211	 3D, compare lanes 4 and 5) that did not occur in the phosphorylation-defective S304A protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, much of this reduction in DNA binding activity correlates with changes in the amount of HNF4 present in the various transfections (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	213	 For example, the amount of S304D protein is significantly lower than the wild-type protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	214	 3D, compare lane 8 to lane 4, lower panel).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Likewise, the amount of wild-type HNF4 is reduced after AMPK activation (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	216	 3D, compare lanes 4 and 5, lower panel).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The reduction of HNF4 amounts after AICAR treatment did not occur with the phosphorylation-defective S304A mutation (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	218	 3D, compare lanes 6 and 7, lower panel) suggesting that the effect is due to phosphorylation at serine 304.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	219	 These changes in HNF4 protein amounts suggest that addition of a negative charge to serine 304 reduces the stability of the HNF4 protein in these cells.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	220	Potential effects of AMPK activation on HNF4 protein stability were further explored by examining the appearance of proteolytic products of wild-type and mutant HNF4 proteins in transiently transfected CHO cells treated with AICAR.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Western blot analysis shows that in the absence of AICAR detectable amounts of degradation fragments appear in only lysates from cells transfected with the phosphomimetic S304D HNF4 (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The activation of AMPK by AICAR addition induced the appearance of degradation fragments from the wild-type but not the phosphorylation-defective S304A protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These findings indicate that phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 increased the proteolytic degradation of the protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	224	 In addition, these results strongly support the conclusion that AMPK phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 in vivo.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	225	 To measure the rate of degradation of wild-type and mutant HNF4 proteins, a tetracycline-regulated expression system was used to transiently express wild-type and 304 mutant HNF4 in transfected CHO cells.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	226	 18 h post-transfection, HNF4 expression was specifically extinguished by the addition of doxycycline, and the amount of HNF4 protein remaining in the cells was determined at regular intervals over the following 8 h.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	227	 4, B and C) demonstrate that the phosphomimetic S304D mutant protein was degraded more rapidly then either the wild-type or S304A proteins.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that phosphorylation of HNF4 at Ser-304 has two effects on HNF4: to reduce its ability to form functional dimers, and to reduce the stability of HNF4 in vivo.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	229	The HNF4 dimerization and DNA binding results presented above predict that the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304 would have a negative effect on its transcriptional activity.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	230	 To determine whether this is the case, plasmids expressing wild-type and Ser-304 mutant proteins were transfected into CHO cells together with an HNF4-responsive reporter plasmid.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	231	 As predicted from the DNA binding studies, the S304D mutant showed significantly less transcriptional activity than the wild-type HNF4 protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The S304A mutant was slightly more active than the wild-type protein suggesting the possibility that there is a basal level of phosphorylation that reduces the activity of the wild-type protein.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	233	 These results indicate AMPK-negative regulates HNF4 activity by phosphorylation of serine 304 and suggest that AMPK activity could influence the expression of HNF4 target genes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	234	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Here we report that the transcription factor HNF4 is a novel substrate of AMP-activated protein kinase.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Given the central role of AMPK in mediating the response to changes in cellular energy balance and the fact that HNF4 regulates genes involved in energy metabolism, these findings suggest a mechanism for how the expression of a specific set of metabolic genes might be linked to cellular energy status.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Although we have not directly demonstrated that AMPK regulates HNF4-mediated gene expression in vivo, a previous study reported that activation of AMPK activity in primary liver cells correlated with reduced expression of HNF4 target genes (33).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Our findings offer a potential mechanistic explanation for the relationship between HNF4 target gene down-regulation and AMPK activation.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	238	 The kinase phosphorylates HNF4 on serine 304 (Figs.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	239	 1 and 2), which causes a reduction in the ability of HNF4 to form dimers and bind DNA (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	240	 In vivo, addition of a negative charge to this residue, by substitution with an aspartic acid residue, reduced the ability of HNF4 to activate transcription from a cotransfected HNF4-dependent reporter (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	241	In addition to the effects on HNF4 dimerization and DNA binding, phosphorylation of HNF4 on Ser-304, or conversion of Ser-304 to an aspartic acid, also caused an increase in the degradation rate and a reduction in the amount of HNF4 protein (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that activation of AMPK in primary hepatocytes resulted in a reduction in the amount of endogenous HNF4 (33).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Taken together, our findings suggest a model in which one of the branches of the AMPK signaling pathway results in the phosphorylation of HNF4 on serine 304, leading to both a reduction in the amount and activity of HNF4 and a subsequent reduction in the expression of HNF4 target genes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	244	Although the work reported here is focused on the phosphorylation of the serine 304 residue in HNF4, it is clear that this is not the only site on HNF4 that is phosphorylated by AMPK.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The HNF4/A fragment from the N-terminal half of the protein was strongly phosphorylated in vitro on a site that we were not able to map.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	246	 This site (or sites) may be responsible for the remaining phosphorylation of the full-length protein that occurs when the Ser-304 residue is mutated to alanine (Fig.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We are currently mapping the AMPK site in the N terminus of HNF4 so that we can determine their functional significance.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In addition to the regulation of HNF4 activity that we describe here, it has been reported previously that HNF4 DNA binding activity is repressed by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of residues in the DNA binding domain (37).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	249	 It has also been reported that phosphorylation of HNF4 on tyrosine residues affected its transcriptional activity and sub-nuclear localization (39).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	250	 These findings, together with those reported here, suggest that that HNF4 is a highly regulated transcription factor and that multiple signaling pathways influence its activity.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	251	An interesting question concerning the phosphorylation of HNF4 by AMPK in vivo is the cellular location in which it occurs.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	252	 HNF4 is strongly associated with the nucleus, whereas most of the known AMPK substrates are cytoplasmic enzymes.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Although it is possible that HNF4 is also phosphorylated by in the cytoplasm, the most appealing compartment for the interaction would be the nucleus.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Several observations support this possibility.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	255	 First, specific isoforms of the kinase have been reported to be present in the nucleus (31, 40).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Second, other transcriptional components have been reported to be potential substrates of the kinase; the co-activator p300 (32) and the carbohydrate-response transcription factor ChREBP (41).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Finally, the yeast homolog of mammalian AMPK, SNF-1, is present in the nucleus (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	258	 13) and is associated with chromatin, possibly in a gene-specific pattern (42).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Together these observations suggest the intriguing possibility that at least some version of mammalian AMPK may be a component of the transcriptional complex on specific genes that are regulated by cellular energy balance.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	260	What would be the physiological outcome of reduced HNF4 target gene expression? The answer to this question depends on the tissue being considered.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In the endocrine pancreas, reduction of HNF4 activity would be predicted to have significant effect on the ability of the islet to secrete the appropriate amount of insulin.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	262	 This possibility is illustrated by the phenotype of MODY1 patients who have only one normal allele of the HNF4 gene and presumably a reduced amount of active HNF4 protein (3).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	263	 These patients have a defective insulin secretion in response that appears to be a primary effect of reduced HNF4 levels in pancreatic -cells (4, 43).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Consistent with the apparent role of HNF4 in pancreatic physiology are the observations that HNF4 regulates a variety of -cell genes involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion (6 to 8).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	265	Like HNF4, AMPK also clearly plays a role in the physiology of the endocrine pancreas.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	266	 It is likely that the -cell senses glucose concentration as fluctuations in the amount of intracellular ATP generated by glucose oxidation.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The insulin secretory machinery gauges the amount of insulin to secrete by sensing these ATP level fluctuations (for review see Ref.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It is possible that the changes in cellular energy balance in -cells that occur in normal physiology have an effect on HNF4 phosphorylation and activity and that fluctuation in HNF4 activity are part of the normal physiological regulation of the islet.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Consistent with this possibility is the observation that low glucose levels induce AMPK activity in cell lines derived from pancreatic -cells and the suggestion that changes in kinase activity are involved in insulin secretion (25).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Alternatively, it is possible that AMPK-mediated changes in HNF4 activity are relevant in pathological conditions where AMPK is aberrantly activated and HNF4 activity is suppressed below normal levels.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	271	 This situation could potentially result in a physiological circumstance analogous to the MODY1 phenotype.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	272	Another tissue where AMPK-mediated changes in HNF4 target gene expression could have a significant metabolic effect is the liver.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	273	 It has been understood for many years that HNF4 plays an important role in the liver, regulating genes involved in lipid (45), amino acid (46, 47), and glucose metabolism (48, 49) and the coagulation cascade (50).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	274	 It has been reported recently that HNF4 plays a key role in the induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis by mediating the transcriptional effects of the co-activator PGC1 (10).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	275	 On the other hand, the reduction of HNF4 levels due to haploinsufficiency in MODY1 patients did not cause major liver abnormalities (5, 51), although changes in amounts of some liver-derived serum proteins were observed (52).
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	276	It is clear that an AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of HNF4 could potentially have important effects on liver and pancreatic islet physiology.
0.297294.12740371.html.plaintext.txt	277	 We are currently examining HNF4 phosphorylation in hepatic and pancreatic cell lines to determine whether AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-304 occurs under more physiological conditions and to ascertain the potential metabolic role of the phosphorylation events described here.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	4	The DNA-bending protein TF1 is the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1-encoded homolog of the bacterial HU proteins and the Escherichia coli integration host factor.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We recently proposed that TF1, which binds with high affinity (Kd was ~3 nM) to preferred sites within the hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)-containing phage genome, identifies its binding sites based on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here, we show that two hmU-A base pair steps coinciding with two previously proposed sites of DNA distortion are critical for complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The affinity of TF1 is reduced 10-fold when both of these hmU-A base pair steps are replaced with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps; only modest changes in affinity result when substitutions are made at other base pairs of the TF1 binding site.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Replacement of all hmU residues with thymine decreases the affinity of TF1 greatly; remarkably, the high affinity is restored when the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to previously suggested sites of distortion are reintroduced into otherwise T-containing DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	9	 T-DNA constructs with 3-base bulges spaced apart by 9 base pairs of duplex also generate nM affinity of TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We suggest that twin hmU-A base pair steps located at the proposed sites of distortion are key to target site selection by TF1 and that recognition is based largely, if not entirely, on sequence-dependent DNA flexibility.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	11	The genome of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1 contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU)1 in place of thymine, and discrimination between T- and hmU-containing DNA is important during phage multiplication (1, 2).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	12	 For one phage-encoded protein, the DNA-binding and -bending protein TF1, this discrimination is essentially absolute: the high affinity of TF1 (Kd order of magnitude nM) for preferred sites within the hmU-containing phage genome is greatly reduced for the corresponding T-containing DNA (3, 4).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We recently showed that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is matched in T-containing DNA constructs that contain sets of two consecutive mismatches separated by 9 bp of duplex, indicating that hmU-content and appropriately placed flexible loops contribute similarly to complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We proposed, therefore, that DNA in a complex with TF1 is distorted at two sites that are separated by 9 bp of duplex DNA, sites corresponding to two hmU-A base pair steps, and that TF1 identifies its target sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexibility (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Here we examine the requirement for hmU residues across a 37-mer DNA duplex representing a preferred binding site within the phage genome (4) and specifically evaluate sequence requirements at the two inferred sites of DNA distortion.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	16	TF1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli DL39 (6) and purified as described (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Oligonucleotides with hmU content were synthesized as described (7) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	18	 T-containing oligonucleotides were purchased and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The top strand (shared among bulge constructs) was 32P-labeled at the 5-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Complementary oligonucleotides were mixed at equimolar concentrations, heated to 90  degrees C, and slowly cooled to 4  degrees C over several hours to form duplex DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	21	Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were carried out as described (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Experiments with perfect duplex hmU- or hybrid T/hmU-DNA were done at room temperature unless noted otherwise.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Experiments with bulge constructs were performed at 4  degrees C to prevent dissociation of duplexes.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	24	 After electrophoresis, gels were dried and protein-DNA complexes were quantified using phosphorimaging.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	25	 DNA migrating between bands corresponding to free and complexed DNA was considered as free DNA (5) in calculating equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Values of Kd are reported as the average of at least three experiments  plus or minus  S.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (for closely related DNA constructs yielding suboptimal complex formation, triplicate determinations were deemed unnecessary).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	28	The sequence of a 37-mer DNA construct corresponding to a preferred binding site within the phage SPO1 genome (4) is shown in Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Because of the ability of TF1 to form nested complexes on longer DNA fragments, the length of the DNA constructs was chosen to accommodate only one TF1 dimer (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The affinity of TF1 for the 37-mer hmU-containing duplex (Kd was ~3 nM; Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	31	 1A) was reduced 10-fold upon replacement of the two hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to the potential sites of distortion with A-hmU, G-C, or C-G steps (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Altering the sequence at the center of the binding site (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	33	 1 and 2, panels C) or on the flanks, distal to the proposed sites of bending (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	34	 1 and 2, panels D), did not significantly affect complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The observed sequence specificity at proposed sites of distortion is consistent with a direct participation of hmU-A base pair steps in complex formation and DNA bending.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	38	 B, a 10-fold reduction in affinity is associated with replacement of target hmU-A steps.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Substitutions on the flanks target additional hmU-A base pair steps; additional substitutions were required to prevent introduction of new hmU-A steps.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Top strands shown were annealed to complementary hmU-containing bottom strands to generate perfect duplexes.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Altering the central base pairs (GC-rich; panel C) or the sequence distal to proposed sites of DNA distortion (wild-type (wt) + GC; panel D) has little effect on complex formation.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	49	To evaluate the contribution of hmU residues to the DNA binding affinity of TF1, DNA constructs were designed in which central hmU-containing blocks of 13 or 11 bp, encompassing the proposed sites of DNA distortion (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	50	 3, constructs Th2 and Th3), or of 9 or 7 bp, excluding hmU-A steps that are candidate sites of specific distortion (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	51	 3, constructs Th4 and Th5), were embedded in T-containing surrounding sequence.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Constructs in which the proposed sites of distortion lie within the hmU-containing blocks (Th2 and Th3) yielded Kd = 5-6 nM compared with 3 nM for all-hmU-DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	53	 A more than 5-fold reduction in affinity was observed for DNA with shorter hmU-containing blocks (Th4 and Th5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	54	 A DNA duplex in which a central 13-bp T-containing block is flanked by hmU-containing sequence (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	55	 3, construct Th1) bound TF1 with 10-fold lower affinity relative to all-hmU-DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	56	 DNA duplexes with T or hmU content.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Blocks of hmU content are underlined.

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	61	For DNA with 2 4-bp hmU-containing blocks, a significantly lower affinity was observed for DNA constructs with T-A base pair steps at the proposed sites of bending (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	62	 3, constructs Th8 and Th9) than for otherwise identical constructs with hmU-A base pair steps (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	63	 3, constructs Th6 and Th7; Kd was ~5 nM).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Remarkably, TF1 was found to have essentially undiminished affinity for DNA in which the two hmU-A base pair steps are completely surrounded by T-containing DNA (Kd = 4 nM; Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	65	 We note also that the affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA and for the Th7/Th6 construct was the same at room temperature and at 4  degrees C (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	66	 A 7-10-fold reduction in affinity was observed if only one strand contained the requisite hmU-A sequence (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	67	 3, constructs Th7/T and T/Th6, and Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Our interpretation of these observations is that hmU content affords an increased flexibility that is recognized by TF1 and that hmU-A base pair steps symmetrically disposed about the center of the binding site are targets for specific distortion in the protein-DNA complex.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Twin hmU-A base pair steps corresponding to presumptive sites of distortion are required for complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA (A) is reproduced by a DNA construct in which target hmU-A base pair steps are surrounded by T-DNA (Th7/6 in B).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Constructs in which only one strand contains the hmU-A sequence have 10-fold lower affinity (Th7/T in C).

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The nM affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA is reproduced by T-DNA with base bulges separated by 9 bp of duplex.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The affinity of TF1 for perfect duplex hmU-DNA is reproduced by T-DNA with a set of 4-nt loops (A).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	75	 1- or 2-base bulges (lowercase c, underlined) in combination with a mismatch reproduce the nM affinity for TF1 (B), as do 2- or 3-base bulges (C).

0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	79	The high affinity of TF1 for hmU-DNA (Kd was ~3 nM) was reproduced in T-DNA that contains two appropriately positioned flexible sites generated by sets of tandem mismatches (Ref.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Improved complex formation relative to perfect duplex T-DNA would also be expected for T-DNA constructs in which the energetic cost of bending is lessened through the incorporation of bulge-loops, i.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	81	 with nucleotides that are formally unopposed on the complementary strand (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Constructs with sets of 1- or 2-nt bulges combined with one mismatched base pair positioned 9 bp apart indeed generated high affinity for TF1 (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	83	 5B); note that sets of 2-nt loops (one mismatch) generated suboptimal binding compared with sets of 4-nt loops (two consecutive mismatches).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The high affinity of TF1 was fully restored for DNA constructs with sets of 2- or 3-nt bulges with suboptimal binding for DNA with a pair of 1-nt bulges (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Replacing the T-containing top strand of bulge constructs with the corresponding hmU-containing strand did not affect complex formation (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Bulge-loops are considered to generate directed kinks in the helix axis (8, 9).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Consistent with the presence of such kinks, we observed a reduction in electrophoretic mobility of bulged DNA constructs, the magnitude of which depended on the size of the bulge (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The mobility of protein-DNA complexes was similar irrespective of the nature of the DNA construct.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	89	The TF1 double mutant protein TF1 (E15G/T32I) binds DNA with ~40-fold higher affinity than does wild-type TF1 (10) due to interactions outside the central 25-bp region of the binding site (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The presence of bulge-loops in T-DNA affected the affinity of TF1 (E15G/T32I) and wild-type TF1 in similar ways, consistent with unaltered interactions for the mutant protein with a central DNA segment that includes proposed sites of bending (data not shown).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	91	The structure of TF1 reveals the presence of flexible -ribbon arms that are directly involved in DNA binding (11),2 as does the structure of the closely related HU protein (12, 13) and the recently reported structure of integration host factor (IHF) in a complex with DNA (14).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	92	 At the tip of the DNA-binding arms, TF1 contains a Phe residue at position 61 in place of the Arg found in all other members of this protein family.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	93	 TF1(F61R) has reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15) but was seen to retain high affinity for hmU-DNA (Kd = 9.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Substituting Phe-61 with Tyr had little effect on affinity (Kd = 6.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Replacing Phe-61 with a polar, uncharged residue (Ser or Gln) significantly reduces both DNA binding affinity and site-selectivity (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Notably, the affinity for hmU-DNA of both TF1(F61S) (Kd = 236  plus or minus  19 nM) and TF1(F61Q) (Kd = 685  plus or minus  48 nM) increased more than 5-fold for T-DNA with 2 3-base bulges (Kd = 36  plus or minus  2 and 90  plus or minus  7 nM, respectively; Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This is in contrast to wild-type TF1 that bound hmU-DNA and bulge-DNA constructs (1+2, 1+3, 0+2, and 0+3) with approximately the same affinity (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	98	 T-DNA with sets of 4-nt loops, which also reproduces the affinity of wild-type TF1 for hmU-DNA (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	99	 5), did not significantly enhance complex formation by TF1(F61S) (Kd was ~200 nM) or TF1(F61Q) (Kd was ~570 nM) beyond that observed with hmU-DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Apparently hmU content and flexible loops in T-DNA contribute similarly to complex formation for these TF1 mutant proteins, which are deficient in binding and bending of hmU-DNA (15, 16), whereas DNA with a static kink generates an increase in affinity.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	101	Our previous conjecture that TF1 principally identifies its preferred binding sites through recognition of sequence-dependent DNA flexure was based on an analysis of affinities for DNA constructs with sets of 4-nt loops (5).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	102	 For this mode of target site selection, the prediction would be for the sequence at the sites of distortion to significantly affect complex formation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	103	 This prediction appears to be borne out both in terms of preferred base pair steps in the context of hmU-DNA (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	104	 1 and 2) but particularly by the significant effect of hmU-A base pair steps in a T-containing surrounding sequence (Figs.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	105	 We propose that hmU content confers a site-specific flexibility on the DNA duplex that is recognized by TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	106	 hmU-A base pair steps that are situated at presumptive sites of DNA bending make the principal contributions to complex formation with TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	107	 hmU residues at other positions that generate measurable, yet suboptimal affinities, presumably do so either due to longer range effects on DNA flexure or because of alternative placement of TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	108	 An effect of hmU residues on the deformability of the double helix is corroborated by the increased affinity observed for other members of the family of type II DNA-binding proteins, HU and IHF, and for the unrelated eukaryotic protein, HMG1 (17).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Changes in complex formation by both major and minor groove-binding proteins and antibiotics induced by introduction of other modified bases have also been interpreted in terms of effects on DNA deformability by exocyclic substituents (18-20).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	110	Inferences about increased flexure of DNA containing modified bases stress the need for analysis of the associated structures and conformational energetics.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Structural nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of an A-hmU base pair flanked by G-C base pairs indicates no significant deviations from classical B-form DNA (21), although nearest neighbors do influence the structure (22).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	112	 13C or 31P nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments may provide the required insights into the dynamics of duplex DNA the size of a protein binding site, features that are only poorly extractable from measurements using techniques such as fluorescence polarization and DNA cyclization (23, 24).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The suggested locations of DNA bends in the TF1 DNA complex coincide with two hmU-A base pair steps.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Considering the unique properties of the T-A step in terms of diversity of structure (25, 26), it would be of particular interest to determine whether the inherent deformability of the T-A step is accentuated in hmU-A.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	115	For a protein that bends DNA through a large angle (16), it is not surprising to find a greater affinity for DNA whose axis is kinked by unpaired bases (Fig.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Indeed, similar results have been previously reported for HU (27).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	117	 We note that T-DNA constructs with pairs of suitably placed 4-nt loops or 3-nt bulge-loops generate the same affinity for wild-type TF1.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, different structures and energetics of deformation are indicated by the significantly higher affinity for bulge constructs of the TF1 mutant proteins TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q), which are impaired in DNA binding and bending.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	119	 These observations are consistent with a static kink introduced by bulge-loops compared with a looser more flexible structure imposed by symmetric loops (8, 9, 24, 28); we suggest that pre-bent DNA bulge-loop constructs also permit complex formation with certain TF1 mutant proteins, whereas binding and bending of DNA with sets of 4-nt loops (or hmU content) require a protein-mediated introduction and stabilization of DNA kinks.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	120	Replacement of Phe-61 at the tip of DNA-binding arms with a polar, uncharged residue may render TF1 mutant proteins either incapable of producing specific DNA kinks, a process which would be aided locally by the presence of DNA bulge-loops, or deficient in securing the resulting DNA conformation, demands on which would be lessened in DNA with a predisposed orientation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	121	 If TF1, like IHF, employs a totally conserved Pro residue to intercalate between specific base pairs of the binding site (14), then the deficiency of TF1(F61S) and TF1(F61Q) in DNA binding and bending may reside in their inability to stabilize a severely bent DNA conformation.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Phe-61 contributes to the striking preference of TF1 for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	123	 TF1(F61R) also has high affinity for hmU-DNA but a reduced preference for hmU-DNA over T-DNA (15).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In addition, IHF (which has higher affinity for a specific binding site in hmU-DNA compared with T-DNA (17)) relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sites (14).
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	125	 If TF1 and IHF engage their DNA targets in an isomorphous fashion, the preference for hmU-DNA characteristic of TF1 may not be due to specific interactions between Phe-61 and hmU residues of the TF1 binding site.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Rather, the inability of TF1 to stabilize a T-DNA duplex that is severely kinked through intercalation of Pro residues may be alleviated by the more pliable hmU-DNA.
0.23938537.9148920.html.plaintext.txt	127	 On the other hand, the possibility that TF1 does use Phe-61 directly for inducing DNA kinks at two hmU-A base pair steps remains to be established or disproved by direct structure determination.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	4	The cholesterol 7-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A) is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including hormones, bile acids, and diurnal rhythm.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Previous studies have identified a region from nucleotides (nt) 74 to 55 of the rat CYP7A promoter that enhanced bile acid repression of the SV40 early promoter, as assayed with a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HepG2 cells.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The rat CYP7A promoter/reporter activity was strongly stimulated by cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the nuclear hormone receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in a dose-dependent manner.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Site-directed mutagenesis in the region of nt 74 to 55 altered this stimulation.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recombinant COUP-TFII expressed in HepG2 or COS-1 cells were found to bind to nt 74 55 and nt 149 128 probes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and by supershifting the corresponding band with COUP-TFII-specific antibodies.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The region of nt 176 117 was previously mapped as a retinoic acid response region and was found to bind retinoid X receptor (RXR).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	10	 EMSA supershift assays of wild-type and mutant oligomers using antibody against RXR revealed that the sequences between nt 145 and 134 were important for RXR binding.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We conclude that COUP-TFII stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rat CYP7A promoter by binding to the sequences between nt 74 to 54 and nt 149 to 128.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	12	 RXR may stimulate CYP7A gene transcription by binding to a direct repeat of the hormone response element separated by one nucleotide located at nt 146 134.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	13	Cholesterol 7-hydroxylase (EC 1.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	14	17) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in a pathway that converts cholesterol to bile acids.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver is the main mechanism for elimination of cholesterol from the body and thus plays an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis (1).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The gene CYP7A is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including bile acids, cholesterol, hormones, and circadian rhythm (2-6).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	17	The CYP7A promoter structure is typical of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II promoter in that, upstream of the TATA box, there are several cis-acting elements that regulate the transcriptional activity of this promoter (7-9).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Transient transfection assay of chimeric CYP7A promoter/luciferase constructs in HepG2 cells revealed that the region from nt 416 to +32 of the rat CYP7A gene contained the promoter and regulatory domains conferring the activation of transcription by dexamethasone and retinoic acid and suppression by bile acids, phorbol esters, and insulin (2, 3, 9, 10).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We have mapped two footprints that are protected from DNase I digestion using rat liver nuclear extracts (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Footprint (Fp)1 A is located between nt 81 and 35, and FpB is located between nt 148 and 129.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Nucleotide sequences in these two regions are highly conserved among homologous CYP7A genes of different species.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These footprints contain liver-enriched transcription factors binding sites and hormone response elements.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A putative bile acid response element (BARE) was mapped to the FpA region, which lead us to propose that a bile acid responsive nuclear receptor may be mediating bile acid response (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	24	The molecular mechanism of bile acid repression is still unknown.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Determining what factors interact with these BARE sequences is a first step in elucidating the nature of the bile acid response.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	26	 A nuclear protein factor, which was found to bind a repeated sequence -65TCAAGTTCAAG-54 was named direct repeat binding protein (DRBP).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Binding of DRBP to BARE was diminished when liver nuclear extract prepared from rats fed deoxycholate was used in EMSA (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The sequence from nt 73 to 57 contains an imperfect direct repeat of the hormone response element (HRE, AGGTCA) separated by four nucleotides (DR4).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	29	 According to the 3-4-5 rule for the binding specificity of the steroid/thyroid hormone family of transcription factors (12), a DR4 would be predicted to act as a thyroid hormone response element, hence "7TRE" as the tentative name for this DR4 sequence (11).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, CYP7A promoter constructs containing these sequences did not respond to thyroid hormones in HepG2 cells (2).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	31	 A number of nuclear factors have affinity for DR4 sequences, including TR, XONR, and LXR that form heterodimers with RXR (13, 14).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	32	 COUP-TFII (or ARP-1) of orphan nuclear receptor family with promiscuous binding specificities also bind a DR4 sequence (15, 16).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	33	 COUP-TFs are believed to influence developmental changes, which is supported by the report that the COUP-TFII promoter responds to differentiation signal, retinoic acid (17).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recently, we have mapped a complex retinoic acid response region located between 176 and 117 of the rat CYP7A promoter (10).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	35	Using transient transfection assay of CYP7A promoter/reporter activity in HepG2 cells, we have screened a number of known steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors for their effects on gene transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	36	 COUP-TFII produced one of the strongest effects on transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Here, we provide evidence that orphan receptor COUP-TFII activates transcription of rat CYP7A by binding to nt 74 to 54 and to nt 149 to 128 and that an RXR homodimer may bind to a DR1 motif between 146 to 134.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The increased band shift with COS-1 extracts was attributed to the higher activity of the MT2 promoter of pTF3A, which drives transcription of the recombinant gene encoding COUP-TFII, in COS-1 cells relative to HepG2 cells.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Overexpression of COUP-TFII was associated with a reduction in DRBP binding, even in probes unable to be shifted by COUP-TFII (nt 72/59 and 65/54).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	176	 The reduction in DRBP binding may be attributed to the reduced proportion of DRBP in the given mass of protein in COS-1 nuclear extracts overexpressed with recombinant COUP-TFII.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Alternatively, if COUP-TFII interacts with DRBP in solution, the overexpressed COUP-TFII may be sequestering the DRBP and forms larger complexes with the probe nt 74/53.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	178	 COUP-TFII did not shift the probes lacking the COUP-TFII binding site (nt 72/59 and 65/54) (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	179	 It is apparent that COUP-TFII interacts with the DR4 of nt 74 to 53 and DRBP interacts with AGTTCAAG sequence (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	180	To further confirm that COUP-TFII binds to this sequence, antiserum raised against COUP-TF was added to an EMSA using the nt 74 to 55 oligomer as a probe of nuclear extract from HepG2 cells.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The band that increased in intensity when shifted by nuclear extracts from HepG2 overexpressing COUP-TFII was supershifted by the anti-COUP-TF antibody (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	182	 3), indicating that COUP-TFII was interacting directly with the region.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Extracts prepared from cells overexpressing recombinant C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, or HNF3 did not produce any changes in the band-shift pattern (data not shown), and antiserum directed against C/EBP (potential binding site at nt 52 to 41) and c-erbA (a homologue of the thyroid receptor that is regulated by phosphorylation events) did not change the gel shift pattern (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Antibody against RAR and RXR did not supershift the nt 74 to 53 probe.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	185	 However, when performed with extracts prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid, the ligand for RAR, the nt 74 to 54 probe was weakly supershifted with anti-RXR (data not shown).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	186	 DRBP, the major nuclear factor that binds to the sequence was not affected by the antibody, indicating that the proteins responsible for that band are distinct from COUP-TFII and RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	187	 These results confirm that the COUP-TFII binds to DR4 motif, which does not bind thyroid hormone receptor.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	188	 C/EBP, LAP, HNF4, and HNF3 do not bind to this region of CYP7A promoter.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	190	The probe nt 149 to 128 shifted one band in HepG2 nuclear extracts.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Antibody against COUP-TFII supershifted the oligomer and changed the pattern of bands as if a complex was disrupted (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The amount of probe supershifted was not increased with increasing amounts of antibody, indicating that antibody was in excess.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Antibody against RXR supershifted a band in HepG2 nuclear extract treated with retinoic acid.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	194	 The antibody directed against RAR did not supershift the probe even with extract prepared from HepG2 cells treated with all trans-retinoic acid.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Retinoic acid treatment may have increased the expression of endogenous RXR and showed the supershift with anti-RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	196	Once it had been determined that the antibody specific for RXR supershifted the nt 149 to 128 probe, nucleotides important for the binding of RXR were determined by EMSA with mutant oligonucleotides and the antibody against RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized in which three bases were changed by transversions.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Trinucleotide mutations in nt 145 to 134 completely abolished or reduced the supershift by antibody against RXR (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Mutations in nt 133/131 did not have any effect on supershift by antibody against RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These results indicate that RXR was interacting with the DR1 motif located from nt 146 to 134.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	201	Cotransfection assays of COUP-TFII expression plasmid with wild-type and mutant CYP7A proximal promoter constructs and EMSA results indicate that COUP-TFII interacts with nt 74 to 53 and nt 149 to 128 of the rat CYP7A promoter.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The region of nt 146 to 134 was shown by EMSA to bind RXR and contains HRE half-sites separated by one nucleotide (DR1), the preferred binding site for RXR homodimer (14).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The pattern of response of the mutants in nt 74 to 54 suggested that the nt 74 to 54 was the element with the strongest potential for COUP-TF activation of transcription.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The deletion of the sequences from nt 74 to 54 results in the increase of transcriptional activity of CYP7A promoter/reporter plasmids.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This sequence was previously found to mediate the bile acid response and to interact with DRBP, whose binding was sensitive to deoxycholate feeding in rats.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Interactions of transactivators COUP-TFII and RXR with DRBP and their competition for binding to these bile acid response elements may regulate the CYP7A gene transcription by bile acids and hormones.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP and C/EBP or LAP) (21) consensus binding site flank the COUP-TFII binding site at nt 74 to 54.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The C/EBP family of transcription factors are temporally regulated and are thus important developmental regulators of gene expression.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	210	 COUP-TFII may recruit C/EBP on to the apolipoprotein A1 promoter (22).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	211	 The DBP B-site, which also is the LAP binding site, was located in the nt 149 to 118 region (23).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, antibody directed against C/EBP and LAP did not supershift the nt 149/118 probe.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This is consistent with the lack of effect of these transcription factors on CYP7A promoter activity we observed.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The juxtaposition of the COUP-TF and C/EBP binding sites at nt 74/54 and nt 149/118 may prevent the weak binding of these factors.

0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	218	In light of the well-characterized negative effect of COUP-TFII on gene promoters, removing a COUP-TFII binding site in CYP7A promoter may explain the much higher activity of the deletion mutants (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, several recent reports support our finding that COUP-TFII also can function as a transactivator (24-27).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	220	 COUP-TFII binds as a stable homodimer to many variations of GGTCA sequences in direct repeats and interferes with vitamin D3, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid receptors by competing for the AGGTCA sites, the cognate sequences for the steroid/thyroid hormone receptors (15).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	221	 However, if the negative effect of COUP-TFII is due to interfering with a positive factor, over-expression of COUP-TFII should repress the transcriptional activity of the CYP7A promoter.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	222	 COUP-TFII activated transcription of the CYP7A promoter at all COUP-TFII expression plasmid to reporter plasmid ratios tried.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The deletion of the strong proximal COUP-TFII site at nt 74 to 55 may allow enhancers in the promoter to interact more readily with the transcriptional machinery and resulting in higher transcriptional activity.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	224	 COUP-TFII has been reported to interact with TFIIB (28) and to affect the transcriptional activity by interacting with other transcription factors.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	225	 For example, COUP-TFII is required for activation of the apolipoprotein A1 promoter by RXR (22).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	226	 As the COUP-TFII and RXR both recognized the nt 149 to 128 probe, it is possible that COUP-TFII may interact with RXR.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The heterodimer of COUP-TFII and RXR is known to bind a DR1 motif and transrepress gene transcription (13).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	228	Despite the finding that COUP-TF binds to a region responsive to bile acid repression, the role of COUP-TFII in the bile acid regulation of CYP7A is not clear and requires further study.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The region from nt 65 to 54 can confer the bile acid response to SV40 promoter, but the probe does not bind COUP-TFII in vitro (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, the DRBP and COUP-TFII apparently share binding sequence, the 3 COUP-TFII half-site overlaps with the DRBP binding site (Fig.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	231	 COUP-TF clearly influences cholesterol metabolism, in that this transcription factor has previously been shown to affect the transcription of the promoters for apolipoprotein AI (16), apolipoprotein AII, apolipoprotein B (29), apolipoprotein CIII (29, 30) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (27).
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	232	The physiological role of the sequences from nt 74 to 54 may be to restrain CYP7A expression.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	233	 This down-regulation may be necessary because of the cytotoxicity of bile acids and the need to preserve cholesterol for synthesis of steroid hormones and membrane components.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The exact interactions of the factors involved has yet to be defined; however, the data are consistent with a model in which COUP-TFII, RXR, and DRBP interact with and bind to a negative element in the region between nt 74 and 54 and a positive element from nt 149 to 118 (10) and lead to the regulation of the CYP7A gene transcription in response to signals from bile acids and hormones.
0.43622568.9092518.html.plaintext.txt	235	 This work contributes to the increasing body of evidence indicating COUP-TF has a prominent role in transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism and that factor binding to the nt 74 to 54 and nt 149 to 128 regions are important determinants of CYP7A transcription.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Nevertheless, the role of COUP-TFs in neurogenesis remains unknown.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We have studied the functional involvement of COUP-TFI in retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells through two complementary approaches: 1) deregulated expression of COUP-TFI, and 2) inactivation of endogenous COUP-TFs by means of a dominant- negative COUP-TFI mutant.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Low levels of wild-type (wt)COUP-TFI transgene expression did not inhibit neural cell fate and primarily enhanced neuron outgrowth from RA-treated P19 aggregates.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In contrast, high COUP-TFI expression impeded the neuronal differentiation of P19 cells induced with RA, resulting in cell cultures lacking neurons.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This morphological effect was correlated to an elevated level of E-cadherin mRNA.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The dominant-negative COUP-TFI mutant induced cell packing after RA treatment and inhibited neurite extension and neuron outgrowth from aggregates.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A RGD peptide interference assay indicated that endogenous COUP-TFs could favor migration of neurons through an integrin-dependent mechanism.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Accordingly, vitronectin mRNA levels were shown to be up-regulated by COUP-TFI by RT-PCR analysis, and COUP-TFI stimulated the mouse vitronectin promoter activity in transient transfection assays.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Taken together, these data indicate that COUP-TFI is not simply a global repressor of retinoid functions, but shows a high selectivity for regulating genes involved in cellular adhesion and migration processes that are particularly important for neuronal differentiation.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	19	 DNA binding, dimerization, transcriptional activation, and repression) and tissue distribution, with a particular emphasis on developmental processes (for review, see Ref.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In all the species that were examined for the presence of COUP-TF during development (from sea urchin to mouse), expression of this orphan receptor was clearly associated with neurogenesis (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Nonetheless, the precise role of COUP-TFI in the regulation of neuronal growth and differentiation is still unknown.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Recent studies suggest that COUP-TFI is involved in the regulation of cell-cell contacts (26) and modulates axonal growth (14, 27).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Indeed, COUP-TFI gene disruption in mouse results in decreased arborization of spinal nerves (14), in abnormal morphogenesis of the ninth cranial nerve and ganglion (14), and in defects in the guidance of axons emanating from thalamic neurons that normally project to cortical layer IV (27).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Disruption of the mouse COUP-TFII gene induced early lethality (before day 10 postcoitum), thus making it difficult to analyze the role of COUP-TFII in neurogenesis (28).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Even if a certain degree of redundancy between COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII is likely to exist, as in the case of retinoid receptors (29), these knock-out experiments suggest that each mouse COUP-TF gene ensures nonredundant functions.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	26	Several studies have pointed out the possibility that COUP-TF genes could be part of retinoid signaling pathways both in vivo and in cell culture systems (30, 31, 32, 33).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Notably, up-regulation of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII genes occurs during the differentiation programs triggered by retinoic acid (RA) in mouse teratocarcinoma cells such as P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (32).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Pluripotent P19 EC cells can be induced to differentiate into all three germ layer derivatives (i.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	29	 ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) when appropriate inducers and culture conditions are used (34, 35, 36).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	30	 When P19 cells are grown as aggregates, RA induces a neuroectodermal-like differentiation pathway that generates neurons, glial, and fibroblast-like cells (34, 37).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Therefore, P19 cells have been widely used to screen for genes involved in neuronal differentiation (38, 39, 40).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We report here the consequences of supraphysiological doses of COUP-TFI, and of functional inactivation of endogenous COUP-TFs, on the RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Morphological studies show that a too-early (or a too-high) expression of wild-type (wt)COUP-TFI impedes neural differentiation.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Remarkably, inhibition of endogenous COUP-TFs by expression of a dominant-negative COUP-TFI mutant resulted in a strengthening of cell-cell contacts, decreased axonal growth, and slower migration of neurons.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These data suggest a major function of COUP-TFI during development in controlling cell adhesion.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	36	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   C141S COUP-TFI Acts as a Dominant-Negative Mutant Inhibiting wtCOUP-TFI Binding to DNA Mutation C141S, by replacing the fourth cysteine residue of the second zinc finger by a serine, is likely to disrupt zinc coordination, and thus to disorganize the overall folding of the DNA-binding domain (DBD).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In accordance with this hypothesis, this COUP-TF mutant does not bind DNA (41).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Since the major dimerization interface of nuclear receptors is contained in the ligand-binding domain, we postulated that the mutant COUP-TFI should still be able to dimerize with the wtCOUP-TFI.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To test this hypothesis, we used a yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	40	 1A) and a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull-down assay (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	41	 These two complementary approaches generated similar results and showed that heterodimers of wt and mutant COUP-TFI can be formed.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Indeed, in the yeast system, ss-galactosidase activity was detected when the Gal4DBD/COUP-TFI construct was used in conjunction with either Gal4AD/COUP-TFI or Gal4AD/ mutCOUP-TFI (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data were confirmed in pull-down assays showing that a 35S-labeled mutCOUP-TFI was retained on a GST-wtCOUP-TF I matrix (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	44	 As the mutant COUP-TFI was defective in DNA binding, it seemed reasonable to assume that the wtCOUP-TFI/mutCOUP-TFI heterodimer would bind less stably to DNA than a wtCOUP-TFI homodimer.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This was verified by electromobility shift assays (EMSA) in which in vitro translated proteins were incubated with the high-affinity COUP-TF-binding site DR-1 (42) as a probe (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In vitro transcription/translation reactions were run with a fixed amount of pcDNA/wtCOUP-TFI vector (100 ng - 1X, Fig.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Whereas a strong binding of wtCOUP-TFI homodimers was seen on the DR-1 probe, no retarded complex was observed in the presence of mutCOUP-TFI (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Cotranslation of wtCOUP-TFI with increasing amounts of mutCOUP-TFI resulted in a progressive decrease in the amount of retarded complex, suggesting that mutCOUP-TFI could be used as a dominant-negative mutant to inhibit wtCOUP-TFI activity.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	71	  To determine whether the mutated COUP-TFI protein could alter wtCOUP-TFI-mediated transcriptional regulation, we cotransfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a retinoid-responsive reporter gene (ApoA1-tk-CAT) with or without retinoid receptor expression vectors in various combinations with wt and mutant COUP-TFI plasmids.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	72	 This reporter gene contains a DR-2 element overlapping a DR-1 element and is known to be activated by retinoid receptors, an activation that can be counteracted by COUP-TF probably through binding to the DR-1 site (45).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Surprisingly, when we cotransfected the reporter gene with increasing amounts of mutCOUP-TFI vector alone, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activities markedly increased (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	74	 This first observation suggested that CHO cells express endogenous COUP-TFs that are likely to repress the basal activity of the reporter gene and that the mutated COUP-TFI can block this repression.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In this respect, it seemed logical to counteract the positive effect of mutCOUP-TFI by cotransfecting the wtCOUP-TFI vector (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Retinoid receptors were able to activate the transcription of the reporter gene in the presence of 10-6 M RA, and this activation was even higher when mutCOUP-TFI was expressed (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	77	 These data imply first that endogenous COUP-TFs are able to partially repress retinoid receptors, and second that mutCOUP-TFI does not negatively interfere with retinoid receptor-mediated transcriptional activation.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This provides evidence for the specificity of mutCOUP-TFI action.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Finally, mutCOUP-TFI expression was able to abolish the retinoid receptor inhibition mediated by exogenous wtCOUP-TFI (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	80	 These transfection experiments thus allow the interpretation that mutCOUP-TFI specifically interferes with wtCOUP-TF functions, and thus may not alter other nuclear receptor signaling pathways.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Since these transfection data suggested that CHO cells did express endogenous COUP-TF genes, we ran a Western blot analysis and found that, indeed, CHO cells express detectable levels of COUP-TFII as shown in Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	82	 This was true also for Hela cells, whereas HepG2 cells did not express COUP-TFII (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Analysis of COUP-TFI expression showed that HepG2 cells but not CHO and Hela cells were positive for COUP-TFI in Western blot (data not shown).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Thus, in view of the transfection data, the mutant COUP-TFI is likely to be able to interfere with both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII functions since CHO cells express only COUP-TFII (note that a similar transfection experiment as the one shown in Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	85	 1D was run in Hela cells and gave identical results).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Even if in vitro data are suggestive of a direct inhibitory effect of mutCOUP-TFI on its wild-type counterpart, one cannot exclude that mutCOUP-TFI modulates wtCOUP-TFI or other nuclear receptors by titrating corepressors or coactivators.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, transfection data suggest that mutCOUP-TFI does not titrate the coactivators required for the transcriptional response to retinoids.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Indeed, the CMV promoter can be activated by cAMP in the teratocarinoma cell line PCC7 (43) as well as in P19 cells (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	91	 2A) [note that the CMV promoter is also activated about 3- to 4-fold above basal activity by RA in P19 cells (data not shown)].
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	92	 High levels of COUP-TFI mRNA were detected in cells transfected with wt or mutant COUP-TFI vectors and treated with 1 mM cAMP for 24 h (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	93	 2A), whereas low but detectable levels were seen in the absence of cAMP (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	94	 No COUP-TFI expression was detected in control cells treated or not with cAMP, in agreement with the fact that undifferentiated P19 cells do not express COUP-TFI (32).

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	96	 For these experiments, we used the DR-1 binding-site for COUP-TF and protein extracts from aggregated cells that had been treated either with cAMP for 48 h (Fig.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Extracts from P19 control cells (pcDNA) treated with cAMP generated a single complex with the DR-1 probe (noted by an asterisk, Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	99	 2B) that might be due to the interaction of EAR2 (a COUP-TF-related orphan receptor) with the DR-1 element according to Jonk et al.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	100	 When we used extracts from wtCOUP-TFI-transfected cells that had been treated with cAMP, a slower migrating complex appeared (arrow, Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	101	 2B) that reflected interaction of the exogenous COUP-TFI with the DR-1 probe, as shown by the antibody supershift (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The specificity of DNA recognition by the overexpressed wtCOUP-TFI was assessed by competition experiments in EMSA (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	103	 2C) using the DR-1 element as a probe.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The various competitors could be ranked as follows from high affinity to low affinity: DR-1, DR-7, DR-5, ERE, AP-1, and GRE, with the two last showing very low to no affinity for COUP-TF.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	105	 These data are in accordance with the known affinities of COUP-TF for different binding sites (21, 41, 44).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Treatment of P19 control cell aggregates with 10-6 M RA resulted in the appearance of a major complex mainly corresponding to COUP-TFI/DNA interaction as shown by the supershift obtained in the presence of COUP-TFI antibodies (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The lack of supershift in the presence of COUP-TFII antibodies suggests that the induction of the COUP-TFII gene might be delayed compared with the induction of the COUP-TFI gene.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In another experiment we compared the levels of DR-1 binding activity in the different cell lines (Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Cells containing the wtCOUP-TFI transgene expressed low levels of this orphan receptor in the absence of drugs, but high levels of wt COUP-TFI were observed in the presence of 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP (arrow, Fig.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The amount of complex generated from transgene expression was even higher than the one formed by the endogenous COUP-TFs after induction by 10-6 M RA.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Finally, when cells were treated with both RA and cAMP, the amount of COUP-TF/DNA complex was slightly higher than when cells were treated with cAMP alone.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Interestingly, the presence of high amounts of COUP-TFI inhibited the putative EAR2/DNA interaction (Fig.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In cells expressing the mutated form of COUP-TFI, cAMP did not induce the formation of a retarded complex (Fig.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	145	 When the mutant COUP-TFI cells were treated with RA alone, cells remained closely associated in compact clusters during 48 h, and a reduced number of phase-dark fibroblast-like cells and astrocytes developed when compared with control cells.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	150	 These results suggest either that high levels of mutated COUP-TFI are cytotoxic or cytostatic, or that endogenous COUP-TFs are required for cell survival during differentiation.

0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	248	Previous studies suggested that COUP-TF might be a global repressor of the functions of retinoids and other signaling molecules.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The remarkable DNA-binding flexibility of COUP-TF orphan receptors had led to the observation that they can repress several signaling pathways in cell culture systems, mainly through competition for liganded-nuclear receptor binding sites (44, 45, 61), and especially for RA response elements (44, 45, 62).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Additional evidence for a potential negative role of COUP-TFs on retinoid signaling came from experiments showing that COUP-TF I can form heterodimers with RXR on DNA, thus sequestering this promiscuous partner for RARs (63).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The existence of a regulatory loop was then suggested by data demonstrating that RA acid itself induces (or represses in some instance) the expression of COUP-TF genes in different systems such as P19 cells, Xenopus, zebrafish and mouse embryos (30, 31, 32, 33).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	252	 The relevance of the P19 cell as a model system for early differentiation is widely admitted (for review, see Ref.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	253	 These cells behave very much like ES cells when treated with RA (65, 66), and their use allowed the characterization of genes that show spatially and temporally restricted expression patterns during mouse development (38, 40, 66, 67).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Remarkably, several of the genes cloned from P19 cells induced to differentiate along the neuroectodermal pathway are exclusively expressed in the nervous system (38, 39, 67).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The data presented here are thus likely to reflect physiological functions of COUP-TFs.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Our experiments clearly indicate that early expression of COUP-TFI in P19 cells specifically affects neuronal cell fate.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Indeed, neuronal cells were absent from wtCOUP-TFI cells treated with RA and cAMP, even if these cells did express Brn-2.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Monolayers of the same cell line did differentiate into nonneural cell types and expressed high amounts of Stra8 transcripts in response to RA (data not shown).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	259	 These results suggest that COUP-TFI modulates the expression of RA-regulated genes in a differentiation-dependent manner.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Hence, the timing of COUP-TF expression needs to be tightly controlled during development to avoid inappropriate gene induction in cells normally committed to a neural fate.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	261	 In this respect, it must be mentioned that RA treatment of Xenopus embryos induces an earlier expression of the xCOUP-TF-A gene, when compared with control embryos (33).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	262	 It is then tempting to speculate that part of the teratogenic effects of RA are mediated by COUP-TF orphan receptors since injection of COUP-TF mRNA in Xenopus embryos leads to developmental defects in anterior neural structures that mimic those induced by an early RA exposure (68).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	263	By inhibiting the activity of endogenous COUP-TFs, we were able to confirm the involvement of these orphan receptors in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	264	 The clear differences between the phenotypes of our stable cell lines could be partly explained by changes in the expression levels of ECM molecules.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Our data suggest that COUP-TFI could favor neuron migration on glial cells by a RGD-dependent mechanism.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Vitronectin is recognized by integrin through an RGD motif and is involved in neural development (56, 69).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The integrin receptor vss1, which recognizes vitronectin, is required for efficient migration of embryonic cortical neurons along radial glial fibers (55).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Perturbation experiments using antibodies against vitronectin would certainly shed light on the potential involvement of vitronectin, and indirectly COUP-TFI, in neuronal migration.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	269	 A close relationship between vitronectin and COUP-TFs is also suggested by other observations.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	270	 First, as it is the case for COUP-TFII, vitronectin is expressed in developing motoneurons and P19 cells under the control of the morphogen sonic hedgehog (23, 70, 56).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Second, in perturbation experiments, antibodies against vitronectin inhibit motoneuron differentiation in vitro and in vivo (56).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Third, vitronectin has also been shown to be expressed at the surface of neural crest cells (NCCs) and required for the migration of these cells (71), and COUP-TFI is expressed in early mouse embryo in some premigratory and migratory NCCs (14).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	273	 And fourth, vitronectin supports axogenesis in PC12 cells (69).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The experiments described here are in favor of a direct control of the vitronectin gene by COUP-TF and suggest that COUP-TF could transduce a sonic hedgehog signal to the extracellular environment, at least in differentiating motoneurons.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	275	The present report provides evidence that COUP-TFs are regulators of cell adhesion mechanisms required for the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	276	 That COUP-TFs could, as a result, modify the migratory behavior of cells is an appealing hypothesis in view of their expression patterns during development.
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Indeed, these transcription factors are not exclusively expressed in the nervous system, but are also found in a number of other tissues at the time when tissue modeling through cell movements is a widespread event (19).
0.3001008.11117523.html.plaintext.txt	278	 We propose that COUP-TFs, which are the most conserved members of the nuclear receptor family throughout evolution (19), modulate cell adhesion-dependent morphogenetic processes in metazoan.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	4	Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that activates the 1-fetoprotein gene during early liver developmental growth.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here we sought to define better the position of FTF in transcriptional cascades leading to hepatic differentiation.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The mouse FTF gene was isolated and assigned to chromosome 1 band E4 (one mFTF pseudogene was also found).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Exon/intron mapping shows an mFTF gene structure similar to that of its close homologue SF1, with two more N-terminal exons in the mFTF gene; exon mapping also delimits several FTF mRNA 5'- and 3'-splice variants.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The mFTF transcription initiation site was located in adult liver at 238 nucleotides from the first translation initiator codon, with six canonical GATA, E box, and Nkx motifs clustered between 50/140 base pairs (bp) from the cap site; DNA/protein binding assays also pinpointed an HNF4-binding element at +36 bp and an FTF-binding element at 257 bp.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Transfection assays and point mutations showed that the mFTF promoter is activated by GATA, HNF4, FTF, Nkx, and basic helix-loop-helix factors, with marked cooperativity between GATA and HNF4.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	10	 A tandem GATA/E box activatory motif in the proximal mFTF promoter is strikingly similar to a composite motif coactivated by differentiation inducers in the hematopoietic lineage; a tandem GATA-Nkx motif in the distal mFTF promoter is also similar to a composite motif transducing differentiation signals from transforming growth factor--like receptors in the cardiogenic lineage.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three genes encoding transcription factors critical to early hepatic differentiation, Hnf3, Hnf4, and Hnf1, each contain dual FTF-binding elements in their proximal promoters, and all three promoters are activated by FTF in transfection assays.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Direct DNA binding action and cooperativity was demonstrated between FTF and HNF3 on the Hnf3 promoter and between FTF and HNF4 on the Hnf1 promoter.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These combined results suggest that FTF is an early intermediary between endodermal specification signals and downstream genes that establish and amplify the hepatic phenotype.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	15	5 days of mouse embryogenesis, endodermal cells of the ventral foregut interact with the cardiac mesoderm and become committed to the hepatic differentiation program; these newly specified cells then migrate and proliferate in the mesenchyme of the septum transversum where liver morphogenesis becomes apparent at E10.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Initial induction of hepatic functions is driven in part by growth factors of the FGF1 family, secreted by cardiac mesodermal cells and acting via transmembrane receptor kinases at the endodermal cell surface (3).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The process also involves potentiating transcription factors among which GATA factors appear essential to endodermal determination across vertebrates as well as invertebrates (Ref.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Following liver specification, transcriptional activation cascades further develop among early hepatic transcription factors creating interactive regulatory networks that amplify the induction signals and imprint the liver phenotype; the HNF4 gene product, for example, activates the Hnf1 gene whose product further enhances the Hnf4 gene promoter, and both HNF1 and HNF4 activate a broad spectrum of liver functions (5, 6).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	19	One of the earliest events marking endodermal specification to liver function is the activation of the 1-fetoprotein (AFP) locus, one of four albumin-related genes tandemly organized in the genome but differentially expressed during development (7).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The AFP gene is the first to be activated in the foregut endoderm (8), and therefore transcription factors that transduce early cell specification signals to unfold AFP chromatin are likely to exert high ranking liver differentiation functions.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	21	 One prime candidate in that regard is an orphan nuclear receptor originally pinpointed as a potent, highly specific and mandatory activator of the proximal AFP gene promoter (9-11).

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	23	 FTF is widespread and tightly conserved among vertebrates (14-17); its closest mammalian relative is SF1 (18) that is mainly expressed in steroidogenic cell lineages, whereas FTF is mainly expressed in gut derivatives.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	24	Early developmental patterns of FTF expression in several species (14, 17, 19) and its activation of the AFP locus in hepatocyte progenitors suggested an important role for FTF in endodermal differentiation pathways.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	25	 To gain better insight into FTF functions and its position in liver induction pathways, we isolated and functionally characterized the mouse FTF gene promoter in search for upstream FTF gene regulators, and we also searched for new FTF downstream gene targets.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The combined results make a compelling case for FTF as a key intermediary between initial signals of liver specification and cascade activations of other transcription factors that enhance hepatic differentiation.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Mutation of the HNF4 sequence (FmH4 in Table I) reduced basal mFTF promoter activity in HepG2 or Hep3B cells (Fig.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Also, when the two E box motifs were mutated (mE12), strong reduction of basal FTF promoter activity was observed (Fig.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The partial mFTF gene structure established here indicates an intron/exon organization similar to that of the Sf1 gene, which was duplicated from the same ancestral gene (14).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Like in man, the mouse Sf1 and FTF genes reside on different chromosomes (16, 29, 30).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The mouse FTF gene structure is largely conserved in zebrafish (17) but with an apparent evolutionary remodeling in the exon 2-3 domain, as discussed below.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	193	The mouse exon mapping indicates 5'-exon heterogeneity between FTF cDNAs cloned from different species.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Clones of human FTF cDNAs uniformly lack a sequence corresponding to mouse exon 2 (the hFTF cDNA clone we initially reported in Ref.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	198	 One human FTF variant (hB1F) (29) (CPF) (31) lacks both exons 2 and 3.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Rat FTF (rFTZ-F1) (32) also exists as two 5'-transcripts, one 21 amino acids shorter than the other and probably skipping exon 2.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In zebrafish, one FTF transcript (ff1-I) (17) contains a 17-amino acid exon 1 corresponding to mouse exon 1 and spliced to an exon corresponding to mouse exon 4, i.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	201	 also skipping the mouse homologue 2-3 domain.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, some FTF transcripts are 5'-splicing variants that lack most of the N-terminal protein (A/B) domain flanking the FTF DNA-binding domain.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	203	 FTF splice variant 1:4 (hB1F, CPF) is more abundant than variant 1:3 (hFTF, hB1F2, CPF-1) in human liver (29), and the shorter rat FTF variant (presumably 1:3) (rFTZ-F12) is also more abundant than the longer transcript (rFTZ-F11) (32).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	204	 These observations may indicate that the FTF N-terminal (A/B) domain fulfills no particular activatory functions, which would fit transfection data showing comparable transactivations by full-length FTF cDNA versus FTF devoid of the first 3 exons (pf1 versus pf4 in Ref.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	205	FTF also exists as C-terminal splice variants; human and Xenopus "short" variants (hFTFs and xFF1rAs) diverge to noncoding sequences at the 3'-splice junction of exon 6 (16, 33).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Other FTF cloning products include human FTF clone CPF-2 (31) truncated in exon 6 to restart with exon 7, and zebrafish ff1 clones "B" which also interrupt a C-terminal exon (17).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Such transcripts devoid of the AF2 activatory domain could in principle exert dominant negative functions (11, 21, 33); however, no significant amounts of such products have been detected in vivo (17, 33).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The FTF exons 2-3 domain is further considered below.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	209	Regulation of the mFTF Gene Promoter-- This report is also the first functional characterization of an FTF gene promoter.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Many cis-acting elements pinpointed here are stringently conserved in zebrafish (17); such evolutionary conservation suggests that these elements fulfill important regulatory functions.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Given the broad phylogenetic role of GATA factors in endodermal specification (4), a triple GATA-binding domain also suggests tight connections of the GATA-FTF pathway with endodermal differentiation, which conceivably could extend to invertebrate FTF/Ftz-F1 homologues (to the best of our knowledge, FTF is the first liver-enriched transcription factor gene directly activated by GATA).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	212	In cotransfection assays, GATA and HNF4 were highly efficient partners in coactivating the mFTF promoter, consistent with abundant coexpression of GATA4, HNF4, and FTF in mammalian liver.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	213	 However, FTF is also abundant in other tissues such as the adult exocrine pancreas in which HNF4 is not significantly expressed.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Furthermore, during development FTF gene expression precedes that of HNF4 (FTF can be unambiguously detected by in situ hybridization at E7.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	215	0 in the foregut endoderm,2 which is consistent with AFP gene transcription beginning at least from E8.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	216	0 (8)), and HNF4 knockout experiments also indicate that the FTF (and AFP) genes are efficiently expressed without HNF4 at early stages of liver differentiation (25).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Therefore the FTF promoter segment analyzed here would bypass HNF4 at prehepatic endodermal stages.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	218	Point mutations selecting the downstream GATA site or its adjacent E box element resulted in lower levels of basal FTF promoter activity, indicating that in hepatoma cells the proximal FTF regulatory domain 85/61 is subject to up-regulation by GATA and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	219	 bHLH proteins play important differentiation functions in diverse cell lineages and are plausible activators of the FTF gene at an early stage of development.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	220	 The tandem GATA/E box motif is also intriguingly similar to a composite element of the hematopoietic lineage, with the same orientation and spacing, and coactivated by a protein complex made of GATA1, bHLH factor Tal1, and several bridging molecules that include the LIM domain protein Lmo2 (34).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	221	 GATA1, Tal1, and Lmo2 are each required for proper development of the erythropoietic lineage, and genes activated by the composite GATA/E box motif are predicted to play critical differentiation functions in the blood cell lineage.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	222	 FTF could thus plausibly qualify as a first target gene for such a GATA/E box multiprotein activatory complex in the endodermal lineage.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Furthermore, a second FTF promoter E box element is present two nucleotides downstream from the first one and appears to down-regulate FTF promoter activity (Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	224	 3B, lane 8); this strikingly reproduces a variant hematopoietic GATA/E box motif in which the second E box serves to attenuate the adjacent GATA1-Tal1 multiprotein activatory complex (35).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Differential mFTF promoter activity between tissues or developmental stages might then finely respond to changing combinations of activatory or repressor components forming the GATA/E boxes complex.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	226	 We note here that the second E box is not conserved in the zebrafish promoter (see Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	227	 1B), the usage of which is much less restricted among adult tissues (abundant FTF transcripts ff1-I are detected in ovary, testis, and muscle) (17).

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This suggests that the distal GATA/Nkx segment may be less efficiently used in hepatocytes than in other cell types or liver differentiation states.

0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	237	An Alternative mFTF Promoter?-- FTF translational analyses in vitro and in vivo (11) have clearly established that rodent FTF exon 1 is transcribed in prenatal liver, and therefore that the promoter characterized here is used at fetal stages of development (hFTF exon1 transcripts are also present in fetal human liver) (29).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	238	 But data in lower vertebrates point to a second FTF promoter downstream from exon 1 and used preferentially at early stages of development.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	239	 FTF cloning from embryonic cDNA libraries has yielded transcripts with a translation start site corresponding either to the Met62 codon of mouse exon 3 (amphibian xFF1rA and rrFTZ-F1) (14, 40) (zebrafish ff1 variant II (17) also initiates translation at Met62) or to the Met94 codon of mouse exon 4 (frog rrFTZ-F1, chicken OR2.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Furthermore, the N-terminal exon of xFF1rA, ff1-II, and rrFTZ-F1 contains a 3'-end sequence matching mouse exon 3 segment Met62-Val89 (see Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	241	 1A) (17, 40), but its 5'-side sequence becomes unrelated to mouse exon 3 (17, 33, 40), and it spans 500 nucleotides in xFF1rAs (14, 33).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This readily suggests that FTF gene transcription starts in an intronic domain in which the exon 2-3 structure has been evolutionarily rearranged.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In addition, fish/amphibian transcripts containing exon 1 are undetectable at embryonic stages, whereas transcripts excluding exon 1 increase abundantly in early embryos and then decline (14, 17).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Thus, all indicate that at least in lower vertebrates FTF gene transcription proceeds from both the upstream promoter characterized here and from an internal "early" promoter yet to be mapped and independently regulated.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The early promoter also seems broadly activated in fish, amphibian, or avian embryonic cells (especially brain and steroidogenic tissues), whereas the upstream promoter is less promiscuous and more active in gut derivatives (14, 15, 17, 40).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	246	 We note that no SF1 transcripts have been found in fish (41); an alternate or ancestral FTF gene promoter possibly evolved in early vertebrates to better fulfill both FTF and SF1 functions in time and space.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Whether a second mFTF gene promoter may actively operate between exons 1 and 3 remains conjectural.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	248	 But FTF isoforms referred to translational variants, and fluctuating between adult liver and fetal liver or embryonic stem cells (11) might also indicate modulations in both promoter and splicing products; for instance, the four rat FTF isoforms (10) (see Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	249	 2A) interpreted as translational variants Met1, Met62, Met83, and Met87 (11) could also be accounted for by exon variants 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 3:4.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	250	 An alternative mFTF promoter might take charge of FTF transcription detected as early as the 2-cell stage embryo and in all cells of the E3.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	251	5 blastocyst (our unpublished results with a lacZ-marked mFTF genomic locus).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	252	Novel FTF-activated Gene Targets-- The Hnf3, Hnf4, and Hnf1 genes encode transcription factors critically involved in early liver differentiation, and the promoters of all three genes were found here to be activated by FTF.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Combined with temporal patterns of expression of these four factors (19, 25, 42, 43) and the fact that the FTF promoter, but not the Hnf3, Hnf4, and Hnf1 promoters, contain bona fide GATA-inducible sites, these results clearly suggest that FTF lies between GATA and HNF3, HNF4, and HNF1 in transcriptional cascades of liver cell differentiation.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Thus, as FTF initiates hepatic functions at the AFP promoter, it would also enhance other transcription factors engaged into liver-induction networks.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We recall here that AFP gene activity is restricted to early proliferative stages of liver development and that the FTF regulation domain in the AFP promoter is deactivated by hormonal signals that interrupt liver cell growth (9, 11, 44); this implies that the FTF function may be dependent upon or enhanced by cell growth stimuli.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Although other potential FTF liver gene targets have recently been proposed (21, 29, 31, 45, 46), it is uncertain whether all FTF effects can actually proceed in nongrowing hepatocytes since most results were obtained by cotransfection in growing cultured cells.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	257	 For one, the hepatitis B viral core promoter, strongly activated by three FTF-binding elements (21, 29), could have evolved FTF activation sites to adapt sustained hepatitis B virus replication with proliferative stages of hepatitis.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	258	 FTF action on the Hnf3, Hnf4, and Hnf1 promoters may then be exerted only transiently at early developmental growth stages and be substituted by alternative factors in mature nondividing hepatocytes; the Hnf3, Hnf4, and Hnf1 promoters all contain substitute proximal elements expected to operate efficiently under adult stage conditions.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	259	 But FTF clearly plays a role in hepatocyte bile acid synthesis pathways; FTF activates the rate-limiting Cyp7A gene promoter in adult hepatocytes (47), and FTF is a direct target for CYP7A feedback repression by FTF heterodimeric partner SHP induced by bile acid receptor FXR (48-50).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	260	 FTF could thus use alternative regulatory means to modulate differentially early developmental and late metabolic liver program.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	261	 It is interesting that the Hnf1, Hnf3, Hnf4, hepatitis B virus, and AFP promoters, but not Cyp7A, all contain a close doublet of FTF-binding sites (Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	262	2 This may point to novel regulatory means for DNA-bound FTF monomers operating during cell growth; transient FTF-FTF interactions via a cell cycle-dependent FTF modification, ligand, or coregulator is an intriguing possibility.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	263	The proximal FTF site in the HNF1 promoter is particularly interesting with regard to developmental growth signaling.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	264	 That site is stringently conserved in the Xenopus Hnf1 promoter (51), which undergoes developmental enhancement (52) closely parallel to that of the Xenopus FTF gene (xFF1rA) (14).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Furthermore, the FTF site in the xHnf1 promoter lies in a 30-bp domain essential to promoter activity (deletant 238/207 in Ref.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	266	 51), and it is contained in a short 69-bp promoter segment inducible by activin A (53), also a cell surface receptor ligand of the TGF- superfamily.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	267	 The 69-bp domain carries the conserved HNF4-binding site (5, 51) which, however, is dispensable for activation of the 69-bp domain in endodermal cells (54).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	268	 It is thus very tempting to infer that the endodermal activin A response element in the xHnf1 promoter is indeed FTF (xFF1rA).
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Given the fast kinetics of xHnf1 promoter induction by activin A ( < 6 h) (53), this may then imply that TGF- and/or FGF signaling could reach both the FTF gene promoter (as discussed previously) and the FTF protein itself.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	270	In conclusion, this combined analysis of FTF promoter regulatory elements and gene targets suggests that FTF is an early intermediary in the endodermal chain of events leading to hepatic differentiation.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Our results are consistent with a simplified scheme (Fig.
0.3133714.11145965.html.plaintext.txt	272	 6) where GATA cooperates with bHLH or homeodomain factors to activate the FTF gene in hepatocyte precursors, and the FTF gene product in turn activates early liver functions (AFP) and other transcription factors enhancing cross-regulatory networks to set the hepatic phenotype.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	4	HNF4 is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family with prominent functions in liver, gut, kidney and pancreatic  cells.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of the HNF4 ligand binding domain, which adopts a canonical fold.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Two conformational states are present within each homodimer: an open form with  helix 12 (12) extended and collinear with 10 and a closed form with 12 folded against the body of the domain.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although the protein was crystallized without added ligands, the ligand binding pockets of both closed and open forms contain fatty acids.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 at one end of the ligand binding pocket, while the aliphatic chain fills a long, narrow channel that is lined with hydrophobic residues.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These findings suggest that fatty acids are endogenous ligands for HNF4 and establish a framework for understanding how HNF4 activity is enhanced by ligand binding and diminished by MODY1 mutations.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Although MODY1 is rare ( < 20 families have been identified) (5, 8, 9), the associated phenotype is instructive.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Like other forms of MODY, MODY1 is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance, early onset ( < 25 years of age), and abnormal pancreatic  cell function.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Because reduced  cell function leads to insulin deficiency, it is reasonable to conclude that HNF4 activity is tightly coupled with insulin synthesis and secretion.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Since nuclear receptors are an established and valuable class of drug targets, it follows that selective agonists for HNF4 might be useful as new therapeutic strategies for improving insulin secretion in MODY patients and potentially others with more prevalent forms of type 2 diabetes.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Therefore, although a wide range of fatty acids were found within its ligand binding pocket, HNF4 appears to exhibit selectivity toward a subset of those found in bacteria.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Future experiments with mammalian tissues are required to determine which fatty acids bind under relevant conditions and whether the capacity of HNF4 to serve as a fatty acid sensor has physiological or pathological ramifications.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	90	The fact that the fatty acids were persistently bound even after a multistep purification indicated that they were tightly associated.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This was borne out by additional attempts to strip the lipids from the protein, as the fatty acids remained associated after dialysis and gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	92	The serendipitous presence of fatty acids provided an opportunity to analyze how ligands bind to HNF4.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The cavity has an internal volume of 370 A3, calculated by the program Voidoo (18), which is almost entirely occupied by fatty acid.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	96	 While this volume is within the normal range for nuclear receptor LBDs, the elongated, relatively linear shape of the pocket is atypical.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Both oxygens of the fatty acid head group are ion-paired with the guanidinium group of Arg226, and one oxygen forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Gly237 and side chain OH of Ser181 (Fig.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	106	Although HNF4 and RXR are similar in terms of amino acid sequence, their ligand binding specificities are distinct.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This is due in part to Phe313 in RXR, which points inward and directs bound 9-cis-retinoic acid upward toward 5 (19).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The corresponding residue in HNF4 is Ala223, which, presumably because of the decreased bulk of the side chain, allows the fatty acid ligand to curl downwards toward 7.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	109	 It is thus particularly interesting to note that F313A substitution in RXR leads to constitutive activation, due to the spontaneous binding of an endogenous fatty acid as we have seen for wild-type HNF4 (19).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The fatty acid in the binding pocket of RXR F313A adopts a U shape, and density is interpretable out to the C18 position.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In contrast, the side chains from residues Met182 and Met342 fill the upper portion of the HNF4 ligand binding pocket to prevent the fatty acid from looping around to form a U, and we don't see density past the C12 position.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation, with 12 situated against the body of the LBD.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The conformation of the "open" state is fixed by crystal packing between two open forms at an axis of symmetry.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In the closed state, residues Leu360, Leu361, Met364, and Leu365 form a hydrophobic face on 12 that interacts with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the body of the domain created by residues from 3 (Met182, Lys183, Leu186, Leu187, Leu189, and Val190) and 4 (Leu211, Ala215, Gly216, and Leu219).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Residues Gln362 and Glu363 help to anchor 12 through hydrogen bonds with Lys350 in 10 and Arg212 in 4, respectively.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Since fatty acid ligands similarly occupy the ligand binding pockets of molecules in open and closed conformations, the structural rearrangement does not appear to be required for ligand-mediated activation as has been proposed for other nuclear receptors (17, 20, 21).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	120	 It is possible that to lock the domain in its closed and active state, both ligand and coactivator must be bound, but since our structure lacks coactivator, it does not test this hypothesis.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	121	The Dimer Interface-- As opposed to many nuclear receptors that form heterodimers, HNF4 functions primarily as a homodimer (22).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Consistent with this, the LBD of HNF4 crystallizes as a canonical homodimer with near-perfect 2-fold symmetry about the interface (Fig.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	123	 A 1156-A2 surface of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	124	 A coiled coil interaction between 10 from each molecule dominates the interface, with hydrophobic side chain-side chain interactions (Phe325:Phe325, Leu329:Leu329, Leu330:Ile283, Leu332:Leu330, Pro333:Pro333 and Trp340:Trp340) along its length (Fig.

0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	126	MODY1 Mutations-- Of 14 mutations in HNF4 that have been found in patients with the MODY1 form of diabetes (5, 8, 9, 23), three encode substitutions within the LBD (V255M, E276Q, R324H).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The side chain of Val255 (in 7) points into the ligand binding cavity where it participates in ligand recognition.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	128	 While questions have been raised about functional consequences of the V255M substitution (24), the structure suggests that a methionine side chain at this position would partially occlude the ligand binding cavity and potentially alter binding affinity or specificity.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Contact between Val255 and backbone atoms of 10 in the vicinity of Met342 is also predicted to stabilize the protein fold.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Therefore, the V255M substitution might also decrease protein stability and reduce its concentration in cells or ability to homodimerize.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Side chains from the other two MODY1-associated residues, Glu276 (amino terminus of 8) and Arg324 (9/10 loop), form an ionic interaction, and Glu276 forms a second ionic interaction with Arg317 (also in the 9/10 loop).
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Neither of these residues is involved directly in ligand binding, but mutations in them may influence dimerization.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	133	 While the residues themselves are not at the dimer interface, the 9/10 loops of two molecules interact with each other.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Since the residues help tether the 9/10 loops, it is likely that loss of interactions between Glu276 and Arg324 would destabilize dimerization.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	135	Conclusions-- The LBD of HNF4 is structurally similar to the LBDs of other nuclear receptors.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The presence of a fatty acid in its ligand binding pocket is especially noteworthy and should help resolve the controversy surrounding putative ligands for HNF4.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	137	 From a structural point of view, the fatty acid appears to be an ideally suited ligand for HNF4.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 of the protein to fix the orientation, while the aliphatic portion of the fatty acid occupies a long narrow pocket that is lined with hydrophobic side chains.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Considering this mode of binding, it is not obvious how more complex ligands might bind HNF4.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	140	 It is thus reasonable to presume that fatty acids or related molecules might be the endogenous ligands for HNF4.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The high apparent affinity of recombinant HNF4 for fatty acids suggests a similar situation for the native protein in mammalian cells, providing a mechanism for HNF4 to function as a biosensor for fatty acids within the cell.
0.2872687.12193589.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The structural features of fatty acid binding to HNF4 provide a useful starting point for identifying potential pharmacophores, but the search may prove all the more challenging due to the kinetics of ligand binding.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	5	In the liver, glucocorticoids induce a 10-15-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene, which encodes a key gluconeogenic enzyme.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	6	 This induction requires a multicomponent glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) comprised of four glucocorticoid accessory factor (AF) elements and two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We show that the AFs that bind the gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 elements (hepatocyte nuclear factor [HNF]4/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 and HNF3) all interact with steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This suggests that the AFs function in part by recruiting coactivators to the GRU.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The binding of a GAL4-SRC1 chimeric protein completely restores the glucocorticoid induction that is lost when any one of these elements is replaced with a GAL4 binding site.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, when SRC1 is recruited directly to gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3, the requirement for the corresponding AF is bypassed.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Surprisingly, glucocorticoid receptor is still required when SRC1 is recruited directly to the GAL4 site, suggesting a role for the receptor in activating SRC1 in the context of the GRU.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Structural variants of GAL4-SRC1 were used to identify requirements for the basic-helix-loop-helix and histone acetyltransferase domains of SRC1, and these are specific to the region of the promoter to which the coactivator is recruited.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	13	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	14	Mammals must have a readily adaptable mechanism for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the face of fluctuations in nutrient supply.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Hormones such as glucocorticoids control transcription of genes that encode enzymes that help provide the adaptive response to these environmental changes (3-5).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These hormone responses were originally thought to be mediated through a direct interaction of the hormone receptor and a simple DNA element, the hormone response element (HRE)1 (6-8).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In recent years it has become apparent that more complex structures are involved.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Hormone response units, comprised of HREs and accessory factor (AF) elements have been found in many genes involved in metabolic regulation (9-14).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	19	 AFs are DNA binding transcription factors that act in concert with the hormone receptor to provide the flexible regulation of gene transcription required for metabolic homeostasis (5, 6, 15, 16).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	20	In addition to their function in hormone-mediated gene transcription, AFs also play a central role in determining how metabolites regulate transcription.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	21	 For instance, glucose-stimulated transcription of the L-PK gene requires a glucose response element that binds transcription factors of the upstream stimulating factor family.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This glucose response, however, is regulated positively or negatively by the binding of HNF4 or COUP-TF, respectively, at an adjacent accessory element (17-20).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, Osborne and co-workers show that, in the absence of cholesterol, SREBP activates transcription of the low density lipoprotein receptor and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene promoters (21-23).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	24	 An SREBP response element (SRE) alone, however, is not sufficient for activation of either gene.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The activation of the low density liproprotein receptor gene promoter by SREBP requires not only a sterol response element but also an SP1 binding element (21, 24).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	26	 SP1 binding to this promoter correlates with transcription of the gene in the absence of cholesterol (9).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Similarly, the activation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene expression by SREBP requires both a sterol response element and an element that binds nuclear factor Y (9, 22, 23).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	28	The role of AFs is well characterized in the regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In adipose tissue, where PEPCK is involved in glycerogenesis, glucocorticoids repress basal and cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription (25, 26).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	30	 By contrast, the PEPCK gene is stimulated by glucocorticoids in the liver, where PEPCK is an important control point for gluconeogenesis (16, 27).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In the liver, glucocorticoids induce an 10-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene through a multicomponent glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) located in the promoter region (28).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The GRU consists of a tandem array of four AF elements (gAF1-3 and the cAMP response element) that bind HNF4/COUP-TF, HNF3, COUP-TF, and C/EBP, respectively, and two nonconsensus glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GR1, GR2) (13, 28-32).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Interestingly, neither HNF3 nor HNF4 is expressed in adipose tissue, whereas both are expressed at high levels in the liver (33-35).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus, the accessory factors HNF3 and HNF4 appear to play an additional important role in facilitating tissue-specific induction of PEPCK gene transcription.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	35	A mutation of any one of the accessory elements results in a 50-60% reduction of glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription in H4IIE hepatoma cells (28, 32, 36, 37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Any combination of two mutations of gAF1/gAF3 or gAF2 nearly abolishes the response (28, 37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The physiologic importance of these gAFs is evident in their role in glucose production.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Overexpression of an HNF3 variant that reduces the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids by ~50% nearly abolishes glucocorticoid-induced glucose production in hepatoma cells (14).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	39	These gAF elements are not all functionally equivalent in the context of the PEPCK gene promoter (28, 31, 38).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	40	 gAF1 and gAF3 can be exchanged, a finding consistent with the observation that COUP-TF binds to both elements.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, gAF1/gAF3 cannot be replaced with gAF2 and vice versa (37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, the spacing between gAF2 and GR1 must be maintained, whereas this is not as important for gAF1 and gAF3 (37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	43	 HNF3, the AF that binds gAF2, interacts with GR in vitro (37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, direct contact between HNF3 and GR may be important for stabilizing GR binding to the GR1 and GR2 elements of the PEPCK gene promoter, which bind GR with low affinity relative to a consensus GRE (36).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In fact, these nonconsensus elements (GR1 and GR2), either alone or in combination, cannot by themselves mediate a glucocorticoid response when placed in the context of a heterologous promoter (36).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Thus, the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene is completely dependent on the gAF elements and the factors that bind to these sites.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, the mechanism by which AFs control the direction and magnitude of PEPCK gene transcription in response to glucocorticoids remains largely unknown.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	48	The recruitment of coactivator molecules provides a crucial step in the integration of the functions of steroid hormone receptors and AFs with the basal transcription machinery (2, 39, 40).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Coactivators generally do not bind DNA, but instead associate with DNA-bound activator proteins.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Some coactivators such as CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) mediate the functions of a diverse group of transcription factors.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Others, such as steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) and glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein (GRIP1), are functionally more specific in that they interact with activator proteins involved in steroid hormone-mediated gene transcription (41, 42).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	52	In this study, we show that the AFs bound to the gAF1 and gAF2 elements of the PEPCK gene promoter recruit the coactivator molecule SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	53	 HNF4 and COUP-TF interact with SRC1 through the domains required for their AF activity (1, 2).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	54	 We show here that HNF3 also interacts with SRC1 through the same domain required for its AF activity in the PEPCK gene promoter.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Mutations of either gAF1 or gAF2 that prevent HNF4/COUP-TF or HNF3 from binding, including replacement of the gAF element with a GAL4 binding site (gAFGAL4), result in a 50-60% reduction of the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids (43).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The binding of a GAL4-SRC1 chimeric protein to a gAF1GAL4 or a gAF2GAL4 element in a PEPCK luciferase reporter gene construct completely restores the glucocorticoid induction.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Thus, when SRC1 is recruited directly to gAF1 or gAF2, the requirement for the corresponding AF is functionally bypassed.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Surprisingly, even when SRC1 is recruited to the PEPCK gene promoter in this manner, active involvement of ligand-bound GR is still required, suggesting a role of the receptor in activating SRC1 in the context of this enhanceosome.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Finally, we show that the bHLH and HAT domains of SRC1 function differently according to the component of the PEPCK gene GRU to which the coactivator is recruited.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated overnight in serum-free medium with or without 500 nM dexamethasone, as described in the figure legends.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	73	 In experiments performed with H4IIE cells, the glucocorticoid response varied from 7- to 20-fold (with dexamethasone/without dexamethasone).

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Glucocorticoids cause a 15-fold induction of reporter enzyme activity when a PEPCK gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct that contains all of the gAF elements is expressed transiently in H4IIE hepatoma cells (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	100	 H4IIE cells have significant amounts of endogenous accessory factors and potential coregulators such as SRC1 to provide for this response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	101	2 The presence of large amounts of these wild-type proteins, however, makes it difficult to analyze the effects of their transiently expressed variants on PEPCK gene transcription.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Mutations of the gAF1 element that prevent HNF4/COUP-TF from binding, including replacement of gAF1 with a GAL4 binding site (gAF1GAL4), result in a 50-60% reduction of the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids, as noted previously (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The GAL4 binding site can bind chimeric proteins that contain domains of interest and, thus, can serve as a surrogate gAF element.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	104	 This is useful because the endogenous PEPCK AFs cannot function through this surrogate gAF element; thus, they are effectively removed from the analytical system.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	107	 H4IIE cells were transfected with 5  microg of the PEPCK-LUC reporter construct (wild-type PEPCK gene promoter, from position 467 to +65 relative to the transcription start site, fused to LUC) and 2.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Alternatively, cells were transfected with 5  microg of a reporter construct based on PEPCK-LUC in which the gAF2 element has been mutated to a GAL4 DNA binding element (gAF1GAL4).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	110	 These cells were cotransfected with 0.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium with or without hormone overnight.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed as described under "Experimental Procedures.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	114	" These results represent the mean  plus or minus  S.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	115	The reduction of the glucocorticoid response caused by replacement of the gAF1 element with a GAL4 element cannot be restored by expression of the GAL4-DBD, indicating that the GAL4-DBD cannot act as an AF through this surrogate gAF1 element (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	116	 By contrast, the binding of chimeric proteins consisting of the GAL4-DBD and either HNF4 or COUP-TF restores the glucocorticoid response (1, 43).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	117	 It is possible that HNF4 and COUP-TF recruit coactivator molecules to form a glucocorticoid-specific enhanceosome, whereas the GAL4-DBD does not.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These coactivators, in turn, could stabilize the enhanceosome complex and/or provide necessary activation to the promoter region (47).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In support of this model, we have shown that HNF4 and COUP-TF (AFs which bind gAF1 and gAF3) interact with SRC1 through the domains demonstrated to be required for their accessory factor activity (1, 2).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	120	We hypothesized that, if the role of HNF4/COUP-TF at gAF1 is to recruit coactivators such as SRC1, then direct recruitment of the latter to the gAF1 element by making a chimeric protein with the GAL4-DBD and full-length SRC1 (GAL4-SRC1) should also mediate the glucocorticoid response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Indeed, the binding of GAL4-SRC1 completely restores the glucocorticoid induction through a gAF1GAL4 PEPCK-LUC construct (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Thus, the requirement for the AF is bypassed when SRC1 is recruited directly to gAF1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Surprisingly, there is little increase in basal promoter-reporter activity with GAL4-SRC1 expression in the absence of glucocorticoids (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This implies that, even when SRC1 is constitutively recruited by a GAL4 binding element, active involvement of ligand-bound GR is still required, suggesting a role of the receptor in activating SRC1 in the context of the enhanceosome.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	125	 We and others also show that the coactivator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) interacts with HNF4 (2, 48).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	126	 A fusion construct expressing a GAL4-CBP chimeric protein also restores the lost glucocorticoid response through the gAF1GAL4 PEPCK-LUC construct (data not shown).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Thus, one role of the AF bound at the gAF1 element appears to be recruitment of its cognate coactivators.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	128	In a set of experiments similar to those shown in Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	129	 1, we found that GAL4-SRC1 can also replace COUP-TF at gAF3 in a construct where the gAF3 element was changed to a GAL4 binding element, gAF3GAL4 PEPCK-LUC (data not shown).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This result is not surprising since the gAF1 and gAF3 elements are interchangeable, and both bind COUP-TF.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The amino acid region from 408-423 of COUP-TFI is necessary for this protein to function as an AF in the PEPCK gene GRU (1).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	132	 This same region of COUP-TFI is also essential for the interaction with SRC1 (1).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	133	 These observations suggest that GAL4-SRC1 replaces some essential function of the AFs that bind to these elements in the native promoter.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	134	Coactivator Recruitment Does Not Relieve the Requirement for Active Involvement of Ligand-bound GR in the Glucocorticoid Response-- The ligand-bound GR could serve primarily as a signal transducer for recruitment of coactivators and assembly of a glucocorticoid-specific enhanceosome.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	135	 If so, ligand-bound GR would no longer be required after this enhanceosome is assembled.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The low basal reporter gene activity in cells expressing GAL4-SRC1 was surprising, as the coactivator is constitutively bound to the promoter, yet the reporter gene is inactive in the absence of glucocorticoid treatment (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We therefore reasoned that there must be active involvement of ligand-bound GR for GAL4-SRC1 to function as a surrogate AF.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	138	 In a set of experiments performed concomitantly with those described in Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	139	 1, PEPCK promoter reporter gene constructs were made in which block mutations were created in either GR2 or both of the GREs (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Since GR1 is more important than GR2 in the glucocorticoid response (36), we were able to create a graded system in which only ~40% (GR2 mutated) or all of the function of GR is eliminated (GR1 and GR2 mutated), respectively.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Mutation of GR2 or both GREs severely blunts or eliminates the glucocorticoid response, respectively, even when GAL4-SRC1 is tethered to the promoter through the surrogate gAF1 element (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	142	View larger version (25K):    Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	143	   The PEPCK gene glucocorticoid response requires GR binding even after coactivator recruitment.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	144	 These experiments were performed as described in Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	145	 1, except that the reporter constructs illustrated in the inset were used.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In the inset, crosses through the GR1 or GR2 elements represent block mutations in these elements that prevent GR form binding.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	147	 For simplicity, results are represented relative to the fold induction of wild-type PEPCK-LUC by glucocorticoids, taken as 100%.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	149	GAL4-SRC1 Can Also Replace the AF Function of the gAF3-bound Factor-- The gAF1/3 and gAF2 elements are not interchangeable in the PEPCK gene GRU (36, 37).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	150	 As expected, about 60% of the glucocorticoid response is lost when gAF2 is changed to a GAL4 binding element (gAF2GAL4 PEPCK-LUC) (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This AF activity cannot be restored by coexpression of the GAL4-DBD but is completely restored by GAL4-HNF3 (43).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Despite the functional distinction between gAF1/3 and gAF2, GAL4-SRC1 recruitment to gAF2GAL4 PEPCK-LUC completely restores the glucocorticoid response lost by mutation of this element (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Thus, GAL4-SRC1 can act as a surrogate AF through gAF2 as well, and in so doing, it provides a functional bypass of the requirement for HNF3.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	159	HNF3 Interacts with SRC1 in Vivo-- As mentioned previously, HNF4 and COUP-TF, the AFs that bind gAF1 and gAF3, both interact with SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	160	 We proposed that GAL4-SRC1 could serve as a surrogate AF through gAF1 and gAF3 when these elements are changed to a GAL4 binding element, respectively, because SRC1 is recruited to the promoter at an appropriate position (this paper and Refs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	161	 If SRC1 replaces a distinct function of HNF3 in the GRU, it is possible that HNF3 also interacts with SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	162	 To test this, an expression vector for SRC1 was cotransfected into HeLa cells with GAL4-HNF3 or variants thereof and a luciferase reporter plasmid that contained a minimal E1b promoter positioned downstream of five GAL4 binding elements [(GAL4)5-E1b-LUC].
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	163	 All GAL4 constructs were expressed at low levels (0.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	164	5  microg of vector) to allow for maximal coactivation by SRC1.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The additional increase of activity provided by SRC1 is presented relative to the activity of the GAL4-DBD and is expressed as fold coactivation when equal amounts of DNA from the control vectors were transfected.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	172	 These results represent the mean  plus or minus  S.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	173	The region of HNF3 encompassing amino acids 361-458 is required for the AF activity of this protein (43).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The interaction of SRC1 with GAL4-HNF3361-458 results in a 12-fold coactivation, whereas GAL4-HNF3 361-442, which cannot act as an AF (43), is ineffective (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, the region of HNF3 required for AF activity in the GRU may act by recruiting SRC1, a finding consonant with the ability of GAL4-SRC1 to replace the function of HNF3 on the gAF2GAL4 PEPCK-LUC reporter construct.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	176	Promoter- and Element-specific Requirements for the bHLH/PAS and HAT Domains of GAL4-SRC1-- It is difficult to analyze the effect of transiently expressed SRC1 variants in the presence of significant amounts of the endogenous, wild-type protein.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, the system described in the previous figures, in which GAL4-SRC1 is recruited to the GAL4 element of the gAFGAL4 PEPCK and (GAL4)5-E1b promoters, respectively, is useful because variants of GAL4-SRC1 can be specifically targeted to these promoters, effectively removing endogenous SRC1 from the analytical system.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	178	 This system can be used to identify the minimal functional domains of SRC1 required for the PEPCK glucocorticoid response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	179	SRC1 was originally identified from a cDNA that lacked the region encoding the 41-most N-terminal amino acids (40).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The protein encoded by this cDNA does not function as a coactivator for HNF4,2 although it still presumably binds HNF4 through the nuclear receptor binding motifs, NRBI-IV, which are present in the truncated protein.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	181	 By contrast, full-length SRC1 does serve as a coactivator for HNF4, and as a GAL4-chimeric protein, it can replace HNF4 as an AF on a gAF1GAL4 PEPCK-LUC construct (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Expression of a variant of GAL4-SRC1 that lacks the N-terminal 45 amino acids (GAL4-SRC1-bHLH) does not replace HNF4 as an AF (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This GAL4-SRC1-bHLH protein provides no more AF activity than does the GAL4-DBD alone or a deletion of the gAF1 element (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Thus, the ability of GAL4-SRC1 to serve as a surrogate AF through the gAF1 element correlates with its ability to coactivate HNF4, the AF that binds this element in the wild-type promoter (30, 43).

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	196	SRC1, with its resident acetyltransferase activity and protein-protein interaction surfaces, could serve both as a structural adapter molecule in the GRU enhanceosome and also to promote transcription by the acetylation of chromatin components and transcription factors (49-51).

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This preincubation with the anti-GAL4-DBD antibody prevents each complex from forming, but an unrelated antibody (anti-Lex A) is without effect (Fig.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	207	 It is not known why GAL4-SRC1-bHLH migrates slightly more slowly.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	208	 All of these proteins migrate as expected, as determined by Western blot analysis, when the gel is run under denaturing conditions (data not shown).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	209	The gAF1 and gAF2 elements are functionally distinct in the PEPCK gene GRU (36, 37); thus, we speculated that there might be different requirements for SRC1 when it is recruited through these respective sites.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	210	 As seen at gAF1, the acetyltransferase activity of SRC1 is also required at gAF2, since GAL4-SRC1HAT does not mediate AF activity (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	211	 As at the gAF1 element, the NRBIV region of GAL4-SRC1 is also dispensable at gAF2 (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	212	 However, by contrast to the functional requirements of GAL4-SRC1 at gAF1, where the bHLH/PAS domain is critical to the surrogate-AF activity provided by this protein, the bHLH/PAS region is completely dispensable at gAF2 (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	213	 The distinct requirements of various regions of GAL4-SRC1 at gAF1, as compared with gAF2, supports the contention that the gAF1 and gAF2 elements have distinct roles in the glucocorticoid response (36).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	214	 This result also suggests that GAL4-SRC1 replaces some essential, but distinct function of both HNF4/COUP-TF and HNF3 at gAF1 and gAF2, respectively.

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	223	The element-specific requirements for GAL4-SRC1 at gAF1 and gAF2 demonstrate that multiple functions of coactivators are required for the PEPCK glucocorticoid response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	224	 These requirements may be determined by the local promoter environment to which the coactivator is recruited.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This high degree of specificity may also reflect promoter-specific requirements of the bHLH/PAS and HAT domains of SRC1 between different promoters.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	226	 None of the GAL4-SRC1 variants significantly activate basal PEPCK gene promoter-reporter activity (Figs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	227	 1 and 3); however, GAL4-SRC1 has low basal transactivation potential through a simple promoter that contains multimerized GAL4 binding elements (53).

0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	243	The accessory factors HNF4, COUP-TF, and HNF3 are required for maximal induction of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids (13, 28-32), and each interacts with the coactivator SRC1 through exactly the same regions required for their AF function (this paper and Refs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This series of observations strongly suggests that recruitment of SRC1 is important for the glucocorticoid response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Recruitment of SRC1, however, does not exclude recruitment of other coactivators such as CBP to, or by, the same AFs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	246	 We envision that, together, the AFs provide a surface for recruitment of a coactivator complex that includes SRC1, CBP, and probably other proteins.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The PEPCK gene GRU shares DNA elements with the hormone response units that provide a response to retinoic acid, cAMP, and insulin (38), but different transcription factors are recruited to the AF elements in response to these hormones (37, 54, 55).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	248	 It is probable that the constellation of coregulators recruited by each of these effectors is also different, yet somehow this array of hormone response units provides a coordinated response to the metabolic challenges imposed by hypoglycemia, when the PEPCK gene is activated, and hyperglycemia, when the gene is repressed.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	249	The ability of GAL4-SRC1 to replace the function of the AFs bound to gAF1, gAF2, or gAF3 in the GRU shows that the precise factor that binds these elements is less critical than is the ability of these proteins to assemble a functional enhanceosome.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	250	 There is, however, specificity associated with these AFs in the GRU.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The observation that the PEPCK gene GRU uses liver-enriched factors such as HNF4 and HNF3 to recruit coregulatory molecules rather than ubiquitously expressed factors provides insight into how tissue specificity of gene transcription in response to glucocorticoids may arise.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In this regard, it is noteworthy that in adipose tissue, which does not express HNF4 or HNF3 but does express GR, glucocorticoids repress basal and cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription (25, 26).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Thus, tissue-specific expression of the AFs may provide directionality to gene transcription in response to glucocorticoids, as well as contributing to the magnitude of the response.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	254	The precise role of ligand-bound GR in mediating this response is less clear.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	255	 A previous in vivo footprint analysis showed that all of the gAF elements in the GRU are occupied in the absence of glucocorticoids (56).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Here we show that GAL4-SRC1 is only able to function as a surrogate AF when GR is present (Figs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Upon exposure to the ligand, the GR may help promote the formation of a functional enhanceosome by interacting with SRC1 to recruit components of the basal transcription machinery.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	258	 GR may also activate SRC1 once the latter has been recruited to the GRU by AFs such as HNF4, COUP-TF, and HNF3.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The activation of coactivators by nuclear receptors is not unprecedented.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The function of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator, PGC1, is stimulated by its association with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (57).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	261	 This protein-protein interaction promotes a conformational change in PGC1 that permits recruitment of additional coactivators SRC1 and CBP/p300 (57).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	262	 We propose that the binding of GR to the PEPCK gene GRU promotes activation of SRC1 and assembly of a functional enhanceosome in a similar fashion.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	263	 The interaction between GR and SRC1 appears to be facilitated by localization of GR to its DNA binding elements.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	264	 When both the GR1 and GR2 elements are intact, GAL4-SRC1 is able to serve as a surrogate AF at gAF1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	265	 As the ability of GR to be recruited to the promoter is reduced or lost by introducing mutations in the GR2 or GR1 and GR2 elements, respectively, the ability of GAL4-SRC1 to serve as a surrogate AF is reduced or lost in a coordinate manner (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	266	All of the p160 family of coactivators contain three central LXXLL motifs (NRBI-III) that are important for interaction with nuclear receptors (58, 59).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	267	 SRC1a, used in these experiments, has an additional C-terminal LXXLL motif (NRBIV) that exhibits strong in vitro binding to class I nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor and GR (39, 52, 59, 60).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	268	 One might imagine that the NRBIV domain could help stabilize GR binding to the low affinity GR1 and GR2 elements.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	269	 If so, deletion of the NRBIV region of SRC1 (GAL4-SRC1IV) should reduce the effectiveness of GAL4-SRC1 as a surrogate AF.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Deletion of this region is without effect, however, as GAL4-SRC1IV functions comparably with the full-length chimeric protein (Figs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	271	 show that, although NRBIV is the nuclear receptor interaction motif that interacts most strongly with estrogen receptor in vitro, deletion of this region has little functional consequence in estrogen receptor activation, providing the NRBI-III region is intact (60).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	272	 This suggests that multiple LXXLL motifs facilitate the in vivo effects of SRC1 on nuclear receptors.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Rather than stabilizing GR binding, the SRC1-GR interaction may be more important for the activation of SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	274	 By this model, AFs such as HNF4, COUP-TF1, and HNF3 would serve to recruit SRC1, which in turn is only activated by the additional presence of ligand bound GR.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	275	The recruitment of GAL4-SRC1 or variants of this protein to promoter constructs with GAL4 binding elements (gAFGAL4 PEPCK and (GAL4)5-E1b promoters, respectively) allowed us to look for promoter- and DNA element-specific requirements of SRC coactivation.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The bHLH region of GAL4-SRC1 is required for AF activity at the gAF1 element (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	277	 GAL4-SRC1-bHLH also provides a low rate of basal transcriptional activation through the simple E1b promoter (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The bHLH/PAS domain of SRC1 is highly conserved among the p160 family of coactivators, and the PAS motif serves as a protein-protein interaction surface for the transcription factors, Per, ARNT, and SIM (61, 62).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	279	 The importance of the bHLH/PAS domain of SRC1 in the context of the PEPCK gene GRU may indicate the requirement for interaction with an additional PAS-containing factor that is necessary for SRC1 function.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Interestingly, this region is not required when GAL4-SRC1 is recruited to gAF2 (Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This result supports the idea that these gAF elements and associated factors have distinct roles in the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	282	The acetyltransferase domain of GAL4-SRC1 is required at both gAF1 and gAF2 (Figs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	283	 5a and 6); however, the target of this acetyltransferase activity in the PEPCK gene GRU is unknown.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Acetylation of chromatin components and transcription factors correlates with activation of gene transcription (49, 50, 63-65).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	285	 The chromatin structure of the PEPCK gene promoter is already free of nucleosomes before exposure to hormone in H4IIE cells (66); thus, it is unlikely that this is the target of the acetyltransferase activity required of SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	286	 There are several other potential targets for the acetyltransferase activity of SRC1 in the GRU.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	287	 HNF4 can be acetylated by CBP, a reaction that promotes DNA binding and nuclear retention of HNF4 (64).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The androgen receptor can also be acetylated by CBP (67); thus, it is possible that other nuclear receptors, such as GR, may also be acetylated.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Different targets of the acetyltransferase activity of SRC1 (chromatin components versus transcription factors) may also explain why GAL4-SRC1HAT strongly activates a simple promoter but is not functional at any of the PEPCK gAF elements tested (Figs.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	290	The use of the GAL4-SRC1 chimeric protein to recruit this coactivator to specific DNA elements allowed us to demonstrate both promoter-specific requirements of SRC1 (between the simple and PEPCK gene promoters) and also element-specific requirements for domains of SRC1 at gAF1 and gAF2 in the PEPCK gene GRU.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	291	 A summary of these differences is illustrated in Fig.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	292	 HNF4/COUP-TF and HNF3 mediate distinct functions as AFs, yet they are both capable of interacting with the same coactivator, SRC1.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	293	 SRC1 may serve both as a scaffolding molecule and an activator through its acetyltransferase activity.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Which of these functions is required seems to be determined by the local promoter environment to which SRC1 is recruited.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Furthermore, the function of SRC1 as a coactivator is not simply determined by the site of its recruitment to the GRU but also depends upon activation by GR.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	296	 This role of recruitment and activation of coactivators may have implications for other genes that employ AFs to mediate responses to metabolic signals.
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Indeed, the AFs required for the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene are involved in regulating the hormone responses of many genes that encode enzymes required for metabolic homeostasis (10-14, 68, 69).
0.32730934.11069927.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Thus, the functional interactions between HNF3 and HNF4 with SRC1, as described in the PEPCK gene GRU, may have a broad role in metabolic adaptation.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	4	The TR4 orphan receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates gene expression via binding to the AGGTCA direct repeat hormone response element.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here we report a functional study of TR4 interaction with the core promoter of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that TR4 can bind to the direct repeat 1 sequence element (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769, TR4RE-HBV) on the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	7	 TR4 also can enhance the activity of a synthetic luciferase reporter linked with four copies of TR4RE-HBV in either liver HepG2 or non-liver H1299 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Surprisingly, TR4 represses the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the entire HBV genome sequences.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, mutation of this TR4RE-HBV site in the HBV core promoter diminishes the TR4 suppression effect.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This TR4-induced suppression of HBV core promoter activity is further confirmed by primer extension analysis of the HBV core RNAs, showing that TR4 represses both pre-core and core mRNAs.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Further dissection of this repressive mechanism indicates that TR4 may suppress the HBV core promoter activity via repressing HNF4-mediated transactivation by protein-protein interactions without inhibition of HNF4 DNA binding.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, our results indicate that the N- and C-terminal regions of TR4 protein are required for TR4-HNF4 interaction.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	13	 It is possible that TR4-HNF4 interaction may block the HNF4 function that results in the suppression of HBV gene expression.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Together, these results demonstrate that TR4 can serve as a negative modulator in the transcriptional regulation of HBV core gene expression.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	15	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	16	Hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 is a small virus with a 3.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	18	 HBV is a major pathogen causing acute and chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (3, 4).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	19	 HBV transcripts are regulated by the transcriptional control of four different promoters and two enhancer elements (5).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	20	 HBV is replicated from a RNA intermediate as a template for reverse transcription (1).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The core promoter controls the expression of the 3.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	22	5-kb core mRNA (C mRNA) as the template for replication, and the expression of the pre-core mRNA (pre-C mRNA) for the translation of the HBeAg precursor (6).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Recently, multiple binding sites for liver-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors and several hormone response elements (HRE) have been identified in the core promoter region, including Sp1 (7, 8), TATA-binding protein (9), HNF3 (10), HNF4 (11), C/EBP (12), and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as the retinoid X receptor (RXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), COUP-TF1, and ARP1 (13).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For example, HNF4 and RXR/PPAR can stimulate the expression of the 3.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	25	5-kb core RNA, COUP-TF1 suppresses the expression of both the pre-C RNA and C RNA, and TR2 preferentially represses the expression of the pre-C RNA (14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors may play important roles in viral transcription.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The detailed mechanisms of how the core promoter is differentially regulated by these nuclear receptors remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	28	The testicular orphan receptor 4 (TR4) (NR2C2) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (15-17).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This family includes classic steroid hormone receptors, the thyroid hormone receptor, the retinoid receptors, and many nuclear orphan receptors whose physiological ligands have not been identified (18).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Members of this superfamily typically contain two major conserved domains, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (18).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Most nuclear receptors bind to their cognate ligands, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to the specific HREs to turn on their downstream target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	32	 TR4 was isolated from human prostate and testis cDNA libraries and is considered to be an orphan receptor, because its ligand has not been found (15).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our previous data showed that TR4 recognizes different AGGTCA direct repeat (DR) sequences either inducing or suppressing its target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	34	 For example, TR4 induces reporters containing the DR1 site of human ciliary neurotrophic factor  receptor promoter and the DR4 site of the -myosin heavy chain promoter (19, 20).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In contrast, TR4 suppresses RXR/retinoic acid receptor (DR1), vitamin D3 receptor (DR3), and RXR/PPAR (DR1)-mediated transactivation as shown by the reporter assay (21-23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These results suggest that TR4 may act as a negative regulator of its target genes containing hormone response elements (HREs) by competition with other nuclear receptors for binding to the HREs (21, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In addition, our previous data showed that TR4 could also suppress androgen receptor-mediated transactivation via protein-protein interaction (22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	38	The distribution of TR4 expression is ubiquitous in many tissues, including the central nervous system, adrenal gland, spleen, thyroid gland, and liver (16, 19, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Also, there are many other nuclear receptors expressed in the liver, such as HNF4 (24) and RXR/PPAR (25, 26).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These findings suggest that these nuclear receptors in the liver can coordinately regulate gene expression by interacting with HRE sequences in the promoters of their target genes.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Our data show that TR4 can interfere with a number of other nuclear receptors by competing for binding to the same HREs (21, 22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	42	In this report, we have analyzed the DR1 site in the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We tested whether the TR4 plays a role in regulating the activity of the core promoter through binding to the HRE-DR1 site.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We showed that TR4 binds to the DR1 site in the HBV core promoter and strongly activates a reporter containing synthetic DR1 response elements.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Moreover, we demonstrated that TR4 could suppress both pre-C and C RNA expression, which was also confirmed by the luciferase assay using a reporter containing the entire core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Our data further suggest that TR4 may suppress HBV core promoter activity via the interruption of HNF4-induced HBV core promoter by protein-protein interaction with HNF4.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These data demonstrate that TR4 can function as a repressor in liver cells to suppress HBV gene expression and replication.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	93	TR4 Protein Binds Specifically to the TR4RE-HBV Consensus Site of the HBV Core Promoter-- Previous studies showed that the activity of the HBV core promoter could be differentially regulated by RXR or PPAR via recognizing consensus binding sites on the HBV core promoter (13, 14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Our previous data also showed that the TR4 has a better affinity than RXR to recognize the DR1-HRE in the promoter of the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene (21).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	95	 To examine whether TR4 can bind to the potential DR1-HRE (named TR4RE-HBV, nucleotide coordinates 1751-1778 of the HBV ayw DNA sequence) on the HBV core promoter (13), the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with in vitro translated TR4 protein, using radiolabeled TR4RE-HBV oligonucleotides as probes.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	222	 One such site (TGAACCTTTACCC, nucleotide coordinates 1138-1150), is located in the core domain of enhancer I and is recognized by HNF4, COUP-TF1, and RXR-PPAR (37).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The other site (AGGTTAAAGGTCT, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769) is located in the core promoter that can be recognized by HNF4 and TR4 as described in current studies (13).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	224	 The detailed mechanisms of how these nuclear receptors modulate HBV gene expression via these two DR1 sites remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Our data strongly suggest that TR4 preferentially binds the DR1 site of the core promoter, because TR4 suppression is abrogated if this site is mutated (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The selective binding of TR4 to the 2nd DR1 site may be a key step for TR4 to prevent other nuclear receptors from binding to this site, thereby repressing transcription.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	227	 However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TR4 may also regulate HBV gene expression through the DR1 site of enhancer I, because our data indicate that TR4 can recognize this site (data not shown).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Moreover, because TR4 binding to the 2nd DR1 site is prevented by two mutations ((1756 (A to T) and 1767 (G to A)), which are frequently found in patients with chronic hepatitis, one may speculate that HBV may utilize these two mutations to escape suppression mediated by TR4 and/or other transcriptional repressors.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Alternatively, creation of new mutations at these consensus DR1 sites may be able to increase the opportunity for other modulators to regulate HBV expression via these mutated DR1 sites (32).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	230	TR4 is highly homologous with another orphan receptor, TR2 (15).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Earlier studies indicated that TR2 and TR4 could modulate the expression of a set of genes through binding to the same HREs (19, 38).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	232	 (14) reported that TR2 could only repress pre-C RNA, but not C RNA expression.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Our current data show that TR4 can repress both pre-C RNA and C RNA expression.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Moreover, compared with the marginal suppression of TR2 on CpLuc reporter activity, TR4 has a much stronger suppressive effect on CpLuc reporter activity (data not shown), suggesting that TR4 may play a significant role in this regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Also, our data suggest that simple competition for binding to the DR1 site by these two nuclear receptors may not fully account for their distinct regulation of HBV core gene expression, because both nuclear receptors regulate target genes through binding to the DR sites (19, 38).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The detailed mechanisms underlying the distinct regulation of HBV gene expression by these two closely related orphan receptors remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The interaction of TR4 and HNF4 suggests that the TR4 affects HBV gene expression at multiple levels, most importantly, including the DNA binding and protein-protein interactions.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Nevertheless, previous reports also suggested that COUP-TF could differentially modulate target gene expression via similar HREs.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	239	 For example, COUP-TF1 can induce the 7-hydroxylase promoter activity via the DR4 binding site and repress myosin heavy chain promoter activity via a similar DR4 binding site (39).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Similar differential modulation of target gene expression also occurred with TR4, via binding to similar DR1 binding sites (21, 23).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	241	The contrasting effects of TR4 on the synthetic TR4RE-HBV versus the entire HBV promoter (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	242	 3 versus 4) suggest that promoter context, especially sequences other than the TR4RE-HBV, may also play important roles for TR4 to modulate HBV core promoter activity.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	243	 It is possible that sequences flanking the TR4RE-HBV may recruit one or more repressors that can cooperate with TR4 to form a protein complex to repress HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	244	 In addition, we have examined the effects of TR4 on HBV core promoter activity in non-liver cells and found that TR4 was able to induce the luciferase activity of the Cpluc reporter in H1299 cells (data not shown).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	245	 This interesting finding implies that some cellular factors in liver cells may modulate the transcriptional activity of TR4 in the regulation of the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, the detailed mechanisms of this distinct regulation by TR4 remain unclear.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	247	TR4 may modulate its target gene expression via two distinct mechanisms.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	248	 First, TR4 can suppress target gene expression via competition with other nuclear receptors, such as RXR (DR1), VDR (DR3), and retinoic acid receptor  (DR5), for the same consensus HRE sites (21, 22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Previous studies showed that ligand-activated RXR/PPAR or PPAR can increase HBV core promoter activity through the TR4RE-HBV site (DR1) (13, 14).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Therefore, it appears that TR4 may compete for the same binding site with these nuclear receptors resulting in repression of HBV core promoter activity, which this regulation does not involve in any interaction between TR4 and other nuclear receptors (21, 22).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Second, TR4 can also modulate gene expression via protein-protein interactions with other nuclear receptors.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	252	 For example, TR4 can suppress androgen target genes through interactions with the androgen receptor (40).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	253	 In the current study, we found TR4 cannot only bind to the same DR1 site on HBV core promoter as HNF4 (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	254	 5), but also interact with HNF4 (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The TR4-mediated repression resulted from this interaction was confirmed by using TR4 deletion mutants in several parallel experiments and may further support that there might be multiple mechanisms by which TR4 proceeds in this repressive regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Previous studies showed that TR2, a close member of TR4 family, and RIP140 (receptor-interacting protein 140), one of TR4-interacting proteins, can interact and recruit histone deacetylases for gene silencing (22, 41, 42).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	257	 It is possible that TR4 may carry out this repression through similar mechanisms, which would be an interesting direction for our future study to test the involvement of histone deacetylases in this regulation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	258	On the other hand, in HBV-infected liver cells, the repressive function of TR4 may be unfavorable to the HBV replication because the core promoter controls the transcription of the template C RNA for viral DNA synthesis.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	259	 We speculate that the functional association of TR4 and HNF4 could be a unique way to relieve TR4-mediated repression, because HNF can reduce TR4 binding to the DR1 site through either competition for DNA binding or protein-protein interactions (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The underlying mechanisms of how these nuclear receptors differentially influence the transcription activation of HBV genes during infection will require more extensive study.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	261	 8, TR4 can directly bind to the TR4RE-HBV and therefore prevent other nuclear receptors from activating the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Alternatively, TR4 can interact with nuclear receptors, such as HNF4, to form an inactive protein complex.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Either of these two activities may result in the suppression of HBV core promoter.

0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	266	 This figure depicts a simple model of the HBV core promoter and the regulation of this promoter via TR4RE-HBV by TR4.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	267	 A, The binding of TR4 to the TR4RE may restrict the accessibility of this site to other essential nuclear receptors for transcriptional activation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Also, the interaction of HNF4 and TR4 inhibits HNF4 transcriptional activity and results in the suppression of the HBV core promoter activity.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	269	 B, during natural infection, by an unknown mechanism, the interaction of HNF4 and 2R4 may prevent TR4 from binding to the DR1 site (Fig.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Therefore, this regulation can relieve TR4-mediated repression and allow HNF4 or other nuclear receptors to proceed to the transcriptional activation.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	271	In conclusion, this study provides evidence that TR4 is a transcriptional repressor of the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The interaction of TR4 and HNF4 further extends the scope of nuclear receptor regulation of the HBV core promoter.
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	273	 The transcriptional activation of the core promoter is a key step to initiate the life cycle of HBV during the infection (34).
0.40115005.12522137.html.plaintext.txt	274	 By identifying of physiological ligand(s) for TR4, we may be able to control agonist or antagonist binding to TR4 to modulate HBV gene expression, which may provide a novel strategy to develop anti-HBV drugs.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Rifampicin inhibited CYP7A1 reporter activity and a PXR binding site was localized to the bile acid response element-I.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mammalian two-hybrid assays revealed that PXR interacted with hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4, NR2A1) and rifampicin was required.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	11	 PXR also interacted with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator (PGC-1), which interacted with HNF4 and induced CYP7A1 gene transcription.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1 bound to CYP7A1 chromatin, and rifampicin dissociated PGC-1 from chromatin.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This tightly regulated feedback mechanism is necessary because bile acids are highly toxic and cholesterol is needed for maintaining cellular structure and function.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Recent studies (4) have revealed that bile acid feedback has far-reaching impacts on liver metabolism; it not only regulates bile acid synthesis in the digestive system but also regulates cholesterol, lipoprotein, triglyceride, and glucose metabolisms.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The discovery that lithocholic acid (LCA) is an endogenous ligand for pregnane X receptor (PXR) suggests that bile acids may also regulate drug metabolism in the liver and intestine by induction of CYP450 enzymes (27, 34).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	21	 PXR and its human ortholog steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) induce the CYP3A, CYP2B, and CYP2C families of steroid- and drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and intestine (17).

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These results suggest that PXR may mediate LCA and PCN inhibition of mouse Cyp7a1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	28	 It was proposed that activation of PXR by drugs and bile acids might protect the liver against drug and bile acid-induced cholestasis (27, 34).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	29	Our previous studies identified two bile acid response elements (BAREs): BARE-I and BARE-II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These two BAREs are essential for basal transcriptional activity and also for conferring bile acid feedback inhibition (reviewed in Ref.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	31	 They contain several AGGTCA-like repeating sequences, which are potential binding sites for nuclear receptors.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A direct repeat spaced by four bases (DR4) in the rat BARE-I is a binding site for an orphan receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor-II (COUP-TFII; NR2F2) and also for liver orphan receptor (LXR; NR1H3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, COUP-TFII and LXR do not bind to the human BARE-I due to the lack of a DR4 motif (5).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The factor that binds to the human BARE-I has not been identified.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The BARE-II contains an 18-bp sequence that is completely conserved in rats and humans.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)4 binds to a DR1, and human -fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF; NR5A2) or mouse liver-related homolog (LRH) binds to an overlapping half-site sequence in the BARE-II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	37	 HNF4 is the only nuclear receptor that is able to stimulate the human CYP7A1 gene; all other factors tested (FTF, COUP-TFII, LXR) inhibited the human CYP7A1 gene (2, 5, 29).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	38	Bile acids are known to activate nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4), which binds to the inverted repeat (IR1) sequences and induces several genes involved in lipid metabolism (reviewed in Ref.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, FXR inhibits the CYP7A1 gene by inducing a negative receptor, small heterodimer partnet (SHP), which interacts with FTF and inhibits its transactivation of the CYP7A1 gene (3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The FXR/SHP/FTF mechanism is consistent with lacking inhibition of Cyp7a1 and induction of Shp mRNA expression in Fxr null mice fed with bile acids (26).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, bile acid feeding still inhibits Cyp7a1 expression in Shp null mice (15, 33), suggesting that mechanisms alternative to the FXR/SHP/FTF pathway must exist for bile acids to inhibit Cyp7a1 mRNA expression in Shp null mice (33).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The alternative mechanisms include the cytokine/MAPK/JNK pathway, protein kinase C/cJun pathway, FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 pathway, and the PXR-mediated pathway (4).

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	296	 PGC-1 was originally identified as a coactivator of PPAR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Since then, several other nuclear receptors including HNF4, LXR, RXR, and Estrogen receptor (ER), and ER-related receptor were found to interact with PGC-1 and regulate gluconeogenesis and energy metabolism (23, 25).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	298	 It is not known whether PGC-1 interacts with PXR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	299	 We therefore performed mammalian two-hybrid assays to study PXR interaction with PGC-1.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Because coactivator is known to interact with nuclear receptor by binding to the LBD and ligand enhances the interaction, we then studied the effect of rifampicin on PXR interaction with HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Figure 6B shows that rifampicin induced a fourfold stimulation of PXR and PGC-1 interaction.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Interestingly, overexpression of HNF4 strongly inhibited PXR and PGC-1 interaction only when a PXR ligand was added.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	305	 This indicates that rifampicin promotes PXR and HNF4 interaction and excludes PGC-1 from interaction with PXR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Figure 6C shows that Gal4-PGC-1 interacts strongly with VP-16-HNF4 (500-fold), and rifampicin did not have any effect on the interaction.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	307	 This is expected because rifampicin is not a ligand of HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	308	 When PXR expression plasmid was cotransfected, addition of rifampicin strongly inhibited HNF4 and PGC-1 interaction.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Because PGC-1 is a coactivator that lacks a DBD, PGC-1 must interact with either HNF4 and/or PXR in the CYP7A1 chromatin.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	378	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION GRANTS REFERENCES   In this report, we studied the mechanism of rifampicin and PXR inhibition of human CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	379	 We established the human primary hepatocyte as a suitable model for studying CYP7A1 gene regulation by nuclear receptors and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Q-PCR analysis reveals that CYP7A1 mRNA expression levels are repressed in human primary hepatocytes, likely because the negative effects of several negative regulators of the human CYP7A1 gene, FTF, COUP-TFII, PXR, Prox1 (see below), and SHP, may dominant over the positive effect of activators HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Q-PCR analysis showed that CDCA strongly reduced CYP7A1 but induced SHP mRNA expression in human primary hepatocytes.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	382	 This inverse relationship of CDCA effect on CYP7A1 and SHP expression is consistent with the FXR/SHP mechanism of bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	383	 In contrast, rifampicin strongly reduced both CYP7A1 and SHP mRNA expression in human primary hepatocytes.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	384	 This result provides strong evidence that SHP is not involved in PXR inhibition of CYP7A1 because reduction of a negative factor should result in induction of CYP7A1 expression.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	385	 Our preliminary results show that rifampicin-activated PXR inhibits human SHP reporter activity (data not shown).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	386	In bile acid or drug-induced cholestasis, PXR may be activated to induce CYP3A4, which catalyzes 6-hydroxylation of bile acids for renal excretion.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	387	 PXR also induces dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase that excretes sulfate-conjugated bile acids.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Our findings suggest that PXR inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription may be an additional mechanism for reducing intrahepatic bile acid concentrations and further protect the liver from toxic effects of bile acids and xenobiotics.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	389	 PXR inhibition of SHP may also be a part of the PXR protection mechanism, because SHP could interact with PXR to inhibit CYP3A4 induction (22).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	390	Our cell-based mammalian two-hybrid assay, co-IP, and ChIP assays all confirm the interactions of PXR with HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	391	 The interaction between PXR and HNF4 is novel and is consistent with our model that factors bound to the BARE-I and BARE-II interact and coordinately regulate basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene (8).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	392	 HNF4 is known to play a central role in regulation of bile acid synthesis (3).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	393	 There are reports that HNF4 is required for PXR-mediated xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4 in mice (31) and that HNF4 regulates PXR expression and xenobiotic response during fetal liver development (14).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	394	 Therefore, the PXR and HNF4 interaction may be physiologically important in the coordinated regulation of xenobiotic and bile acid metabolisms.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	395	 Both two-hybrid assay and co-IP assay using HepG2 and primary hepatocyte extracts show that rifampicin markedly enhances PXR interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	396	 The interaction between PXR and PGC-1 is as strong as between HNF4 and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	397	 This is the first report that PXR is a target of PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Rifampicin is not required for PXR to interact with PGC-1 and does not affect HNF4 and PXR binding to CYP7A1 chromatin.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	399	 On the other hand, rifampicin dissociates PGC-1 from CYP7A1 chromatin likely due to enhancing PXR interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	400	Our results suggest a model for PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1 regulation of the CYP7A1 gene (Fig.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	401	 HNF4 and PGC-1 are the most important transactivators of the human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	402	 PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and activates human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	403	 According to this study, PXR binds to the BARE-I and interacts with PGC-1 but may not be important in basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	404	 It should be noted that our model does not suggest a ternary complex formation among PXR, HNF4, and PGC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	405	 PGC-1 is a coactivator that binds to the LBD of both PXR and HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Therefore, it is not likely that PGC-1 interacts simultaneously with both nuclear receptors.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	407	 Ubiquitous coactivators, SRC-1 and CBP, are known to interact with PXR and HNF4; however, our data show a much stronger interaction of PXR with PGC-1 than SRC-1.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	408	 Nuclear receptor/coactivator complexes may facilitate the recruitment of histone acetytransferase to remodel the chromatin to allow recruitment of other coactivator/mediator complexes and assemble the general transcriptional machinery that regulates RNA polymerase II activity (10).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	409	 On the basis of our results, we propose a model that activation of PXR by rifampicin would allow PXR to interact directly with HNF4 and exclude PGC-1 from interacting with HNF4, resulting in suppression of the CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Corepressors, such as SMRT and NCoR1, have been shown to inhibit nuclear receptor activity (7).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Our preliminary results show that the interaction of SMRT and NCoR1 with HNF4 and PXR is very weak.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	412	 It is also possible that rifampicin-activated PXR may compete with HNF4 for PGC-1, thus inhibiting CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	413	 This mechanism of PXR inhibition of gene transcription is not likely because PGC-1 interaction with PXR or HNF4 does not require a ligand and rifampicin-activated PXR and HNF4 is known to strongly induce, not inhibit, CYP3A4 gene transcription.

0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Top: HNF4 and PGC-1 are the most important activators of human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	417	 PGC-1 interacts with HNF4, which binds to the BARE-II and transactivates the human CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	418	 According to this study, PXR is able to bind to the BARE-I.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Coactivators SRC-1 and cAMP response element binding protein binding protein (CBP) and histone acetytransferase (HAT) may be also recruited to remodel chromatin and recruit other coactivator complexes to induce the basal transcription of the CYP7A1 gene by RNA polymerase II.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Bottom: rifampicin activates PXR to promote its interaction with HNF4.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	421	 This interaction may disrupt the interaction between PGC-1 and HNF4 (and may be also PXR) and result in suppression of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Corepressors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) may be also recruited to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	423	  Very recently, a homeobox transcription factor, Prox1, has been shown to interact specifically with FTF and inhibits the CYP7A1 gene (24).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Prox1 is expressed in the liver and intestine and may play an important role not only in liver development, but also in regulation of bile acid synthesis.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Our Q-PCR analysis detects very high levels of Prox1 mRNA in human primary hepatocytes, indicating that Prox1 might be the dominant repressor of CYP7A1 gene expression in human livers.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	426	 However, it is not known whether bile acids or drugs affect Prox1 interaction with FTF, HNF4, or PXR.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Another recent report (28) shows that Prox1 interacts with FTF and inhibits SHP gene expression and that Prox1 specifically interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC)3.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	428	 HDACs are known to form complexes with nuclear receptors and corepressors and inhibit gene transcription (13).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	429	 The roles of these transcriptional repressors in mediating bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription remain to be elucidated.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	430	In summary, this study provides the first evidence that PXR is able to interact with HNF4 and PGC-1 and plays a role in mediating rifampicin and bile acid inhibition of CYP7A1 gene transcription.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	431	 On ligand binding, PXR interacts with HNF4, blocks PGC-1 interaction with HNF4, and results in inhibition of the CYP7A1 gene.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	432	 The PXR pathway may be important for preventing bile acid and drug-induced cholestasis by inhibiting bile acid synthesis as well as stimulating bile acid transport, excretion, and detoxification.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Thus PXR plays a central role in coordinated regulation of bile acid homeostasis and drug metabolism.
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	434	 This may be the mechanism for using rifampicin and steroids to treat pruritus of intrahepatic cholestasis and primary biliary cirrhosis (1, 12).
0.40663978.15331348.html.plaintext.txt	435	 Efficacious PXR agonists may be developed for treating these chronic liver diseases.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Tangential migration has been shown to contribute significantly to the generation of neuronal diversity in the mammalian telencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	6	 GABAergic interneurons are the best-characterized neurons that migrate tangentially, from the ventral telencephalon, dorsally into the cortex.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	7	 However, the molecular mechanisms and nature of these migratory pathways are only just beginning to be unravelled.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In this study we have first identified a novel dorsal-to-ventral migratory route, in which cells migrate from the interganglionic sulcus, located in the basal telencephalon between the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences, towards the pre-optic area and anterior hypothalamus in the diencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Next, with the help of transplantations and gain-of-function studies in organotypic cultures, we have shown that COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are expressed in distinct and non-overlapping migratory routes.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Ectopic expression of COUP-TFs induces an increased rate of cell migration and cell dispersal, suggesting roles in cellular adhesion and migration processes.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Moreover, cells follow a distinct migratory path, dorsal versus ventral, which is dependent on the expression of COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII, suggesting an intrinsic role of COUP-TFs in guiding migrating neurons towards their target regions.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Therefore, we propose that COUP-TFs are directly involved in tangential cell migration in the developing brain, through the regulation of short- and long-range guidance cues.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	13	Key words: COUP-TFs, Cell migration, Forebrain, Mouse.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	14	   Introduction TOP SUMMARY Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion Conclusions REFERENCES   It is well recognized that both radial and tangential migration contribute significantly to neuronal diversity within the telencephalon (reviewed by Marin and Rubenstein, 2003).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Projection neurons originate in the ventricular zone of the cortical anlage (pallium) and migrate radially to form the developing cortex, while GABAergic interneurons originate in restricted regions of the ventricular zone of the subcortical telencephalon (subpallium) and migrate tangentially to reach their final destination, in defined telencephalic regions.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Within the subpallium, the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) appears to be the major source of cortical interneurons (Anderson et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, it has been shown in vivo that neurons that derive from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) contribute to the generation of projection neurons in the striatum and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, respectively (Nery et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although there is an overlap in the structures populated by neurons originating from all three ganglionic eminences (GEs), the nuclei derived from the progeny of each eminence are distinct and can vary in their neurochemical profiles (Nery et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	19	 As a further source of cellular diversity, the anterior entopeduncular area, which is located between the MGE and the hypothalamus, contributes to the generation of oligodendrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus (He et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Therefore, interneurons and oligodendrocytes appear to follow a mainly ventral-to-dorsal migratory route before reaching their target tissues, and it is not known whether these cells can also migrate in a dorsal-to-ventral direction.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The identification of other migratory pathways, such as the gangliothalamic body connecting the GEs with the thalamus (Letinic and Kostovic, 1997; Rakic and Sidman, 1969), and the rostral migratory stream between the LGE and the olfactory bulb (Altman, 1969; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Luskin, 1993), makes it plausible that the GEs generate neurons directed to other embryonic brain regions besides the dorsal telencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	22	As suggested by various studies, directional migration can be achieved by short-range guidance cues and by long-range diffusible gradients (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Contact guidance relies on a permissive environment, on which gradients of diffusible guidance molecules can be superimposed, to achieve directional migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, the distribution and molecular nature of short- and long-range molecules, and the substratum that interneurons use in their migration towards the cortex, are poorly understood.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Motogenic factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor and the neurotrophin molecules BDNF and NT4, have been shown to influence the numbers of cells migrating away from the subpallium (Polleux et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Guidance molecules with repulsive and attractive activities are likely to be involved in guiding migrating cells from the subpallium to the pallium, and within the subpallium (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	27	 For the substratum, one report has shown that blocking the function of the TAG1 adhesion molecule results in a marked reduction in GABAergic neurons in the cortex (Denaxa et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, in Tag1 mutant mice, there is no major alteration in the tangential migration of interneurons (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003), and treatment of cortical slices with phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins, such as TAG1, does not alter interneuron migration (Tanaka et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Therefore, nothing is known about the nature of short-range guidance contact cues involved in tangential migration.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Overexpression of COUP-TFI in retinoic-acid-treated neuronal aggregates coated with different cell substrata, such as polylysine, laminin or fibronectin, results in a higher rate of migration compared with controls, whereas overexpression of a mutated form of COUP-TFI has no effects on cell migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, increased levels of vitronectin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule involved in neurite extension, motor neuron differentiation and possibly neuronal migration, are detected both in aggregate and monolayer cell cultures after overexpression of COUP-TFI.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This, and the data that show that COUP-TFI stimulates transcription from the vitronectin promoter in vitro, strongly suggests a role of COUP-TFI in the regulation of ECM synthesis during the process of neuronal migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Although COUP-TFI has been shown to be involved in cortical regionalization and axon pathfinding in the developing telencephalon (Zhou et al.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Moreover, expression of COUP-TFI in the cortex co-localizes with the GABAergic marker calbindin, suggesting that a subpopulation of COUP-TFI-positive cells in the cortex are GABAergic interneurons.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We then demonstrate that COUP-TFI is expressed in the basal telencephalon in neurons not only migrating dorsally towards the cortex, but also ventrally towards the pre-optic area (POa) and the hypothalamus.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Finally, by ectopic expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in the GEs, we show an increased rate of migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	41	 While COUP-TFI appears to control dorsal and ventral migration in the basal telencephalon, COUP-TFII is more specific in modulating tangential migration into the intermediate zone of the cortex, suggesting distinct functions of COUP-TFs in regulating cell migration in the developing forebrain.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	257	 While radial migration uses the radial glia as a scaffold upon which cortical neurons migrate to the developing cortical plate, GABAergic interneurons originate in the GEs and use tangential migration to migrate over long distances to reach their destinations in the cortex (Marin and Rubenstein, 2003; Rakic, 1990).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	258	In this report, we have identified a novel migratory path, which to our knowledge has never been reported before.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Using grafting experiments, DNA electroporation and tracer injections, we have shown that cells located in the interganglionic region, where the MGE and LGE fuse together, have the capability of migrating ventrally towards the pre-optic and hypothalamic regions of the diencephalon (Figs 3, 4, 5).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	260	 As this path originates from the interganglionic region at specific caudal levels, it is very likely that it has been missed in other studies using similar approaches (Anderson et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	261	 The novelty of this path is twofold: first, cells migrate tangentially from dorsal to ventral, along the subventricular zone of the MGE, i.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	262	 in opposite directions with respect to the MGE-derived cortical interneurons; and second, these cells exit the basal telencephalon and migrate into the basal diencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	263	 These cells are different from the gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons, which originate in the olfactory placode and migrate along the vomeronasal nerve fibres until they reach the POa and hypothalamus (Wray et al.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	265	 With the help of retroviral cell tracing, Marin and collaborators (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	266	, 2000) have shown that cells emanating from the MGE and the adjacent POa/anterior entopeduncular area express the transcription factor Nkx2.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	270	Furthermore, we have shown that cells originating from the CGE migrate via different streams into the basal diencephalon, and in particular into the hypothalamus (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	271	 As opposed to the MLGE transplant, in which the stream of ventrally migrating cells is quite compact, cells migrating out of the CGE take a medial and latero-ventral route.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	272	 We do not know the fate of these ventrally migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	273	 In-vivo ultrasound-guided labelling or transplantation (Nery et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	274	, 2001), in which total cortices are manipulated in toto and characterized at later stages, would help us to understand the final destinies of these migrating cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	275	Is the basal telencephalon only chemorepulsive? Transplantation experiments and co-culture assays have shown that the POa and hypothalamic regions prevent interneurons from migrating in a ventral direction by secreting repulsive molecules that are responsible for the dorsal migration of interneurons towards the cortex (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	276	 However, the cues mediating this action have not been identified yet.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Here, we show that cells originating from more dorsal and caudal regions are capable of migrating ventrally towards the POa/anterior hypothalamus.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	278	 How do we reconcile these different results? First, the previous studies showed that the majority of interneurons that originated from the MGE avoided migrating in ventral directions.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	279	 This is what is expected for a circumscribed graft in a section where the two GEs are well separated (Marin et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	280	 However, the dorsal-to-ventral cell migration that we describe in this report originates from a restricted region, the interganglionic sulcus, at more caudal levels.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	281	 It is plausible that in order to follow the migration that originates in the MGE and LGE, this region was not included in other studies.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	282	 Therefore, we hypothesize that cells originating from different rostrocaudal levels can have different responses to the same environment by expressing position-dependent receptors.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Accordingly, COUP-TFs are not expressed in ventrally migrating cells at more rostral levels, where the two GEs are well separated (data not shown).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Thus, the POa and hypothalamus can have different roles, repulsion versus attraction, according to the type of cells they encounter.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	285	A novel role for COUP-TFs in neuronal migration in the developing forebrain COUP-TFs are orphan nuclear receptors of the steroid/thyroid superfamily shown to be involved in neurogenesis, axogenesis and neural differentiation (Park et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	286	 In the cortex, COUP-TFI is mainly known for its role in regionalization and in guidance of thalamocortical projections (Zhou et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	287	, 2001), whereas COUP-TFII is a fundamental player in angiogenesis and heart development (Pereira et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	288	 In this report, we have provided the first insights into the functional roles of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII in neuronal migration in vivo.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In a previous report, it was shown that COUP-TFI could regulate cell adhesion mechanisms required for the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells (Adam et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Because of the substrates on which cells were plated, it was suggested that COUP-TFI could modify the synthesis of ECM molecules, making cells autonomous for migration and spreading.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Our expression data in vivo and our functional data in organotypic cultures support these results in a context in which cell migration assumes a fundamental role in achieving neuronal diversity.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	292	 By using these different approaches, we have first shown expression of COUP-TFs in highly motile neurons, such as GABAergic and reelin-positive cells (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	293	 2); we have then confirmed the co-localization of COUP-TFI in migrating neurons in a series of grafting experiments (Figs 3, 4, 5); and finally, we have directly demonstrated a role of COUP-TFs in modulating cell migration in a gain-of-function approach (Figs 6, 7).
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Our data also demonstrate that COUP-TFs can control directional migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Indeed, cells expressing higher levels of COUP-TFs (and thus GFP) not only tend to spread and lose their aspect of aggregates, but also follow specific migratory pathways (dorsal and/or ventral) that are intrinsic to cells expressing COUP-TFs (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	296	Therefore, we hypothesize a dual role for COUP-TFs.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	297	 First, they should regulate short-range cues, such as ECM and/or adhesive molecules, and in this way modulate the neighbouring environment.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	298	 Changes in a permissive environment would allow random dispersion of migratory cells.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Indeed, in the absence of COUP-TFI, GABAergic cells do migrate into the cortex, although in a less organised fashion than in the normal situation (M.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Therefore, we favour the hypothesis that COUP-TFI is involved in modulating cell migration, more than inducing cells to initiate migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	301	Second, we propose that COUP-TFs control diffusible guidance molecules, and/or their receptors, involved in cell migration.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Indeed, ectopic expression of COUP-TFI led to the correct directional migration of the targeted cells, i.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	303	 dorsal into the cortex and ventral into the POa (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	304	 6D), suggesting that cells over- or mis-expressing COUP-TFI were able to respond to COUP-TFI-dependent guidance cues.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	305	 More striking is the behaviour of MGE-migrating cells after mis-expression of COUP-TFII.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	306	 In this case, neurons that were committed to migrate into the marginal and intermediate layers of the neocortex (see control in Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	307	 7C) migrated at higher rates solely into the intermediate layer, avoiding specifically the marginal layer (Fig.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	308	 7D), suggesting that COUP-TFII regulates guidance cues required for migration into the intermediate zone of the neocortex.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This behaviour is in accordance with the COUP-TFII expression pattern and the grafting experiments described in this study.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Indeed, COUP-TFII-positive cells in the marginal zone are Cajal-Retzius cells, as seen by the co-expression with reelin, and it is now well established that Cajal-Retzius cells originate exclusively from the pallium (Hevner et al.

0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	313	 COUP-TFI has previously been reported to be required in axon guidance in the telencephalon and romboencephalon (Qiu et al.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Here, we show that COUP-TFs are involved in modulating the rates and directions of tangentially migrating cells from the basal telencephalon to the cortex, and from the basal telencephalon to the basal diencephalon.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Interestingly, the cells follow a migratory path that is dependent on the expression of COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, suggesting an intrinsic role for COUP-TFs in guiding migrating cells towards their target region.
0.31626305.15548577.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Finally, we speculate that COUP-TFs are regulators of a series of factors, such as short-range, non-diffusible contact guidance cues and long-range, diffusible guidance cues.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrate that COUP-TFI binds to the  to 129/ to 114 element (Ad5) of human CYP11B2 promoter.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Transient transfection in H295R adrenal cells demonstrated that COUP-TFI enhanced CYP11B2 reporter activity.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, the reporter construct with mutated Ad5 sequences showed reduced basal and COUP-TFI-enhanced activity, suggesting that binding of COUP-TFI to Ad5 is important for CYP11B2 transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To elucidate molecular mechanisms of COUP-TFI-mediated activity, we subsequently screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenal cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 and PIAS1, which have small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1) conjugase and ligase activities, respectively.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that COUP-TFI forms a complex with Ubc9 and PIAS1 in mammalian cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Immunohistochemistry showed that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are markedly expressed in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated CYP11B2 reporter activity, indicating that both proteins function as coactivators of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, sumoylation-defective mutants, Ubc9 (C93S) and PIAS1 (C351S), continued to function as coactivators of COUP-TFI, indicating that sumoylation activity are separable from coactivator ability.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that ectopically expressed COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Moreover, reduction of Ubc9 or PIAS1 protein levels by small interfering RNA inhibited the CYP11B2 transactivation by COUP-TFI.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Although the reason for aberrant expression of CYP11B2 in these adenomas is not known, mutations in the CYP11B2 gene do not appear to be the cause (3, 4).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We therefore postulated that transcription factors and/or coregulators may play important roles in CYP11B2 overexpression in the tumors.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	19	The trans-acting factors that regulate CYP11B2 expression remain poorly defined.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1),1 is shown to play a crucial regulator of most steroid hydroxylase genes, including CYP17 and CYP11B1 (5, 6).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, SF-1 actually represses rather than activates expression of hCYP11B2 (7 to 9).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, other transcription factors that are expressed in the adrenal cortex include the NGFI-B family of orphan nuclear receptors, such as Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	24	 These three nuclear receptors are rapidly induced early response genes that enhance transcription by binding to a consensus sequence, named NBRE-1, as well as an Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition, CREB and ATF-1 enhance transcription of the hCYP11B2 gene by binding to a CRE (9, 12, 13).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Our previous data (12) showed that human adrenocortical H295R nuclear proteins containing chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) were bound to the  to 129/ to 114 sequence, designated as the Ad5 element of the hCYP11B2 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The COUP-TFI was originally identified as an activator of the chicken ovalbumin gene (14, 15); however, COUP-TFs mostly function as transcriptional repressor of many target genes.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	28	 COUP-TFs inhibit the transcription of other nuclear receptor such as retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (14).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Furthermore, COUP-TFI represses basal transcriptional activity by active repression utilizing transcriptional corepressors, such as N-CoR and SMRT (16).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We and other investigators have previously demonstrated that COUP-TFI and SF-1 regulate the bovine CYP17 expression in a mutually exclusive manner (17, 18).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We have previously reported that COUP-TFI is expressed in the normal adrenal cortex and that expression levels of COUP-TFI is inversely correlated with those of CYP17, but correlated with those of N-CoR in adrenal cortical adenomas (18 to 23).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	32	We, therefore, have screened COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a human adrenocortical adenoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified Ubc9 (24) and PIAS1, which are small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1)-conjugating enzyme and SUMO-1 ligase, respectively.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The SUMO post-translationally modifies many proteins with roles in diverse processes, including regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, and DNA repair (25 to 30).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The SUMO modification has not been generally associated with increased protein degradation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Rather, similar to non-proteolytic roles of ubiquitin, SUMO modification regulates protein localization and activity.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The SUMO E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3-ligase are involved in the sumoylation machinery.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In contrast to the ubiquitin system where dozens of E2 enzymes have been identified, Ubc9 is the only known SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Several SUMO-E3 ligases have been identified that promote transfer of SUMO from E2 to specific substrates.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To date, three unrelated proteins have been suggested to have SUMO-E3 ligase activity; the protein inhibitors of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) proteins (31 to 33), RanBP2 (34, 35), and polycomb group protein Pc2 (36).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The present study described that both Ubc9 and PIAS1 can function as transcriptional coactivators of COUP-TFI for the hCYP11B2 gene transcription in a sumoylation-independent manner.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	41	 These proteins are shown to form a complex in the nucleus and exhibit a very unique localization in the adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We demonstrated here that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 are recruited to an endogenous CYP11B2 promoter, thus contributing to aldosterone biosynthesis in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	311	 We detected that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 form a complex in the nuclei of mammalian cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Expression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 was markedly detected in rat adrenal zona glomerulosa cells, in which CYP11B2 is exclusively expressed.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Transient transfection assays together with small interfering RNA and ChIP assays indicated a physiological role of Ubc9 and PIAS1 in COUP-TFI-dependent transactivation of the human CYP11B2 gene in normal adrenal glomerulosa cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Both Ubc9 and PIAS1 have SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme (E2) and SUMO-1 ligase (E3) activity, respectively (25 to 30).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The C93S substitution of Ubc9 and the C351S substitution of PIAS1, which abrogate sumoylation activity, continued to interact with COUP-TFI and to potentiate transcriptional activation mediated by COUP-TFI, indicating that their sumoylation enzyme activities are not required for function as coactivators of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	316	Ubc9 and PIAS1 Function as Transcriptional Coactivators of COUP-TFI in CYP11B2 Transcription Both Ubc9 and PIAS1 meet all the criteria for transcriptional coactivator proteins in the modulation of COUP-TFI transcriptional properties.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	317	 2 and 3, Ubc9 and PIAS1 specifically interacted with COUP-TFI in yeast and mammalian cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	318	 The Ubc9 was previously shown to interact with the C-terminal putative ligand-binding domain of COUP-TFI-(388 to 403) that is described as a transcriptional repressor domain (24).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	319	 The present study showed that PIAS1 interacted with the DNA-binding domain and hinge region of COUP-TFI-(86 to 183).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Coimmunoprecipitation and subcellular localization experiments showed that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are colocalized with COUP-TFI in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	321	 These findings suggest that Ubc9 and PIAS1 specifically interact with COUP-TFI and form a complex in mammalian cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Second, overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 had no effect on the reporter activities in the absence of transfected COU-TFI (Fig.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	323	 However, Ubc9 or PIAS1 potentiated the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Subsequently, coexpression of the Ubc9 or PIAS1 deletion mutant, Ubc9-(1 to 58) or PIAS1-(1 to 150), which impairs COUP-TFI binding, did not affect the transactivation mediated by COUP-TFI, indicating that interaction of COUP-TFI with Ubc9 or PIAS1 is required for COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	325	 In addition, coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced the COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Third, reduction of endogenous Ubc9 or PIAS1 by small interfering RNA decreased COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation of the human CYP11B2 promoter activity, indicating that endogenous Ubc9 and PIAS1 normally contributes to COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Fourth, ChIP assays clearly showed that COUP-TFI, Ubc9, and PIAS1 were recruited to a native COUP-TFI-regulated CYP11B2 promoter, demonstrating a functional coupling between COUP-TFI and Ubc9-PIAS1 in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Therefore, Ubc9 and PIAS1 possess all the characteristics expected for transcriptional coactivator proteins of COUP-TF in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	329	To confirm further that Ubc9 and PIAS1 are coactivators of COUP-TFI, we ruled out several other possible ways in which these proteins might enhance COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	330	 First, as SUMO-1 conjugation plays an important role in protein modification, the effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI transactivation might be the result of effects of Ubc9 and PIAS1 on COUP-TFI protein concentrations.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	331	 Our preliminary experiments showed that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 did not alter COUP-TFI protein concentration in H295R cells (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	332	 Second, it was also possible that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increases the concentrations of some coactivators or decreases the concentrations of some corepressors, which have been shown to interact with COUP-TFI, but the results showed that overexpression of these proteins did not alter the protein concentrations of SRC-1, GRIP-1, or SMRT in the cells (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	333	 Because these experiments were performed by transient transfection, we are not able to conclude unequivocally that Ubc9 and PIAS1 have no effects on these coregulator concentrations, and further investigation is required.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Third, another possibility is that overexpression of Ubc9 or PIAS1 increased the DNA-binding affinity of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	335	 To exclude the possibility, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to determine whether bacterially or in vitro transcription-translated Ubc9 or PIAS1 proteins affect the binding of COUP-TFI to its response element DNA (Ad5) of the human CYP11B2 promoter region.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	336	 The results showed that Ubc9 or PIAS1 have no effects on COUP-TFI binding to the Ad5 element (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	337	 Fourth, it has been proposed that SUMO-1 conjugation targets proteins to different cellular localizations.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	338	 SF-1 can be directed into nuclear speckles and sequestered from the nucleolus in the presence of SUMO-1, thus resulting in transcriptional repression (39).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	339	 It is therefore possible that coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 alters subcellular localization of COUP-TFI.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	340	 However, based on the subcellular localization data (Fig.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	341	 3), localization of COUP-TFI continues to be in the nucleus without re-localization.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Taken together with the above-mentioned findings, Ubc9 and PIAS1 clearly function as novel coactivators of COUP-TFI in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	343	 However, detailed molecular mechanisms are largely unknown and further investigation is required.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	344	Role of Ubc9 and PIAS1 in Sumoylation SUMO-1 conjugation (sumoylation) has been reported to play an important role in many cellular processes (25 to 30).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Sumoylation resembles ubiquitination, but the enzymes involved in these three processes are distinct.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	346	 SUMO-1 is conjugated to target proteins at the consensus sequence KXE ( is any hydrophobic amino acid, and X is any amino acid).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	347	 COUP-TFI has no such SUMO consensus sequence; however, several proteins, such as Mdm2 and CREB, are also modified at sites other than KXE (26).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Further investigation is required to elucidate whether COUP-TFI is sumoylated in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	349	Our data showed that both wild type and sumoylation-defective mutants Ubc9 (C93S) and PIAS1 (C351S) similarly enhanced COUP-TFI-regulated CYP11B2 promoter activities, indicating that these proteins possess dual distinct functions, SUMO-dependent and SUMO-independent pathways, such as coactivator function.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	350	 However, it is possible that ectopically produced Ubc9 and PIAS1 regulate COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation through not only sumoylation of COUP-TFI but also conjugation of SUMO-1 to one or more other cellular factors involved in transcriptional regulation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Recent data have raised the intriguing possibility that SUMO modification may have a specific impact on the ability of some transcription factors to function synergistically (27, 40, 41).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Previous studies of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) had identified a region referred to as a synergy control motif, mutation of which led to a selective increase in the activity of the GR from promoters bearing multiple, but not single sites.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	353	 The synergy control motif contains a consensus SUMO acceptor site, and recent data have shown that this is, in fact, the major site of addition of SUMO in the GR.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Considerable numbers of transcription factors, including GR (41 to 44), androgen receptor (32, 33, 45 to 51), progesterone receptor (47, 52), mineralocorticoid receptor (53, 54), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (55), and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (39, 56), are modulated by SUMO-1 attachment, and SUMO-modified transcription factors mostly resulted in attenuation of transcription.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	355	 Recent studies demonstrated that one of the molecular mechanisms of sumoylation-mediated repression is protein modified by SUMO-1 recruited histone deacetylases and transcriptional corepressors, thus repressing transcription (29, 38, 57 to 59).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	356	 However, there are also opposite examples of SUMO-modified proteins, which lead to transcriptional activation rather than repression.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Transcriptional coactivators, such as SRC-1 and GRIP1, are shown to be modified by SUMO-1, thus resulting in enhanced transcriptional coactivator capacities (60, 61).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Therefore, sumoylation does not necessarily induce transcriptional repression depending on the substrates.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	359	 The molecular mechanisms that could explain how SUMO modification affects transcriptional regulation are largely unknown.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	360	COUP-TFI-Ubc9-PIAS1 Complexes Are Crucial for Aldosterone Synthesis We have identified three important cis-elements in the hCYP11B2 promoter: a CRE at  to 71/ to 64, a cis-element termed Ad5 at  to 129/ to 114, and a third cis-element termed NBRE-1 ( to 766/ to 759) (8, 9, 12).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	361	 The CRE is common to both hCYP11B1 and hCYP11B2 and is regulated by both protein kinase A- and calmodulin-dependent kinase-dependent mechanisms.

0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	363	 The present results confirmed Ad5 element is crucial for CYP11B2 transactivation, because deletion of the element dramatically reduces basal and COUP-TFI-mediated transactivation (Fig.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	364	 Based on the present and previous reports (8, 9, 12), COUP-TFI and/or Nurr1/NGFI-B play important roles in transactivation of human CYP11B2 gene through binding to the Ad5 element.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	365	 The physiological importance of these particular transcription factors should be investigated in vivo.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	366	 Our preliminary data demonstrated that levels of expression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 are not altered in aldosterone-producing adenomas of patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those in normal adrenals.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	367	2 However, the significance of Ubc9 and PIAS1 in aldosterone-producing adenomas remains to be further investigated.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	368	We have recently shown that the effects of K+ and angiotensin II (Ang II) on hCYP11B2 transcription occur through two pathways; increased expression of Nurr1/NGFI-B and phosphorylation of ATF-1/CREB (13).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Ang II treatment rapidly induces levels of mRNA and protein of Nurr1/NGFI-B, thereby transactivating hCYP11B2 gene (8, 9).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	370	 Both Nurr1 and NGFI-B markedly increased transcription of hCYP11B2 through binding to the NBRE-1 and Ad5 sites, which are unique to hCYP11B2.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	371	 (62) have very recently reported that COUP-TF is a negative regulator of steroidogenesis in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	372	 They also showed that Ang II treatment dramatically decreased levels of COUP-TF in the cells, thus activating StAR gene expression.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Based on these findings, it is tempting to speculate that levels of expression of COUP-TFI, Ubc9, or PIAS1 are regulated by Ang II treatment.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	374	 We therefore investigated these possibilities in H295R cells; however, Ang II treatment did not affect expression levels of COUP-TFI, Ubc9, or PIAS1 in real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis (data not shown).
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	375	 The reason why Ang II treatment showed different effects on COUP-TFI levels between other report and ours is not known; however, different cellular context, such as bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa cells and human H295R cells, may be one reason for that.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	376	 We do not know a physiological role of COUP-TFI and Ubc9-PIAS1 in Ang II and K+ regulation of hCYP11B2 expression in this study, and this should be investigated.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	377	In conclusion, we identified novel COUP-TFI-interacting proteins, Ubc9 and PIAS1, and these proteins function as coactivators of COUP-TFI for human CYP11B2 transactivation.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	378	 The unique localization profiles of these proteins in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells are consistent with a crucial physiological role in aldosterone biosynthesis.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Therefore, the COUP-TFI-Ubc9-PIAS1 complexes shed new light in controlling the long term capacity of the adrenal gland to produce aldosterone.
0.33547345.15611122.html.plaintext.txt	380	 In addition, these studies provide new mechanisms through which COUP-TFI can act as a transcriptional activator through the novel interaction with Ubc9 and PIAS1.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received August 9, 2000; Revised and Accepted October 18, 2000.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Target site selection of transposable elements is usually not random but involves some specificity for a DNA sequence or a DNA binding host factor.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	4	 We have investigated the target site selection of the long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon Tf1 from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	5	 By monitoring induced transposition events we found that Tf1 integration sites were distributed throughout the genome.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mapping these insertions revealed that Tf1 did not integrate into open reading frames, but occurred preferentially in longer intergenic regions with integration biased towards a region 100 to 420 bp upstream of the translation start site.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Northern blot analysis showed that transcription of genes adjacent to Tf1 insertions was not significantly changed.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	8	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Transposable elements are discrete DNA segments that can translocate between non-homologous insertion sites.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Although they usually insert into many different sites, most elements display some degree of target selectivity.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This serves to facilitate element propagation and to avoid insertions into essential genes of the host.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A target site may be selected through direct interactions between the transposable element and the target DNA or through its association with accessory proteins that may be element- and/or host-encoded (reviewed in 1).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	12	Well-studied examples of transposable element targeting include Drosophila P elements and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons Ty1 to Ty5.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	13	 P elements have a preference for 5' untranslated regions and for regions 100 to 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This region-specific integration can result in changes in the expression level of adjacent genes and has been exploited for genetic screens (for review see 2,3).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In the case of Ty1 to Ty4,  > 90% of native insertions in the genome are found in upstream regions of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III), such as tRNA genes (4).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Ty1 integrates 70 to 700 bp upstream of the transcription start site of these genes and it has been demonstrated that this is due to interactions between the retrotransposon and a component of the RNA Pol III transcriptional apparatus and/or through its recognition of chromatin structures associated with RNA Pol III transcription (5 to 9).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, Ty1 integration also occurs within pre-existing LTRs (10), as well as upstream or within a variety of Pol II-transcribed genes which can result in alterations in the expression levels of these genes (11 to 13).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	18	 For Ty3, target specificity appears to depend on the ability of the Ty3 integration machinery to compete with Pol III for interactions with TFIIIB and TFIIIC transcription factors (14,15).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Ty3 inserts only at Pol III-transcribed genes and integrates in a site-specific manner within a few base pairs of the transcription start site.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Ty5 typically integrates near telomeres or the silent mating loci, HML and HMR (16,17), and it is thought that integration complexes recognise chromatin or other DNA-bound proteins (18).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	21	The LTR-retrotransposon Tf1 isolated from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (19) contains a single open reading frame (ORF) (20) encoding Gag, protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins (19,21).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Tf1 integrates into genomic DNA due to transposition events, and it has been shown that this transposition activity is independent of temperature (21).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Like Ty3, Tf1 is a member of the gypsy family of transposable elements (19), but it remains to be determined whether it also has a preference for Pol III promoters.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Here we report the analysis of the target site specificity of Tf1.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	25	 By examining the genomic distribution of induced transposition events we found that Tf1 is preferentially targeted to intergenic regions close to the 5' end of ORFs with no preference for pol III promoters.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The plasmid was transformed into ura4 to  cells, and transposition was induced by depleting thiamine from the medium in order to activate the nmt1 promoter.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Next, cells were plated on 5-FOA to select for uracil auxotrophs to ensure that the original plasmid was lost from the cells, and colonies were selected for G418 resistance ensuring that Tf1 was still present in the cells.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Usually, G418 resistance can only occur if a Tf1 transposition event from the plasmid to the chromosome has taken place.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	104	The majority of Tf1 insertions were at different locations in the genome To investigate the distribution of Tf1 insertions within the genome we analysed 40 putative transposition events by Southern blotting (Fig.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Of these, 34 (85%) showed unique restriction patterns indicating that insertions occurred at sites distributed throughout the genome.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	106	 The remaining six insertions (15%) consisted of three pairs with each pair having an identical restriction pattern which differed from the other two pairs.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The two insertions of each of these three pairs could have occurred on the same genomic fragment.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	108	 However, they could also have coincidentally occurred on different fragments of similar size as was the case with clones 31 and 33, which showed a similar restriction pattern but mapped to different locations on chromosome I (Table 1).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Probing the blots with a URA3-specific probe gave no signal showing that the pHL414 plasmid was not present in the clones, either as free plasmid or integrated in the genome (data not shown).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	110	 We also confirmed the integrity of the transposon by reprobing the blots for the neo gene (data not shown).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	111	 These results indicate that Tf1 insertion occurs at sites distributed throughout the genome.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	119	cerevisiae we predict that ~83% of these would be non-essential (27).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Thus, we would expect that 52% of the transposition clones would have an insertion in a non-essential ORF.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Given the lack of any such event, we can conclude that Tf1 integration was not random, but was significantly biased towards intergenic regions.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	122	To investigate whether the insertion of Tf1 within intergenic regions was random, we analysed the distribution of insertion sites with respect to the 5' or 3' region of the nearest gene.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In order to do so, we divided the targeted intergenic regions in half and allocated the insertions to the 5' or 3' region of the closest ORF.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	124	 On this basis, 10 of 15 insertions between tandem ORFs and all 12 Tf1 insertions between divergent ORFs mapped closer to the 5' than to the 3' end of an ORF.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Correspondingly, Figure 2A shows 22 Tf1 insertions in the 5' region and five insertions in the 3' region of an representative ORF.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	126	 The 5' region of Tf1-targeted genes had a mean size of 980 bp as determined by calculating the mean size of Tf1-targeted intergenic regions flanked by ORFs in divergent orientation (1.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Thus, if transposition into the 5' region of genes was completely random, 33% of the insertions would have been found in a region of 320 bp.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, our analysis revealed that 82% (18/22) of the insertions were in a band 100 to 420 nt upstream of the translation start site of an ORF.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This significant bias of Tf1 integration towards a 320 bp band close to the 5' end of ORFs is further supported by the lack of any insertion between convergent ORFs.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Taking into account the frequency and the average size of the different intergenic regions, we would have expected to find 10 to 11 Tf1 insertions in intergenic regions flanked by divergent ORFs (27%, 1.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	131	1 kb), 12 to 13 insertions in regions flanked by tandem ORFs (45%, 0.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	133	 We found 12 insertions between divergent ORFs and 15 insertions between tandem ORFs, but no insertion between convergent ORFs (Table 1).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This suggests that Tf1 avoids convergent intergenic regions entirely, presumably because of its preference for 5' ends of ORFs.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	144	  If Tf1 simply had a preference for 5' ends of ORFs we would have expected that the mean size of Tf1-targeted intergenic regions would have been equivalent to the mean size of the corresponding regions in the genome.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, we found that the mean size of Tf1-targeted intergenic regions flanked by divergent (1.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	146	5 kb, n = 15) ORFs was larger than the mean size of these regions in the genome (1.

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Thus, our analysis suggests that Tf1 integrated preferentially into particular large intergenic regions, and that this was not directly related to its preference for a region at the 5' ends of ORFs.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	150	We examined next whether Tf1 inserted at 5' ends of ORFs by targeting directly or indirectly a particular DNA sequence.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The retroelement did not show a preference for AT-rich regions as has been reported for Ty1 elements (28).

0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	166	For budding yeast Ty1 and Ty3 elements, a preference for 5' ends of tRNA genes has been reported previously (6,7).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, we did not observe this preference for Tf1.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Furthermore, our analysis revealed that Tf1 integration was not biased towards a particular chromosome or a region on a chromosome (Table 1), with the exception of two Tf1 insertion events which occurred within a distance of 3 kb of each other (clones 21 and 39).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In this region there was no evidence for a local recombination event or the presence of particular sequences, like LTRs or rRNA and tRNA genes.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	170	Tf1 integration had no significant effect on transcription of adjacent genes It has been reported that Ty1 inserts into 5' untranslated regions and can activate, inactivate or confer constitutive expression or mating-type regulation on neighbouring transcriptional units (13).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	171	 P elements can mutate genes in a similar way by preferentially inserting into the 5' untranslated region as well as into a region 100 to 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site (2).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	172	 To analyse the effects of Tf1 insertion on the transcription of adjacent genes, we examined eight transposition clones by northern blot analysis (Table 2).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	173	 As shown in Figure 3, the changes in the transcription level of the examined genes were  < 2-fold and the size of the transcripts remained unchanged when compared to a control.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These results suggest that, unlike Ty1 and P elements, Tf1 does not preferentially target 5'-UTRs and that the retrotransposon can insert close to ORFs without interfering with transcription.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Since very little is known about the size of promoter regions in S.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	176	pombe we speculate that these might be small in some genes and remain unaffected by an upstream Tf1 insertion.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Alternatively, Tf1 might have affected the function of some transcription regulation elements upon insertion, but the retroelement controls the expression of adjacent genes with its own LTR-located promoter and enhancer elements, as it has been described for Ty1 elements (29,30).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Northern blot analysis of genes adjacent to Tf1 insertions.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The transcription level and the size of the transcript of the two genes adjacent to a Tf1 insertion were analysed by northern blot.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The names of the gene transcripts detected from transposition (m) and control clones (wt) are shown to the right of the gels.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	181	 No transcript was detected for SPCC777.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	182	 As a loading control, rRNA was stained with methylene blue for the 3.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	183	8 kb band, or the his3 transcript level was monitored.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	184	  Tf1 did not disrupt the wee1 ORF in a screen for cdc25 revertants To investigate the frequency of Tf1 insertion into a particular gene we screened for transposon induced revertants of a temperature-sensitive cdc25-22 mutant because generally such revertants are due to inactivation of the wee1 ORF (31).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	185	 We induced transposition from the pHL414 plasmid in a cdc25 temperature-sensitive strain at the permissive temperature, followed by selection of cells able to grow at the restrictive temperature on 5-FOA and G418.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	186	 We screened  > 8 x 106 cells carrying a Tf1 insertion and would have expected to obtain approximately 1700 Tf1 integrations in the wee1 ORF if transposition were completely random.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, we obtained only two transposition clones which grew at 36 degrees C and their revertant phenotype was not due to a Tf1 insertion within or close to the wee1 gene as shown by Southern blotting (Fig.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This result is consistent with our previous findings that Tf1 targets 5' ends of ORFs without affecting the expression of the encoded protein.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In preliminary experiments we used a modified transposition protocol and screened for transposition clones auxotrophic for glutamate, adenine, histidine or lysine.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	190	 No auxotrophic mutants with a transposon insertion were found.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	191	Physiological stress did not alter Tf1 transposition In order to see if we could increase or randomise transposition, we induced transposition while subjecting S.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	192	pombe cells to various treatments which were reported to increase transposition of Ty1 elements (32 to 34).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	193	 We investigated transposition during (i) damaging DNA with 20  microg/ml bleomycin or 4.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	194	2 mM 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, (ii) osmotic stress with 100 mM ss-mercaptoethanol or 10% dimethyl sulphoxide, (iii) changing the chromatin structure by depolymerising microtubules with 100  microg/ml thiabendazole or 25  microg/ml methyl-ss-cyclodextrin, (iv) meiosis, (v) nitrogen starvation, and (vi) in block and release assays using hydroxyurea and temperature shifts.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	195	 However, none of these treatments resulted in significant changes in the quantity or quality of Tf1 transposition (data not shown) as monitored by determining the transposition efficiency (21) and by using the screen for cdc25 revertants, respectively.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	196	Tf1 might target 5' ends of ORFs by interacting with a host factor We have shown that Tf1 does not insert into ORFs and that Tf1 insertion occurred preferentially in large intergenic regions, with a bias towards a 320 bp region located 100 bp upstream of the translation start site.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Northern blot analysis of genes adjacent to Tf1 insertions did not reveal any significant changes in the transcription level or size of the corresponding transcript.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Consistent with these results, we propose that Tf1 is targeted region-specific close to the 5' ends of ORFs by a DNA binding host factor.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	199	 This could be a component associated with chromatin structure because it has been shown previously that Tf1 transposition is decreased in the presence of the histone deacytelase inhibitor Trichostatin A (35).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Furthermore, the retrotransposon encodes a chromo motif (chromatin organisation modifier) (36) which could mediate interactions with chromatin-associated factors (37).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Alternatively, or in addition, a transcription-related factor could target Tf1 to 5' ends of ORFs, as it has been described for Ty1 elements (5,7 to 9,38).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In the case of Tf1, however, this factor is more likely to be associated with the Pol II transcription complex because Tf1 insertion is not biased towards Pol III-transcribed genes.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	203	 However, we failed to detect any DNA binding factor sites although these may have been too degenerate or short to be detected.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	204	pombe genome is densely packed with ORFs, the size of intergenic regions is limited (see earlier), and so larger intergenic regions may contain a higher number of target sequences for factors involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and/or transcription.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Therefore, Tf1 might preferably insert into large intergenic regions because the host factor(s) targeting the retroelement is more likely to be present in these regions.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	206	The isolation of Tf1 insertions in our study was based on the expression of the neo gene.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Thus, it is possible that some other Tf1 targets were not detected because they are in silent regions of the genome, such as the centromere, the telomeres or the mating type loci (39 to 41).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Analysis of unselected transposition events will therefore be an important task for future studies.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	209	Application of Tf1 as tool for molecular biology Transposons have proven to be very helpful molecular tools.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	210	 They have been used as insertional mutagens to tag genes (42), and to generate transcriptional and translational fusions (43).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Our analysis has shown that Tf1 is not suitable for insertional mutagenesis; however, altering the target site specificity of Tf1 through random mutagenesis might turn it into a useful tool for this application (44).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In this respect it would also be important to know whether target site specificity of Tf1 is changed in mutant strains with an altered chromatin structure, as is the case for some Ty elements (30,45 to 47).
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Similarly, treating cells with Trichostatin A, which results in a reduced Tf1 transposition (35), could alter target site preference.
0.308273.11095681.html.plaintext.txt	214	 In addition to providing information about transposition and target site selectivity, the Tf1 system could provide a useful tool with which to probe and dissect chromatin structure in vivo as already suggested for retrotransposons (1,7,47).

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	3	Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is a transcription factor whose expression is crucial for mouse embryonic development, for liver-specific gene expression and for the prevention of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Its domain structure has been defined previously and is similar to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A repressor domain has now been localised to a region of 14 amino acids (residues 428-441) near the C-terminus of HNF4 and is sufficient by itself to repress the activity of the activation function 2 (AF2) domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Multiple mutations within this repressor domain enhance activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Interestingly, this repressor domain shares homology with a repressor domain in the progesterone receptor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In a detailed mutagenesis study of the AF2 core, we demonstrate that L 366, which is conserved in the AF2 core between HNF4 and a number of orphan nuclear receptors, is essential for the full activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, a double mutation of E 363 and L 366 suggests that these residues might act in a cooperative manner.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	10	Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) was first isolated as a protein involved in regulating a number of liver-specific genes (1).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	11	 It shares amino acid sequence homology with the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Since no ligand has yet been found for HNF4, it is classified as an orphan nuclear receptor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	13	Extensive work carried out on nuclear receptors (e.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	14	 oestrogen and retinoic acid receptors) has shown that they have a modular structure, with distinct regions carrying out specific functions (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The N-terminal region (A/B) contains an activation function 1 (AF1) whose activity can be cell-type as well as promoter-context specific (3).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A highly conserved zinc finger domain, required for DNA binding, is present in region C, with region D acting as a hinge (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The C-terminal half of these receptors contains a long hydrophobic domain (region E), which encodes various functions.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These include receptor dimerisation, ligand binding and a ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF2) (2).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The AF2 domain contains a core region of seven amino acids [Phi][Phi][KHgr]a[Phi][Phi]a/L (where `[Phi]' is a hydrophobic residue, `[KHgr]' any residue, `a' an acidic residue and L = leucine) which is critical for activation and is conserved in many nuclear receptors (4).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The extreme C-terminal region of these receptors (region F) varies in length between receptors and its function is unknown.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In HNF4, this region is extended and contains a proline-rich domain (1).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	22	HNF4 is expressed in many tissues including liver, kidney, pancreas and intestine (1,5,10).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	23	 There are a number of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (5).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For example, the HNF4[alpha] gene in humans encodes three isoforms, [alpha]1, [alpha] 2 and [alpha]4.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	25	 There is, in addition, a distinct [gamma] subtype encoded by the HNF4[gamma] gene (5).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The rat HNF4 isoforms 1-455 and 1-465 are equivalent to human [alpha]1 and [alpha]2 respectively (1,6).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In Xenopus laevis, HNF4 is encoded by two distinct ([alpha] and [beta]) genes (7).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	28	Deletion of HNF4 is embryonic lethal in mice, since it resulted in the induction of cell death in embryonic ectoderm and impairment of gastrulation of mouse embryos carrying a homozygous (-/-) knockout of the HNF4[alpha] gene (8).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In the regulation of the factor IX gene, point mutations which disrupt an HNF4 binding site result in haemophilia B (9,10).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Recently, heterozygotes carrying mutations in the HNF4[alpha] allele were linked to one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (11).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	31	 HNF4 is also involved in the regulation of a number of genes required for both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as erythropoiesis (1,12).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	32	 These genes include apolipoprotein CIII, pyruvate kinase, [alpha]1-antitrypsin and erythropoietin.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	33	Previous work aimed at investigating the C-terminal activation domain of HNF4 in transcription showed that large deletions in the C-terminal region abolished transactivation (12,13).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	34	 HNF4 was also shown to interact with the basal transcription factor TFIIB (13).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Recent evidence has suggested that E363 and L366 of the AF2 core are important for the activity of the AF2 domain (14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, this study was limited to single mutations at either position in the context of GAL4-HNF4 deletion fusion constructs (amino acids 128-370) which lacked other essential domains (the N-terminal AF1 domain, the DNA binding domain, and the repressor domain in the extended C-terminal region which is characterised in this report).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	37	In this report, we demonstrate by extensive mutagenesis in the context of both full-length HNF4 and full-length HNF4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain that Leu 366 of the AF2 core is essential for full AF2 activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	38	 By investigating the effect of a double mutation involving both E363 and L366, we show that these residues may act cooperatively.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In addition, we have precisely mapped the location of a repressor domain (initially described in ref.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	40	 14 and postulated to lie between residues 371 and 455) to amino acids 428-441 and have defined amino acid residues within this domain which are required for its activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	41	MATERIALS AND METHODS Reporter plasmids and GAL4-HNF4 fusion constructs.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	42	Reporter plasmids pCAT4 and pAPF1-HIV-CAT (1,15) were used to determine the transactivation activities of GAL4-HNF4 fusion constructs and native HNF4 constructs, respectively.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	43	 pCAT4 is a reporter plasmid with four GAL4 response elements, an inverted CCAAT box, and a TATA element controlling the CAT reporter gene in the pBluescript backbone; pAPF1-HIV-CAT contains two HNF4 response elements in a direct repeat, and the -57 to +80 of the HIV LTR controlling the CAT reporter gene.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	44	 To monitor transfection efficiency, the internal control plasmid pGLtkLUC (16) was used.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The plasmid pGAL4 1-147 (17) contains the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast GAL4 protein driven by the immediate-early human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The GAL4-HNF4 full-length fusion constructs, and all C-terminal deletion constructs of HNF4 were constructed by PCR amplification of the appropriate fragment of HNF4 derived from the plasmid, pCB6HNF4 (16), using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	47	 After purification of the PCR products, a BamHI/KpnI restriction digest was carried out, followed by an in-frame ligation with the GAL4-DBD using the BamHI/KpnI restriction sites in pGAL4 1-147.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	48	All GAL4-HNF4 full-length fusion proteins carrying a point mutation at E 363 or L 366, and the repressor domain mutants, were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Pritlove, unpublished data).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Native (as opposed to GAL4-HNF4 fusion constructs) full-length HNF4 constructs with point mutations at E 363 or L 366 were constructed by removing the GAL4-DBD (GAL4 1-147) from the appropriate GAL4-HNF4 fusion construct by a HindIII/BamHI restriction digest.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The fusion construct GAL4-HNF4 1-372+428-441 was made by first amplifying the pGAL4-HNF4 1-372 fragment, followed by a ligation step to insert a double-stranded oligonucleotide of the repressor domain of HNF4 (residues 428-441).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The sequence of all constructs were verified by fluorescent dideoxy sequencing.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	53	HeLa and HepG2 cells were cultured using 60 mm dishes in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Transient transfections were carried out using the standard calcium-phosphate precipitation method (10).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Briefly, a total of 15  microg of DNA was transfected, consisting of 10  microg of the reporter plasmid, 2  microg of the expression plasmid, 2  microg of the internal control plasmid and 1  microg of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fresh medium added.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	163	In this report we have studied the C-terminal activation region of HNF4, concentrating our attention on two short regions.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These are firstly, the well-known AF2 core, which is conserved in nuclear receptors (4) and secondly, a novel short repressor domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These regions were studied either by deletion analysis or by site-directed mutagenesis of HNF4 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	167	Previous studies of the C-terminal activation domain of HNF4 suggested that the AF2 core (residues 360-366) was important for activity (12-14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Furthermore, a mutation of L366->E, in an HNF4 deletion fusion construct (amino acids 128-370) suggested that residue 366 was important for the activity of the AF2 domain (14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	169	 However, this result is preliminary because it was studied on a HNF4 deletion construct which lacked three essential domains, the N-terminal AF1 domain, the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal repressor domain (see below).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	170	 It is arguable that the results might not be typical of intact HNF4.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Another potential criticism of a previous study (14) is that the conclusions as to the importance of particular amino acid residues of the AF2 core particular were based on studies of a single point mutant at each position, 363 and 366, which might not be representative had other mutants been studied.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Here we set out to study multiple mutations at position 366 of the AF2 core and to study a double mutant involving both positions 363 and 366 to gain further insight into the role of the AF2 core.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	173	The results of successive C-terminal deletions (Fig.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Therefore, four different point mutations (L->A, D, Q or I) were constructed to definitively assess the role of L 366 in both full-length HNF4 (Fig.

0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	178	 All mutations decreased the transactivation activity, indicating that Leu 366 is required for full activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	179	 However, in contrast to a previous report where the activity of a mutant at 366 was reduced to [sim]5% of wild-type, we detected activities varying from [sim]35 to 75% of wild-type.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This suggested, surprisingly, that transactivation activity is not absolutely dependent on Leu 366, even although it is conserved in a number of orphan receptors (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A, D, Q and I were clearly functional at least in our transient transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This result is not an artefact of the fusion of intact HNF4 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, since essentially similar quantitative results were obtained irrespective of whether full-length HNF4, or full-length HNF4 fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, were studied (compare Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, the fact that a conservative amino acid substitution 366 (L->I) showed the highest activity in our assay ([sim]60-70%), whereas non-conservative amino acid substitutions 366 (L->A, D, Q) showed lower activities (35-60%) still argues for the functional importance of Leu at 366 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	184	E363 is also highly conserved between HNF4 and all nuclear receptors with known ligands, although it is substituted by a D in some orphan receptors (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	185	 E363 was selected for mutation because it is known to be involved in the formation of a salt-bridge and is critical for transactivation in RAR[gamma] (18).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Mutation of E363->A in HNF4 here (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	187	 5) indicated that this residue, like residue 366, was required for full activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Our result at this position differed from a previous report (where activity was reduced to  < 5% of wild-type; 14) in that significant residual activity was observed (between 50 and 70% of wild-type; Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	189	 5C and D) depending on whether with the full-length HNF4 construct or the GAL4 full-length HNF4 fusion construct was used in the transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	190	 We attribute this difference to the fact that full-length HNF4 was used in our studies, whereas HNF4 deletion constructs were used in the previous report (14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	191	It is significant that a double mutant of 363 and 366 also retained [sim]50% activity in our assay (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The fact that the double mutant failed to demonstrate an additive effect over and above that of the two point mutants assayed separately is consistent with E363 and L366 cooperating to regulate the activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These experiments illustrates both the importance of E363 and L366 of the AF2 core, yet also demonstrate the core is partly redundant at least in our transactivation assay.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	194	 It remains possible that the redundancy observed in the mutations studied here results from a compensatory effect of the AF1 domain, which is known to transactivate (14) and is present in our full-length HNF4 constructs.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	195	Our initial C-terminal deletion experiments suggested the presence of a repressor activity within residues 380-455 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	196	 2B, and previously proposed to lie between residues 371 and 455; 14).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	197	 By aligning the amino acid sequence of the PR repressor domain (19) with the entire HNF4 sequence, a short region (residues 430-441) showing 40% identity to a previously characterised repressor domain in PR was localised in HNF4 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This presumptive repressor domain was first shown to confer repressor activity by itself (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Thus, when a short peptide from amino acid 428 to 441 containing the HNF4 repressor domain was fused in-frame downstream of a high activity C-terminal deletion fusion construct, transactivation was severely inhibited, decreasing from >300 to 22%.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	200	 This is unlikely to be the result of decreased protein expression of this particular fusion construct, since a gel shift analysis of a panel of deletion constructs all showed reasonably similar levels of protein expression (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	201	 3) This implied that the peptide containing amino acids 428-441 was sufficient, by itself, to act as a repressor.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Further evidence for this repressor domain came from a study of two constructs with multiple point mutations (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	203	It is interesting to note that in the experiment where the isolated repressor domain was fused to F 1-372 (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	204	 6B), the AF2 core was intact; hence an activity closer to the that of the full-length fusion (100%) might have been expected, whereas an activity of 22% was observed (Fig.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This suggests the repressor domain had a more potent inhibitory effect when fused closer to the AF2 core, than if it were in its normal location.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Perhaps the close proximity of the repressor domain to the AF2 core may restrict the accessibility of potential coactivator proteins to the AF2 core, either by binding a corepressor protein or simply by masking critical residues in the AF2 core.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In the case of the PR repressor domain, the repressor domain was shown to mediate its function through an unknown corepressor (19).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Experiments in an attempt to determine if the HNF4 repressor domain functioned through a corepressor were unfortunately inconclusive (data not shown).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	209	It is obviously interesting to know how the repressor domain in HNF4 functions and if it is required to regulate the activity of HNF4 in vivo.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	210	 An attractive, but speculative mechanism might involve the phosphorylation of threonine residues in the sequence ITTI (residues 434-437).
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	211	 A corepressor might bind to the repressor domain in the phosphorylated state and dissociate in the dephosphorylated state.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Thus mutations which disrupt these threonine residues would prevent phosphorylation, thus preventing repression and thereby enhancing the activity of HNF4.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	213	In summary, our characterisation of the AF2 domain in the C-terminal region of HNF4 has given new insights into the function of residues 363 and 366.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	214	 By extensive mutagenesis we have shown that L366 is essential for full AF2 activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	215	 An E363A/L366A double mutant suggested that E363 and L366 may act cooperatively to regulate the activity of the AF2 domain.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We have also shown that the activity of the AF2 domain is regulated by a repressor domain located within a proline-rich region.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	217	 We have localised this repressor domain to within amino acid residues 428-441 of HNF4, and showed it was necessary and sufficient for repressor activity in transient transfection studies in HeLa cells.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Furthermore, multiple point mutations within this repressor domain in the context of the full-length HNF4 fusion construct abolished repressor activity.
0.3009156.9547266.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The repressor domain shares homology with a recently reported C-terminal repressor domain in the progesterone receptor (19).

0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	3	 The GRU is comprised of two glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory factor-binding sites [AF1, AF2, AF3, and cAMP response element (CRE)] that bind distinct transcription factors.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) bind to the AF1 element and account for AF1 activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Members of the hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family bind to the AF2 element and provide AF2 activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this report, we show that the functions of AF1 and AF2 are dependent on their positions in the promoter, since they cannot substitute for each other nor can they be exchanged without a reduction in the response to glucocorticoids.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We also identified the domains of HNF4 and HNF3ss that are required for the AF1 and AF2 activities, respectively.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of HNF4 (amino acids 128 to 374) confers most of the AF1 activity, while the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3ss (amino acids 361 to 458) mediates AF2 activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These domains of HNF4 and HNF3ss appear to have distinct roles in the response to glucocorticoids, as there are unique structural requirements for each, as judged by the failure of most other classes of transactivation domains to serve as accessory factors.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results suggest that the regulation of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids requires specific interactions between GR, accessory factors, and coactivators, and that the transactivation domains of AF1 and AF2 are of fundamental importance in the assembly of this multiprotein complex.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene, which encodes a rate-controlling enzyme of hepatic gluconeogenesis, is under multihormonal control at the transcriptional level (1, 2).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Transcription of the PEPCK gene is stimulated by glucocorticoids, retinoic acids, and glucagon (via cAMP), while insulin and glucose repress PEPCK gene transcription (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A complex glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) in the PEPCK gene promoter is required for a complete glucocorticoid response.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The GRU consists of two adjacent glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory elements: AF1, AF2, AF3, and the cAMP response element (CRE) (see Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	15	 GR1 and GR2, alone or in combination, are unable to confer a glucocorticoid response when placed in the context of a heterologous promoter (9).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Although none of the four accessory elements mediates a glucocorticoid response itself, deletion or mutation of any accessory element in the PEPCK promoter causes about a 50 to 70% reduction in the glucocorticoid response (6, 8, 10).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Furthermore, any combination of two mutations of AF1, AF2, or AF3 essentially abolishes the glucocorticoid response (6).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Thus, the PEPCK GR1 and GR2, unlike simple glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) that can mediate a glucocorticoid response, are inactive in the absence of at least two accessory elements.

0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	21	The PEPCK GRU includes two GR-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory elements (AF1, AF2, AF3, and the CRE) and their associated trans-acting factors (lower panel).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The position of each cis-element, relative to the transcription initiation site, is indicated above the figure.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	23	  AF1 activity is provided by either of two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), or chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) (11).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	24	 COUP-TF also binds to the AF3 element and serves as an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response (6).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Members of the hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) families bind to the AF2 element (12, 13).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The binding of HNF3, but not C/EBP, to this element correlates with AF2 activity (14).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Hence, HNF3 has been identified as an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Finally, the CRE binding protein (CREB) and C/EBP family members bind to the CRE (12, 15, 16).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Although a physical interaction between GR and CREB has been identified in vitro (8), it appears that C/EBPss functions as the accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response through the CRE (16A ).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	30	In experiments reported in this paper, we show that AF1 cannot substitute for AF2, and vice versa, as the exchange of these elements in the PEPCK GRU results in about a 50% reduction of the glucocorticoid response.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, AF1 and AF2 both function in a position-dependent manner.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	32	 We also identify the domains within HNF4 (the AF1 factor) and HNF3ss (the AF2 factor) required for accessory factor activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In both cases, previously identified transactivation domains are critical for accessory factor activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Several distinct transactivation domains identified in other proteins cannot replace the HNF3 and HNF4 activities in the context of the PEPCK GRU.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These results indicate that glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription requires functional interactions between GR and the transactivation domains of at least two accessory factors, or between these two components and a third, coregulatory protein, and that these interactions require a specific spatial organization of the components of the GRU.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	36	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   AF1 and AF2 Function in a Position-Dependent Manner Constructs were made with various combinations of AF1 and AF2 substitutions in the context of the wild-type PEPCK promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (pAF1 to 2, also referred to as pPL32 in this and previous publications) to compare the roles of AF1 and AF2 in the PEPCK GRU (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	37	 When the AF2 element was replaced by an AF1 element (pAF1 to 1) or, conversely, when the AF2 element was put at the AF1 site (pAF2 to 2), glucocorticoid responses were 60 to 70% lower than those obtained from the wild-type pAF1 to 2 reporter (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	38	 These responses are equivalent to the glucocorticoid response obtained when either AF1 or AF2 is deleted or mutated (7, 10).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Thus, these results show that the AF1 element is inert at the position of the AF2 element, and the AF2 element is inactive at the AF1 site in the PEPCK GRU, and suggest that AF1 and AF2 have distinct functions.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These results are consistent with our previous observations (17).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Next, the AF1 element and the AF2 element were switched with each other (pAF2 to 1, Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	42	 2) to determine whether their relative positions within the GRU are critical.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	43	 If a specific spatial alignment between AF1, AF2, and the other members of the GRU is not important for a complete glucocorticoid response, and only the presence of these transcription factors is required, this construct should confer a glucocorticoid response similar to that of the wild-type pAF1 to 2 reporter.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, the pAF2 to 1 reporter construct conferred a much weaker glucocorticoid response than did pAF1 to 2.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Thus, the positional alignment of AF1 and AF2 in the PEPCK gene promoter appears to be critical for mediating optimal accessory factor activity.

0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We first focused our attention on HNF3.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	53	 A reporter construct was made wherein the AF2 element was replaced by a yeast GAL4-binding site (pGAL4AF2, Fig.

0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	73	 This result is perhaps not surprising since the GAL4 HNF3ss chimeric protein contains two separate DBDs.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A similar phenomenon, very low transcriptional activity, was observed when chimeric proteins that contain the GAL4 DBD and either full-length C/EBP, C/EBPss, and ATF-2 are tested (18, 19).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Strong transcriptional activity is observed only when the DBDs of C/EBP, C/EBPss, and ATF-2 are deleted (18, 19).

0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	207	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Much has been learned from the analysis of simple hormone response elements (HREs) placed, as single or multimerized copies, in the context of heterologous promoter reporter gene constructs.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	208	 It is not clear, however, whether such receptor-binding elements are sufficient for function in native promoters.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Multicomponent assemblies, including the HRE and cis-elements with associated DNA-binding proteins (so-called accessory factors), in an arrangement referred to as a hormone response unit (HRU), appears to be much more common (22).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Additional complexity is provided by a number of coregulators, which can bind to the hormone receptor and/or the accessory factors to modulate the rate of transcription of a given gene.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	211	 A specific HRU thus consists of a number of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions involving the hormone receptor, accessory factors ( > 30 have been identified) and coregulators.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	212	The PEPCK gene GRU is an example of the HRU described above.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	213	 A complete response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids requires the presence of four accessory factor elements and associated proteins (AF1, AF2, AF3, CRE) and two GREs (GR1 and GR2) with associated ligand-receptor complexes (see Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	214	 The loss of function of any one of these accessory element factor complexes results as a 50% reduction of the glucocorticoid response (6, 8, 10).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Loss of function of any combination of two results in a complete loss of the glucocorticoid response.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Similarly, a partial response is obtained if either of the GREs is deleted, but GR1 is quantitatively more important than GR2 (9).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	217	 It is evident that considerable redundancy has been built into this system.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Having defined the components of the GRU, we can now begin to address several key questions.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	219	 For example, are there unique structural requirements with respect to the orientation, positioning, and spacing of the accessory factors with respect to each other and the GREs? What domains are responsible for the accessory factor action of these proteins? Are coregulatory proteins involved? And finally, how does all of this come together to control the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene? The work in this paper addresses the first two of these questions.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	220	In the studies described above, it is apparent that AF1 cannot substitute for AF2, and vice versa.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Also, the two elements do not work well when inverted with respect to the rest of the GRU (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Therefore, it appears that a specific spatial organization of AF1 and AF2 within the PEPCK gene GRU is critical for the complete glucocorticoid response.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These results also suggest that AF1 and AF2 have distinct functions.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	224	 If so, specific domains that either activate transcription directly, or through a coregulatory intermediate, should be present in the accessory factors that bind to these elements, namely HNF4 and HNF3.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	225	AF1 activity is conferred by the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of HNF4 (a.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	226	 It is not known whether this domain functions directly or indirectly.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The fact that this accessory function can be assumed by the activation domains of E1A or VP16, which have no obvious similarity to the HNF4 domain (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	228	 9A), suggests that a protein-protein interaction is involved.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	229	 HNF4 binds to TFIIB and facilitates formation of the preinitiation complex (23); however, an HNF4 mutant that lacks the C-terminal activation domain still binds to TFIIB (23), so the effect may be mediated through the N-terminal transactivation domain, a region not necessary for accessory factor action in our studies (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Several coactivators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) (24), CBP/p300 (25, 26, 27), glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1)/TIF2 (28, 29, 30), and RAC3/ACTR (31, 32, 33), associate with the C-terminal activation domain of various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	231	 These proteins, including HNF4, have very similar C-terminal transactivation domains (21).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Indeed, we and others have recently shown that SRC-1, GRIP1, and CBP/p300 function as coactivators for HNF4 (34, 35).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The CR3 region of E1A exhibits AF1 activity, so this domain and the C-terminal region of HNF4 may interact with a common coactivator.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The CR3 domain associates with a wide variety of transcription factors and components of the basal transcription machinery, including the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), certain TBP-associated factors (TAF) such as human TAF 135 (36), Drosophila TAF 110, and TAF 250 (37), and several other DNA binding proteins, including ATF2, USF, and SP1 (38).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	235	 However, the interaction between the CR3 region of E1A and SRC-1, GRIP1, and CBP/p300 has not been reported.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Therefore, it is also possible that distinct coactivators provide AF1 activity in the context of the PEPCK GRU; thus, HNF4 and E1A may each interact with different coactivators.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	237	 COUP-TF also serves as accessory factor 1 for the PEPCK glucocorticoid response through both the AF1 and AF3 elements (6, 11).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	238	 COUP-TF functions as both a positive and negative regulator of gene transcription (39), and it is not known whether COUP-TF uses the same mechanism as HNF4 to provide AF1 activity.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	239	 We are currently identifying the domain(s) that provide AF1 activity in COUP-TF, and this analysis should clarify the issue of whether unique or common coactivators are involved.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	240	AF2 activity is provided by the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3ss, which contains two regions that are conserved in the various members of the HNF3 family of transcription factors (20).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	241	 445 to 458) contributes most of the AF2 activity, although region II (a.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	242	 369 to 387) is required for complete AF2 activity (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	243	 These regions do not have amino acid sequence motifs common to known transactivation domains (20).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, region III is a potent transactivator when fused to the GAL 4 DBD (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	245	 No coactivator has been identified to date that specifically interacts with the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3ss.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The CR3 domain of E1A provides substantial AF2 activity (Fig.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	247	 11), but VP16, in contrast to the case with AF1, is inactive.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Future experiments should clarify whether this distinction is important.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Furthermore, we have recently found that HNF3ss and GR interact in vitro (17).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	250	 However, the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3ss does not interact with GR in glutathione-S-transferase pull-down experiments (J.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Granner, unpublished observation).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	252	 More studies will be required to determine whether the previously noted interaction between HNF3ss and GR is physiologically important.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	253	The identification of the domains of HNF4 and HNF3ss necessary for accessory factor activity brings us a step closer to understanding how the GRU works.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	254	 In a previous paper we suggested that AF1 might stabilize the binding of GR to GR1, and that AF2 could be required for achieving the maximal transactivation potential of the GRU (9).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	255	 This hypothesis is based on the observation that the AF1 element is no longer required for the PEPCK gene glucocorticoid response when GR1, a low-affinity GR-binding site, is replaced by a strong GR-binding site (9).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	256	 In contrast, the AF2 element is still required for a complete glucocorticoid response in this situation.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	257	 The observation that AF1 and AF2 cannot substitute for one another, and that these elements must be oriented in a certain way with respect to each other and with the GR-binding sites, coupled with the identification of the transactivation domains of HNF4 and HNF3ss, should allow us to test the hypothesis that the assembly of a stereospecific nucleoprotein complex results in the stabilization of GR binding to the promoter and allows for efficient activation of the basal transcription machinery.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	258	 GR may act as a signal transducer that triggers the assembly of this nucleoprotein complex rather than as a transactivator, since neither GR1 nor GR2 can mediate a glucocorticoid response by themselves.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Alternatively, the transactivation domain of GR may contribute to the overall transcriptional capacity of the PEPCK GRU, but only in the presence of the interaction and/or transactivation domains of the accessory factors.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	260	The PEPCK gene GRU is conceptually similar to the interferon ss (IFNss) enhanceosome.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Viral induction of the IFNss gene requires the functional interaction of several regulatory elements, designated PRD I, II, III, and IV.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	262	 PRD II, III, and IV bind the transcription factors NFB, IRF1, and an ATF/c-Jun heterodimer, respectively.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Substitution of PRD IV with PRD II markedly reduces the viral induction (40) just as substitution of the AF1 and AF2 elements reduces the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Interestingly, when the transactivation domains of either NFB or IRF1 are replaced by the transactivation domain of VP16, viral induction of IFNss enhanceosome is markedly decreased even though these constructs provide much stronger basal transcription activity (41).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Furthermore, replacement of the transactivation domain of p65 by IRF1 reduces viral induction of IFNss enhanceosome activity (41), a result also similar to those described in this paper.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The assembly of a high-order nucleoprotein complex is required for the highly specific activation of IFNss enhanceosome, and CBP/p300 serves as an integrator in this complex (41, 42, 43).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	267	 It is conceivable that the activation of PEPCK gene transcription by glucocorticoids may use a similar mechanism.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The next challenge will be the identification of coactivators that interact with the functional domains of HNF3ss and HNF4 and mediate AF1 and AF2 activities.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	269	The multicomponent GRU may have evolved to provide both tissue-specific expression and versatile hormonal regulation of hepatic PEPCK gene transcription in response to a wide variety of environmental cues.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	270	 For example, PEPCK gene transcription is positively regulated by glucocorticoids in liver and negatively regulated in adipose tissue (1, 44).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF3 and HNF4, serve as AF2 and AF1, respectively, but these factors are not present in adipose tissue.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Thus, tissue-specific accessory factors may allow for differential regulation of PEPCK gene transcription by the same effector in different tissues.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	273	A simple GRE represents either an "all or none" or "on and off" switch, whereas the GRU allows for a graded response, and the multiple GR-binding sites and accessory factors provide inherent intraunit redundancy.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Interestingly, the PEPCK GRU is part of a much more complex assembly of elements and factors, which we have termed a metabolic control domain (MCD) (45).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	275	 The MCD consists of the response units for several hormones and metabolites, and it provides an integrated response to the demands of the organism for tightly regulated gluconeogenesis.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	276	 In addition to their role in the glucocorticoid response, the AF1 and AF3 elements also function as retinoic acid response elements (RARE 1 and 2) by binding a heterodimeric complex that consists of the retinoic acid receptor and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RAR/RXR) (5, 46, 47).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	277	 RARE1 and RARE2 collectively constitute an RARU and mediate the retinoic acid response that is necessary for gluconeogenesis (48).
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	278	 The CRE is an accessory element in the glucocorticoid response, and is part of a cAMP response unit that mediates the stimulatory effect of glucagon (15, 49, 50), which is the primary hormonal stimulator of gluconeogenesis.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Finally, the AF2 element, as part of a multicomponent IRU, also mediates the repressive effect of insulin by binding an, as yet unidentified, protein (51) and thus participates in the down-regulation of gluconeogenesis.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Thus, the different sets of proteins that bind to the PEPCK MCD, of which the GRU is an integral part, determine the direction and magnitude of PEPCK gene transcription and provide for additivity, synergism, intra- and inter-unit redundancy, and the dominance of one effect over another.
0.37755975.10194766.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This complex system has presumably evolved to provide the array of responses necessary to maintain a rate of gluconeogenesis compatible with the adaptive needs of the organism.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received September 4, 1998; Revised and Accepted October 27, 1998.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	4	The tissue-specific transcription factor HNF1[alpha] is expressed in kidney, liver, intestine and stomach of Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We show that the HNF1[alpha] gene is transcriptionally activated at the onset of zygotic gene transcription and that this transcription is maintained throughout development.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Ectodermal explants of blastulae (animal caps) express HNF1[alpha] mRNA upon stimulation with the mesoderm inducers activin A and BMP4 as well as on overexpression of Smad2 and Smad1, the corresponding members of the intracellular TGF-[beta] signal transducers, respectively.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Beside these factors that mediate their response through serine/threonine kinase receptors, bFGF, which acts via tyrosine kinase receptors, leads to HNF1[alpha] expression, too.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These embryonic inducers result in a delayed appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA, excluding a direct activation of HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In contrast, the maternally expressed nuclear receptors HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] activate the initial HNF1[alpha] transcription, since overexpression of HNF4 leads to a rapid expression of HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal caps.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Similarly, in entire neurulae HNF4 overexpression results in increased HNF1[alpha] transcription.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Therefore, we assume that the initial activation is dependent on maternal HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] transcription factors whereas HNF1[alpha] induction by growth factors reflects the property of these factors to induce the differentiation of mesodermal and entodermal cell types expressing HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	12	The differentiation of tissue-specific cell types during development of a multicellular organism is initiated in the fertilized egg by maternal components laid down during oogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Some of the most important maternal determinants regulating these early events include cell surface signalling molecules and their receptors as well as transcription factors.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The interplay of growth factors and transcription factors, which is best analyzed in Drosophila (1), is assumed to define the spatial activation of specific genes in development.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	15	In Xenopus, it is well established that maternal inductive signals emanating from the vegetal region of the cleaving embryo lead to a distinct pattern of gene expression in the equatorial region and thereby determine the prospective mesodermal tissues of the embryo (2).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These inductive factors are fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and members of the transforming growth factor [beta] (TGF-[beta]) family, with bFGF and activin A or Vg1 as the most significant members (2-6).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Whereas the FGF signal is received by membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptors, TGF-[beta]s act exclusively through serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface (7).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Intracellular TGF-[beta] signalling involves a class of proteins referred to as Smad proteins (7-10).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In Xenopus embryos, Smad1 and Smad2 overexpression in the animal cap mimics the effect of the TGF-[beta] family members BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein) and activin A, respectively (11,12).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In general, the Smad proteins seem to be phosphorylated at C-terminal serine residues by the activated type I receptor (13,14), form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 (15) and migrate into the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of TGF-[beta]-responsive genes by direct interaction with specific transcription factors (16).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Based on all these data Smad proteins are considered as essential intracellular components in TGF-[beta] signalling.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	22	In an approach to link maternal components with the transcriptional activation of a tissue-specific transcription factor we have investigated the expression of HNF1[alpha] in Xenopus (17-19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This tissue-specific transcription factor found in all vertebrates is expressed in endodermal tissues such as liver, gut and stomach but also in the kidney, a mesodermal derivative (17,20).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	24	 As binding sites for HNF1[alpha] are present in several genes specifically expressed in these tissues, it is assumed that HNF1[alpha] participates in the establishment of the differentiated state.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Previously, we showed by RNase protection analysis that the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts appear at the gastrula stage and therefore HNF1[alpha] gene transcription is zygotically activated (17).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	26	 To reveal the regulatory elements involved in HNF1[alpha] gene activation we injected promoter constructs into fertilized eggs.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We identified a minimal promoter fragment of the Xenopus gene sufficient for proper activation of the reporter gene in swimming larvae (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The promoter elements mediating gene activation appear to be conserved in vertebrate evolution as the injected rat HNF1[alpha] promoter is also regulated in Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	29	 By mutational analysis of the minimal regulatory unit of the Xenopus HNF1[alpha] promoter, an OZ element, two HNF1 binding sites and one binding site for HNF4 were characterized as regulatory elements (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The HNF4 binding site seems to play a predominant role, as it is not only sufficient but also essential for activation of the reporter gene (18).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	31	 HNF4 is encoded in a small gene family, with HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] identified in Xenopus (21,22).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Both HNF4 proteins are expressed maternally and are present in a gradient from the animal to the vegetal pole (22).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Overexpression of rat HNF4[alpha] in Xenopus leads to the ectopic appearance of HNF1[alpha] protein in the head and tail of swimming larvae (18).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	34	 These data support the assumption that HNF4 resides on the top of a transcriptional cascade leading to activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene during embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since ectopic HNF1[alpha] expression was analyzed only in swimming larvae, when organogenesis is already established, it is not known whether HNF4 is able to activate initial HNF1[alpha] transcription in embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	36	We have recently shown that activin A induces HNF1[alpha] protein expression in animal caps that differentiate into mesodermal and endodermal cell types (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	37	 By injecting various HNF1[alpha] promoter constructs, we could define the HNF4 binding site as an apparent activin A-responsive element in the HNF1[alpha] promoter (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, since HNF1[alpha] induction in animal caps was measured at the protein level after 3 days of culture (23), it is an open question whether activin A or its related factor Vg1, both reported to be maternal components (24-26), trigger the initial HNF1[alpha] gene activation in the developing embryo.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	39	In this report we investigate the effects of embryonic mesoderm inducers known to be present as maternal components in the egg on expression of the HNF1[alpha] gene and compare their inducing potential with the transcription factors of the HNF4 family.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	70	To identify the factors involved in embryonic activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene in the developing Xenopus embryo it was a prerequisite to determine the temporal expression pattern of HNF1[alpha] mRNA by a more sensitive technique than previously used (17).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	71	 1) we revealed that HNF1[alpha] transcripts are absent in the early cleaving embryo between the fertilized egg (stage 1) and the mid blastula (stage 8) stages, whereas the first transcripts are detectable at the late blastula (stage 9) stage corresponding to the initiation of zygotic gene transcription in Xenopus (31).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The amount of transcript remains constant up to the late gastrula (stage 12) stage and increases by ~100-fold during further development up to the swimming larva (stage 42) stage.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The amount of ODC mRNA, known to remain constant in Xenopus development (32), was similar in all RNA samples.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	75	 At the indicated developmental stages as defined (46) total RNA from five embryos was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of HNF1[alpha] and ODC transcripts.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	79	Therefore, HNF1[alpha] is zygotically expressed in Xenopus and transcription of this gene is maintained during all developmental stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Obviously, initial HNF1[alpha] transcription at the onset of zygotic gene transcription is initiated by regulatory components of maternal origin.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	81	The activin A signalling pathway leads to HNF1[alpha] induction.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	82	To analyze whether the maternal inducer activin A might initiate HNF1[alpha] expression we investigated at what time point activin A treatment leads to HNF1[alpha] gene transcription in explants of the animal pole of the balstula (animal caps).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Using RT-PCR we detected HNF1[alpha] mRNA in animal pole explants at 72 h after treatment with activin A (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This late appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA is very similar to the induction we have seen previously when analyzing the effect at the protein level (23).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	85	 As treatment of animal pole explants with activin A in conjunction with retinoic acid enhances activin A-dependent HNF1[alpha] protein induction (23), we determined the time point of HNF1[alpha] gene activation by activin A in the presence of retinoic acid.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	86	 As indicated in Figure 2 the first HNF1[alpha] transcripts are detectable after 24 h of incubation (lane 4).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Since under these conditions both goosecoid and brachyury transcripts are visible already after 3 h of treatment (lane 2), HNF1[alpha] expression cannot be an immediate response to activin A signalling.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	88	 As Smad2 is known to be an intracellular mediator of activin A signalling (7,33), we analyzed whether the introduction of this downstream effector might also activate HNF1[alpha] gene transcription.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Using an mRNA encoding a Flag tagged Smad2 protein we could verify in a western blot using a Flag tag-specific monoclonal antibody that Smad2 protein was present in the injected embryos at the time of animal cap explantation (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	90	 To analyze expression of HNF1[alpha] mRNA in these Smad2-injected animal caps, total RNA from the explants was isolated at different time points of culturing.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Based on RT-PCR analysis HNF1[alpha] transcripts were absent in animal caps derived from Smad2 mRNA-injected embryos after 0, 3 and 6 h of incubation (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The first few HNF1[alpha] transcripts appeared after 24 h (lane 6).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Their amount rose to a maximum (lane 7, 48 h) and remained at this level after 72 h of culture (lane 8).

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Control animal caps were cultured in buffer for 24 h.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	98	 As a control RT-PCR was also done on RNA isolated from whole embryos or on an aliquot lacking RNA (H2O).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The low level of HNF1[alpha] transcript present in the 24 h control (lane 1) is most likely due to the presence of endodermal cells contaminating this sample as the mesodermal markers goosecoid and brachyury are weakly induced.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	102	 For comparison animal caps derived from uninjected embryos were either cultured in buffer alone (lane 1) or in the presence of 10 ng/ml activin A (lane 2).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The leftover dissected blastulae of each group were used for protein extract preparation and analyzed by western blot analysis for expression of the Flag tagged Smad2 protein.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	104	 At the indicated time points the expression of HNF1[alpha], brachyury (Xbra), goosecoid (gsc), globin, muscle actin and ODC were measured by RT-PCR.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	105	In contrast, brachyury and goosecoid, both known to be activated as an early response to activin A/Smad2 signalling (34), were expressed at the time point of dissection (lane 3), indicating a successful initial mesodermal induction caused by the translated Flag tagged Smad2 mRNA.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	106	 As expected, the expression of both marker genes declined with longer culture periods and was replaced after 24 h by expression of muscle actin (lane 6), indicating late dorsal mesoderm, and after 48 h by the late ventral mesodermal marker globin (lane 7), as reported by Graff et al.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	107	 These data show that the activated activin A/Smad2 pathway leads to a late induction of HNF1[alpha] gene expression.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	108	The BMP4/Smad1 pathway leads to HNF1[alpha] mRNA expression.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	109	Signalling by BMPs that are also members of the TGF-[beta] family is another important maternal pathway in the early Xenopus embryo leading to activation of genes involved in mesoderm induction (reviewed in 35,36).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	110	 To investigate its potential role in HNF1[alpha] induction, we injected Xenopus eggs with RNA encoding BMP4 that leads to the translation of functional BMP4 protein in the early cleavage stages (37).

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	122	 To explore whether this pathway is able to activate HNF1[alpha] gene expression, we incubated animal caps in increasing concentrations of bFGF and analyzed the level of HNF1[alpha] mRNA.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	123	 After 72 h of incubation abundant HNF1[alpha] transcripts were found in caps treated with between 3 and 150 ng/ml bFGF (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Using the highest concentration of bFGF we determined the kinetics of HNF1[alpha] mRNA appearance in explanted animal caps.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	126	 A similar late appearance was also observed for globin transcripts, whereas brachyury transcripts (Xbra) were already seen 3 h after bFGF addition (lane 2), as previously described (41).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This delayed induction of HNF1[alpha] excludes the possibility that bFGF signalling leads to direct activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	145	Our data clearly establish that the tissue-specific transcription factor HNF4 activates HNF1[alpha] gene transcription without delay in animal caps and that this event is independent of mesoderm induction, since none of the mesodermal markers analyzed was affected.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As shown in Figure 7A, there is a much higher level of HNF1[alpha] transcripts in HNF4[beta]-injected embryos (lanes 3 and 4) than in uninjected (lane 1) or GFP2 mRNA-injected control larvae (lane 2).

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Protein extracts and total RNA from uninjected (lane 1) and mRNA-injected (lanes 2 and 3) embryos were prepared.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Expression of the Flag-Smad2 protein was analyzed in a western blot.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In (A) and (B) the abundance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA was measured by RT-PCR under less sensitive conditions than shown in Figure 1 to avoid overexposure of the strong HNF1[alpha] signals in lanes 3 and 4 of (A).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	159	To investigate whether Smad2 overexpression is able to activate early HNF1[alpha] transcription in the whole embryo as shown for HNF4 overexpression, we injected Flag tagged Smad2 mRNA into fertilized eggs and prepared extracts at the neurula stage from injected and uninjected stage 14 embryos.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	160	 By western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against the Flag epitope we can detect overexpressed Flag tagged Smad2 protein in two independent batches of mRNA-injected embryos (Fig.

0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This establishes that Smad2, unlike HNF4, is not able to increase early HNF1[alpha] gene transcription in the entire embryo and this finding correlates with the late induction found in animal caps (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	163	DISCUSSION HNF1[alpha] expression during embryogenesis.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	164	Our data show that HNF1[alpha] transcripts appear at stage 9 of Xenopus development, immediately after the onset of zygotic gene transcription at the MBT (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This finding extends our previous RNase protection analysis showing transcripts of the HNF1[alpha] gene only at stage 11 (17) and reflects the higher sensitivity of the RT-PCR method.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Even using this most sensitive detection system we failed to detect any maternal HNF1[alpha] mRNA.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This establishes that HNF1[alpha] expression depends entirely on zygotic transcription and thus on activation by maternal components.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	168	Transcription of HNF1[alpha] is initiated prior to organogenesis but as the low amounts of transcripts do not yield significant protein levels (17), we doubt that HNF1[alpha] has a regulatory role in these early stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	169	 This is reminiscent of the early expression pattern of Xenopus MyoD, where the initial weak and unrestricted expression in the mid blastula stage is without significance for muscle differentiation (42).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	170	HNF1[alpha] is a late response gene to the mesoderm inducers.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	171	The present data show that HNF1[alpha] induction by activin A, BMP4 or bFGF is a late response and thus differs from the early responses seen for the goosecoid and brachyury genes under the same conditions.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The much delayed response of HNF1[alpha] expression upon addition of the mesoderm inducers implies that the appearance of HNF1[alpha] mRNA reflects the differentiation of mesodermal and endodermal cells that express HNF1[alpha].
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This interpretation is also valid for preloading of the animal caps with Smad2 or Smad1, essential intermediate components of TGF-[beta] signalling, that fails to produce an early response of the HNF1[alpha] gene, too (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	174	Since we have shown previously that in animal caps the activin A signal is received by the HNF4 binding site of injected HNF1[alpha] promoter constructs (23), we assume that HNF4 is the major factor acting in the mesodermal and endodermal cells differentiated upon activin A treatment.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Further evidence that activin A signalling and HNF4-induced activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene are separate events in the early embryo is provided by our observation that in gel retardation experiments using protein extracts from Xenopus gastrulae with combined overexpression of Smad2 and HNF4 proteins, no Smad2/HNF4 interaction could be identified (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In contrast, such complexes have been found between the transcription factor FAST1 and the TGF-[beta] signalling molecule Smad2 that were bound to the activin response element of the Mix.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Consistent with this direct interaction on the induced promoter it has also been established that activin A stimulation of the Mix.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	178	2 promoter is an early response (43).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	179	HNF4 initiates HNF1[alpha] gene transcription.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	180	The main focus of our work was to analyze the mechanisms involved in the initial embryonic activation of the HNF1[alpha] gene.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	181	 We revealed that HNF4 is able to initiate HNF1[alpha] expression at the onset of zygotic gene transcription in blastula embryos whereas the mesoderm inducers activin A, BMP4 and bFGF fail to activate HNF1[alpha] gene expression in these early embryonic stages.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	182	Clearly, the HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] transcription factors are good candidates for initial activators, since they are present as maternal components (18,22) and the HNF1[alpha] promoter contains a functional HNF4 binding site (18,19).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	183	 This potential link can be verified by overexpression of rat HNF4[alpha] or endogenously expressed Xenopus HNF4[beta]: in both cases we found an increase in HNF1[alpha] gene transcription at the early neurula stage (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This induction is very rapid, as animal caps injected with HNF4[alpha] mRNA contained induced HNF1[alpha] mRNA already at the blastula stage, when they were explanted (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This implies that HNF4 translated on the injected mRNA during early cleavage stages prior to the MBT had accumulated and activated HNF1[alpha] transcription rapidly at the MBT.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	186	 From this observation we conclude that the cells of the animal caps are competent for efficient HNF1[alpha] gene transcription if triggered with the appropriate signal.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The induction of HNF1[alpha] by HNF4 is a specific effect and independent of mesoderm induction, as other mesoderm markers are not expressed in HNF4-injected animal caps (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	188	All these findings support the idea that maternal HNF4 is the initial activator of the HNF1[alpha] gene in Xenopus.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	189	 A loss-of-function study to test this assumption is difficult to perform, since HNF4 protein is already present in the egg and thus RNA depletion experiments are not possible.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Therefore, we introduced a fusion protein containing the HNF4 DNA binding domain and the putative ligand binding domain linked to the repressor domain of even-skipped of Drosophila into fertilized eggs.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Although this HNF4 repressor acted efficiently in hepatoma cells and was expressed at high levels in the injected embryos, we could not detect a significant reduction in endogenous HNF1[alpha] mRNA accumulation (data not shown).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	192	 We assume that the level of HNF4 repressor translated prior to the MBT is not sufficient to compete with the amount of maternal HNF4[alpha] and [beta] proteins (18,22) that had accumulated during several months of oocyte maturation.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In contrast, in all experiments where dominant negative variants of transcription factors have been successfully used to repress endogenous factors, e.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	194	 brachyury or eomesodermin (44,45), the inhibition involved zygotically accumulated trans-cription factors.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In these cases inhibition is probably facilitated as the embryo is preloaded with the repressors prior to expression of the zygotic factor to be inhibited.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	196	Overexpression of either rat or Xenopus HNF4 leads to increased transcription of the HNF1[alpha] gene in the early stages of embryogenesis (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This is in contrast to experiments done with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD: in this case only murine MyoD activated ectopic expression of myogenic markers in Xenopus embryos, whereas overexpressed Xenopus MyoD was hardly active (27).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Thus, in contrast to MyoD, the activity of HNF4 is species independent, indicating the high degree of functional conservation of the HNF4 family members in vertebrates (18,21,22).
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	199	Our data show no differences in the activating potential between distinct HNF4 isoforms in the early stages of development, as the injected [beta] isoform increases HNF1[alpha] transcription (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	200	 7) as efficiently as the [alpha] isoform of HNF4 (Fig.
0.22450218.9837989.html.plaintext.txt	201	 This finding possibly reflects the identical expression patterns of HNF4[alpha] and HNF4[beta] we have seen in whole-mount immunostaining in early cleavage stages (22).
