0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	181	The first aim current study investigate extent secretase activity subcellular compartments depends indeed PS1
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	182	To end expressed APP ct APP LDL two previously characterized trafficking mutants APP Peraus et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	183	APP ct lacks endocytosis signals cytoplasmic domain APP therefore slowly internalized
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	184	Compared APP WT APP ct processed mainly secretase activity cell surface Sisodia 1992 Tienari et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	185	This results replacement Ass production roughly equal production p3 product consecutive secretase activity Figs
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	186	2 3 confirming APP ct construct indeed behaves predicted
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	187	Therefore p3 production substrate reflects mainly secretase cleavage APPCTF cell surface
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	188	Expression construct PS1 deficient neurons resulted strong decrease p3 demonstrating secretase cleavage cell surface depends PS1 Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	189	Since APPs secretion affected absence PS1 Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	190	3 rule possibility decreased p3 production caused decreased secretase activity PS1 deficient cells
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	191	APP LDL expression selectively increased Ass40 secretion predicted preferential localization endosomes Koo Squazzo 1994 Peraus et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	192	Again absence PS1 Ass generation APP LDL strongly decreased demonstrating secretase processing APP endosomes depends PS1
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	193	It noted able detect endogenous PS1 immunoreactivity cell surface endosomes neuronal cells used current study Annaert et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	194	We next investigated whether could increase secretase processing APP ER intermediate compartment contain bulk PS1 immunoreactivity neurons
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	195	Although several authors provided evidence ER production site peptide particular Ass42 Chyung et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	196	1997 others able confirm observations Annaert et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	197	2 severe decrease Ass40 Ass42 secretion observed APP retained ER means double lysine retention motif APP KK
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	198	Since retention APP ER implies cleavage ss secretase residing TGN cell surface endosomes becomes strongly compromised since proteolytic trimming APP ectodomain prerequisite secretase processing Struhl Adachi 2000 seems logical APP KK mutation results strongly decreased secretase cleavage inhibition Ass generation
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	199	It consequence difficult interpret data obtained APP KK regard secretase sensitivity
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	200	Therefore generated APP C99 construct direct substrate secretase Lichtenthaler et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	201	1999 added double lysine ER retention motif
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	202	5 construct indeed retained ER codistributes abundantly PS1
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	203	Although expected increased Ass production significant amount Ass could precipitated wild type neurons Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	204	This result even significant neurons expressing APP C99 secreted seven times total Ass specifically Ass42 expressing APP WT
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	205	The possibility Ass generated APP C99 KK retained cells ruled since significant accumulation cells associated Ass could demonstrated Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	206	7 A lane 9 B lanes 2 5The possibility KK motif directly interfered secretase cleavage ruled two observations
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	207	First clear results APP ct cytoplasmic domain APP involved processing APP secretase
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	208	Second treatment cell cultures BFA could restore processing C99 KK clearly demonstrating inhibitory effect KK mutations trans cis phenomenon Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	209	It pointed PS1 ER already proteolytically processed presenilinase present PS1 CTF PS1 NTF Annaert et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	210	1999 thus putative active conformation
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	211	It follows data simple colocalization substrate APP C99 KK putative protease PS1 sufficient proteolytic cleavage
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	212	We conclude Ass production including Ass42 occur directly ER requires least one factor derived post ER compartment
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	213	This conclusion corroborated two important pieces evidence current work
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	214	First APP C99 good substrate secretase mainly localized PS1 BIP ERGIC53 negative subcellular compartment Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	215	Although characterization compartment requires experimentation result suggests least proteolytic cleavage APP C99 substrate occurs non ER compartment
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	216	The second important argument comes experiments using BFA
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	217	BFA drug causes redistribution post ER compartments ER Lippincott Schwartz et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	218	Treatment drug sufficient restore partially secretase processing APP C99 KK proving least one non ER component needed activate secretase ER Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	219	BFA treatment results secretase processing APP position Ass42 something could possibly anticipated based current knowledge Chyung et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	220	Surprisingly however cleavage position Ass40 also observed Fig
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	221	7 B believed occur mainly late compartments secretory endosomal limbs subcellular trafficking pathways Koo Squazzo 1994 Hartmann et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	222	Summarizing data indicate efficient secretase cleavage APP occur compartments contain little PS1 little secretase activity observed compartments abundant maturated PS1 residing
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	223	This surprising result since data currently available imply PS1 closely involved secretase type enzymatic activity De Strooper et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	224	1999 2000 Struhl Greenwald 1999 Wolfe et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	225	The spatial paradox PS1 localization secretase activity explained two hypotheses minute amounts PS1 post cis Golgi compartments active enzymes
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	226	This implies addition activation presenilinase additional proteins compartments needed make PS1 enzymatically active b PS1 actually secretase acts probably concert proteins ER intermediate compartment dispatch APP secretase subcellular compartment cleavage occur
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	227	In hypothesis BFA treatment results relocalization catalytic subunits secretase ER
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	228	In support first hypothesis evidence presence minute amounts PS1 compartments ER provided
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	229	In studies specificity antibodies used questioned Dewji Singer 1997 polarized cell types like MDCK cells Georgakopoulos et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	230	1999 specialized cell membranes like growth cones lamellipodia Schwarzman et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	231	1999 PS1 seems located near cell surface
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	232	1999 provided evidence PS1 travel complex Notch cell surface albeit conclusion based single type experimental approach
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	233	Furthermore hypothesis PS travels together substrates ER cell surface becomes activated probably tenable one takes account relative amount PS1 substrates extremely low Thinakaran et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	234	If PS1 needs accompany every substrate cleave ER cell surface becomes given limited amounts PS available cell type difficult understand strong overexpression APP saturate system lead inefficient secretase processing
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	235	Although remains impossible exclude minute amounts PS1 endosomes cell surface active enzymes clear hypothesis raises several new questions need addressed
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	236	In addition function inactive pool PS1 ER also remains explained
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	237	From BFA experiments follows least one component non ER compartment needed obtain activated PS1
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	238	This component elusive protease called presenilinase responsible PS maturation probably nicastrin since protein present ER Yu et al
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	239	The second hypothesis PS1 needed correct trafficking secretase substrates finds theoretical support analogy sterol regulatory element binding protein SREBP SCREB cleavage activating protein SCAP complex regulation proteolytical cleavage SREBP Brown et al

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	167	Only genotypic comparisons made refer Materials Methods showed allelic dose effect except East Asians table 3 thus allelic comparisons would proved less informative
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	168	These findings odds ratios close 1 even though significantly different 1 tables 2 3 suggest either linkage disequilibrium true risk factor confounding hidden interaction
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	169	The second possibility discussed
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	170	Regarding former Kehoe et al

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	186	Both diagnostic genotyping differences contributed heterogeneity
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	187	The former mainly due diagnosis possible Alzheimers disease reported poor record confirmation autopsy 38
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	188	The latter largely due certain genotyping methods may lead underreporting heterozygotes 27 28 shown Hardy Weinberg analysis
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	189	However greatest source heterogeneity ethnic differences
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	190	Ethnic stratification removed nearly heterogeneity table 3

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	200	Most examples disequilibrium North Europeans however excess heterozygotes Alzheimers disease requires another explanation
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	201	We believe explanation heterosis
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	202	Heterosis occurs heterozygotes show either greater lesser association given trait either group homozygotes
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	203	In case North Europeans excess heterozygotes Alzheimers disease association heterozygotes Alzheimers disease found
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	204	Comings MacMurray 42 suggested three explanations heterosis second applied
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	205	This proposes heterosis may follow inadvertent combination two unlike subsets due hidden interaction another unknown risk factor
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	206	To test proposal constructed mathematical model two equal subsets based median split unknown factor X table 4
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	207	The model illustrates although heterozygotes may intermediate odds ratios subset emerge highest odds ratio subsets combined
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	208	The overall results illustrative model table 4 close present meta analysis table 2
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	209	We stress however heterosis found North Europeans
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	210	Moreover although heterozygotes greater risk D homozygotes odds ratio 1
