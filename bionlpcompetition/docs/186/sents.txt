0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Mutations in the presenilin genes (PS1, PS2), the leading cause of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), cause highly specific alterations in intracellular calcium signaling pathways that may contribute to the neurodegenerative and pathological lesions of the disease.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying these disturbances, we studied calcium signaling in fibroblasts isolated from mutant PS1 knockin mice.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutant PS1 knockin cells exhibited a marked potentiation in the amplitude of calcium transients evoked by agonist stimulation.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These cells also showed significant impairments in capacitative calcium entry (CCE, also known as store-operated calcium entry), an important cellular signaling pathway wherein depletion of intracellular calcium stores triggers influx of extracellular calcium into the cytosol.

0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	22	 It is well established that presenilin mutations lead to increased production of the longer species of ss-amyloid (Ass) from the Ass precursor protein (APP; Scheuner et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	23	 APP mismetabolism, however, need not represent the exclusive or most primary consequence of presenilin mutations.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	24	 It remains possible that other pathological effects of presenilin mutations upstream of and/or independent of Ass generation may also contribute to the molecular and cellular changes characterizing AD neurodegeneration.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	25	Mounting evidence has established that presenilin mutations confer highly specific alterations in intracellular calcium signaling pathways.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For instance, a potentiation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated calcium signals has been documented in an array of experimental systems expressing PS1 mutations, ranging from Xenopus oocytes to transgenic animals (Guo et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Similar alterations have also been observed in studies of human fibroblasts harboring FAD mutations (Ito et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The calcium signaling changes in FAD fibroblasts are highly selective and specific for the disease, being present in affected individuals, but not in unaffected family members (Etcheberrigaray et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Moreover, mutations in PS2 produce alterations in calcium signaling indistinguishable from PS1 mutations (Leissring et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	30	 1999b ), providing further support that these changes represent a common pathogenic feature of all FAD-linked presenilin mutations.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	31	Several lines of evidence suggest that the dysregulation of calcium signaling conferred by presenilin mutations plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of FAD, underlying both the neuronal degeneration and the hallmark pathological features of the disease.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	32	 For instance, elevated levels of cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) in cultured cells can modulate the processing of APP and thereby increase Ass production (Querfurth and Selkoe 1994 ).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This underscores the likelihood that calcium dysregulation is at least one cause of increased Ass production, and thus possibly contributes to plaque formation.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, increased [Ca2+]i has also been shown to increase hyperphosphorylation of tau (Mattson et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Finally, altered calcium homeostasis is centrally involved in the increased susceptibility to cell death conferred by PS1 mutations (Guo et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	36	Despite the likely involvement of calcium disturbances in the pathogenesis of FAD, very little is known about the precise cellular mechanisms by which presenilin mutations alter calcium signaling pathways.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	37	 To address this issue, we studied calcium signaling in fibroblasts from homozygous mutant PS1 knockin (KI) mice.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In these genetically altered mice, the endogenous mouse PS1 gene has been replaced by the human counterpart containing the FAD-linked mutation, PS1M146V (Guo et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This model possesses many advantages over other experimental paradigms, since the mutant human PS1 protein is expressed to physiological levels, and the endogenous tissue and cellular expression pattern is maintained.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Hence, concerns about protein overexpression artifacts, ectopic expression, or confounding influences of the wild-type protein are obviated.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Here, we demonstrate that agonist-evoked calcium signals are markedly potentiated in the PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	42	 In addition, we report the novel finding that PS1M146V-KI cells show deficits in capacitative calcium entry (CCE), i.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	43	, the influx of extracellular calcium triggered by depletion of intracellular calcium stores.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Finally, we provide evidence that both of these alterations are attributable to an abnormal elevation of ER calcium stores in the mutant cells.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Thus, these findings provide a novel cellular mechanism to account for the calcium signaling alterations conferred by presenilin mutations, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for presenilin-associated FAD.

0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	79	Calcium signals in PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts differed from controls in several salient respects.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	80	 First, the rate of rise of the calcium signal was significantly increased (Fig 1, a and b, inset).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Second, the peak of the transient phase was significantly potentiated (Fig 1, a and b).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Finally, the sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i present in control cells was virtually absent in the mutant fibroblasts (Fig 1, a and b).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	83	Impaired Capacitative Calcium Entry in Mutant PS1 Knockin Cells The sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i in control cells resembles CCE, in which depletion of ER calcium stores triggers the influx of extracellular calcium through store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs; Lewis 1999 ).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	84	 To determine whether the sustained phase resulted from calcium influx, we stimulated cells with BK in calcium-deficient medium.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Removal of extracellular calcium abolished the sustained phase in control cells, but had little effect on the calcium signal in PS1M146V-KI cells, indicating that the sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i in control cells reflects calcium influx (compare Fig 1, a and c).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Notably, the initial calcium transients in both control and PS1M146V-KI cells, which reflect calcium release from intracellular stores, were relatively unaffected by removal of extracellular calcium (compare Fig 1, a and c).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Therefore, the potentiation of the initial calcium transient seen in PS1M146V-KI cells is attributable to increased release of calcium from intracellular stores rather than calcium influx.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	88	To determine if the sustained calcium phase reflected CCE, we treated control cells with SKF-96365, an agent known to block CCE through SOCCs (Merritt et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	89	 As illustrated in Fig 1 d, SKF-96365 treatment eliminated the sustained phase of [Ca2+]i in control cells stimulated with BK in calcium-containing medium.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Collectively, these data indicate that the sustained phase of elevated [Ca2+]i in control cells is CCE, and that CCE is disrupted in cells harboring a mutation in PS1.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	91	To quantify the magnitude of CCE after agonist stimulation, cells were initially stimulated with BK in calcium-deficient medium.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Subsequently, after the initial calcium transients had returned to baseline, the calcium-deficient medium was replaced with medium containing 2 mM calcium (Fig 2 a).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Relative to controls, the magnitude of CCE upon calcium readdition was significantly reduced in PS1M146V-KI cells after stimulation with 50 nM BK (Fig 2, a and b).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Intriguingly, in similar experiments using higher concentrations of BK (5  microM), the deficits in CCE in PS1M146V-KI cells, though still present, were significantly attenuated (see Fig 3).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Furthermore, no differences in CCE were observed after complete depletion of calcium stores with thapsigargin (TG; Fig 2c and Fig d, and Fig 3).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Thus, as illustrated in Fig 3, the magnitude of the deficits in CCE in PS1M146V-KI cells varied according to the degree and type of stimulation, with weak agonist stimulation eliciting the greatest deficits and complete store depletion eliciting no deficits whatsoever.

0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Since the trigger for CCE is the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, we hypothesized that CCE is impaired in PS1M146V-KI cells because their ER calcium levels are abnormally elevated.

0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	130	 In contrast, weak agonist stimulation barely triggers CCE in PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts because luminal calcium levels are abnormally elevated.

0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	132	In this study we investigated calcium signaling in fibroblasts from KI mice harboring a PS1 mutation linked to FAD.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Relative to controls, cytosolic calcium signals from PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts exhibited a significant potentiation in calcium released by agonist activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In addition, KI cells exhibited deficits in CCE evoked by agonist stimulation, but not by complete depletion of ER calcium stores.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	135	 We conclude that both of these alterations are attributable to the elevation of ER calcium content in PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	136	The agonist-evoked calcium signals in PS1M146V-KI fibroblasts are virtually indistinguishable from comparable experiments with human fibroblasts from FAD patients harboring PS1 mutations (compare our Fig 1 a to Figure 1 a in Ito et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Thus, the PS1M146V-KI animals faithfully mimic the calcium signaling changes seen in presenilin-associated FAD.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Importantly, since the mutant PS1 protein is expressed to physiological levels in these animals (Guo et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	139	 1999 ), none of the observed changes is attributable to protein overexpression.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	140	It is notable that, unlike human FAD fibroblasts, the cells in this study were isolated from neonatal animals.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	141	 This suggests that the changes in calcium signaling in FAD fibroblasts do not merely reflect secondary consequences of AD pathogenesis, such as the accumulation of mitochondrial mutations during the lifetime of the individual that have been shown to affect calcium signaling in cybrids transformed with mitochondria from nonfamilial AD patients (Sheehan et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Rather, our findings support the hypothesis that altered calcium signaling is an early and chronic consequence of PS1 mutations, one that may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of FAD.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	143	Although the present study was focused on fibroblasts, the potentiation of calcium transients has been described in neuronal cells from these same animals (Guo et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	144	 LaFerla, manuscript in preparation).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	145	 This strongly suggests that the alterations in calcium signaling observed in peripheral cells from FAD patients may be directly involved in FAD neurodegeneration and memory loss (Disterhoft et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This finding also supports the use of fibroblasts as a model to study the pathological alterations in calcium signaling associated with presenilin mutations.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	147	Our results suggest that elevated ER calcium levels are a fundamental cellular defect underlying the alterations in calcium signaling conferred by presenilin mutations.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	148	 As illustrated in Fig 5, we postulate that the higher levels of ER calcium in PS1M146V-KI cells would impair CCE by preventing agonist stimulation from depleting intracellular calcium stores beyond the threshold level required to activate CCE.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Moreover, this model provides a satisfactory cellular mechanism to account for several observations made in other experimental systems.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	150	 First, elevated ER calcium levels, by increasing the driving force on calcium across the ER, would be expected to increase the amplitude of calcium release transients, as has been documented in many systems (Ito et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Second, an increased driving force on calcium would also increase the rate of ER calcium release (see Fig 1 a) and would account for our observations in Xenopus oocytes that mutant PS1 increases both the rate of calcium efflux and the average quantal content of elementary calcium release events, the fundamental building blocks making up global calcium signals (Mattson et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Parker, manuscript submitted for publication).
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Third, because ER calcium levels can modulate the activity of IP3 receptors (Missiaen et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	154	 1992 ), elevated calcium stores may also account for the increased sensitivity of cells expressing presenilin mutations to IP3 stimulation.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Finally, an overfilling of calcium stores may also explain the interesting observation that long-term potentiation is altered in mutant PS1 transgenic animals (Parent et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	156	 2000 ), raising the specter that calcium dysregulation may underlie the memory impairments characterizing AD (Disterhoft et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	157	The mechanism by which PS1 mutations elevate intracellular calcium stores is not yet known.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Intriguingly, however, FAD fibroblasts harboring PS1 mutations have elevated levels of acylphosphatase, an enzyme that modulates the activity of the ER calcium-ATPases responsible for loading the ER (Liguri et al.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Thus, overactivation of ER calcium pumps may underlie the overfilling of calcium stores.
0.47290558.10811821.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Future research into the molecular mechanisms by which presenilin mutations increase ER calcium levels could uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	6	1, have been identified for autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) with onset age below 65 years (presenile AD).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We performed a systematic mutation analysis of all coding and 5'-non-coding exons of PS-1 and PS-2 in a population-based epidemiological series of 101 unrelated familial and sporadic presenile AD cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The familial cases included 10 patients of autosomal dominant AD families sampled for linkage analysis studies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In all patients mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) had previously been excluded.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Four different PS-1 missense mutations were identified in six familial cases, two of which where autosomal dominant cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Three mutations resulted in onset ages above 55 years, with one segregating in an autosomal dominant family with mean onset age 64 years (range 50-78 years).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	12	 One PS-2 mutation was identified in a sporadic case with onset age 62 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Our mutation data provided estimates for PS-1 and PS-2 mutation frequencies in presenile AD of 6 and 1% respectively.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	14	 When family history was accounted for mutation frequencies for PS-1 were 9% in familial cases and 18% in autosomal dominant cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Further, polymorphisms were detected in the promoter and the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 and in intronic and exonic sequences of PS-2 that will be useful in genetic association studies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	16	Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of senile dementia and the fourth leading cause of death in western societies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	17	 AD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive loss of memory and intellectual functioning due to the appearance in the brain of two major lesions: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The exact biochemical pathway leading to neurodegeneration is still unknown.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In most AD cases the first symptoms of memory dysfunction or behavior changes become apparent after age 65 years (late-onset or senile AD); however, in many cases the disease starts earlier in life (early-onset or presenile AD).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	20	 There are no indications that the disease in presenile AD cases is different from that observed in senile AD cases, apart from a more severe pathology and more rapid clinical progression.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Both senile and presenile AD have a genetic etiology; however, genetic cases are more frequent among presenile AD cases (for a review see 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Also, several AD families have been documented that segregate presenile AD in an autosomal dominant manner.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In these families a positional cloning approach has been employed to identify AD genes (for a review see 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	24	 To date, three AD genes are known that, when mutated, lead to presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21 at 21q21.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	25	1 (2 ); the presenilin-1 gene (PS-1) on chromosome 14 at 14q24.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	26	3(3 ); the presenilin-2 gene (PS-2) on chromosome 1 at 1q42.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Although the normal function of the amyloid precursor protein (app) is unknown, mutations have been demonstrated to alter endoproteolysis of app such that more of a 42 amino acid long form of amyloid [beta] (A[beta]42) is produced (6 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Rapid deposition of A[beta]42 in AD brains is an early morphological event in AD pathology.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Also, the normal and pathological functions of the presenilin proteins (ps-1 and ps-2) are unknown (for a review see 7 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Since they both constitute integral membrane proteins with six to eight transmembrane domains (TM) and one large hydrophilic loop (HL) (8 ,9 ), similar functions of ps-1 and ps-2 were predicted.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Remarkably, mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 also produce more A[beta]42, suggesting that PS mutations and APP mutations lead to AD pathology through a common biochemical pathway.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	32	In APP seven different mutations have been identified in autosomal dominant families with presenile AD or AD-related phenotypes (6 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	33	 All mutations occur in exons 16 and 17, encoding the A[beta] proteolysis product of app.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, extensive mutation analyses have shown that mutations in APP are rare, since they segregate in only 5% of the presenile AD families (1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Since the PS genes were identified more recently (for a review see 7 ), extensive mutation analyses have not yet been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, initial estimates based on linkage analysis studies suggested that 70% of the presenile AD families were linked to chromosome 14 (10 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Later, a mutation in PS-1 was found in each chromosome 14-linked AD family (3 ,11 ,12 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	38	 To date 42 different missense mutations and one in-frame splice site mutation in PS-1 have been reported in 82 families world wide (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Mutation screenings of PS-1 in presenile AD families not selected on the basis of linkage to chromosome 14 indicated that PS-1 mutations contribute less (30-50%) than initially estimated (14 ,15 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A possible explanation for the lower mutation frequency of PS-1 may be that the initial mutation data were biased towards finding PS-1 mutations, since most families analyzed had been included in a genome-wide search for AD genes and were known to be linked to chromosome 14.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Only one mutation has been reported in a proven non-familial AD case (16 ); however, only few mutation studies of sporadic AD cases have been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	42	Initial linkage studies indicated that PS-2 mutations are far less frequent than PS-1 mutations (5 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Apart from the one PS-2 mutation identified in the chromosome 1-linked group of Volga German AD families, only one other PS-2 mutation has been identified to date (5 ,17 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in contrast to PS-1 families onset ages in PS-2 families are highly variable and usually later in life (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that PS-2 families may have been missed, since presenile AD families with earlier onset ages are more likely to be ascertained for linkage analysis studies since they have more clear inheritance patterns.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	46	 To date no mutation reports of PS-2 in non-familial presenile AD cases have been published; however, PS-2 has been less intensively investigated for mutations than PS-1.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	47	In this study we aimed at evaluating the genetic contributions of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations to presenile AD in autosomal dominant, familial and sporadic cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To overcome several of the biases mentioned above we used a unique sample of 101 unrelated familial and sporadic presenile AD cases ascertained in a population-based manner in The Netherlands (18 ,19 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The sample contained 11 autosomal dominant, 56 familial and 34 sporadic presenile AD cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	50	4 years (range 45-64 years), being lower than 60 years in 71 cases and lower than 50 years in 10 cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In the autosomal dominant AD families all probands had an onset age before 65 years; however, in four families the mean onset age was above 65 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In addition we analyzed the families of 10 autosomal dominant presenile AD cases included in this population-based study (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In all cases mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene were previously excluded (19 ,20 ) while one family was shown to be linked to chromosome 14 (20 ).

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	69	 RESULTS Mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	70	Previously, the complete genomic structure of PS-1 and PS-2 was determined identifying 10 coding exons in each gene (21 ,22 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In order to avoid confusion we used the exon numbering 3-12 for PS-1 in this study, as introduced by Clark et al.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Intronic primer pairs were designed allowing PCR amplification of the 10 coding exons of PS-1 and PS-2 (Table 1 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	73	 All 101 AD patients were examined for mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 by SSCP analysis and PCR cycle sequencing.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	74	In PS-1 we identified four missense mutations in exons 4, 5, 7 and 9 respectively and one intronic polymorphism in intron 8 (Tables 2 and 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The Ala79Val mutation was identified in three patients (1005, 1061 and 1087) (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To test whether the mutation in the three patients has the same ancestral origin we genotyped three simple tandem repeat (STR) markers flanking PS-1 (23 ,24 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	77	 For D14S1028, D14S77 and D14S1004 all patients shared one common allele with allele frequencies calculated among the cases of respectively 0.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These data suggested that the three patients carrying the Ala79Val mutation might be related, although not closely, since genealogy studies had not indicated a familial relationship.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The other three mutations occurred only once and none of the mutations were present in the 118 control individuals.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The polymorphism observed in intron 8 is identical to that reported by Wragg et al.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	81	 (25 ) and allele frequencies were determined by the primer mismatch PCR assay described by those authors (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Since the SSCP pattern of the intron 8 polymorphism could have masked the presence of mutations, we sequenced exon 8 in all cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Restriction enzyme analyses of mutations and polymorphisms in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	84	 PCR amplified exons were digested with the restriction enzymes indicated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	85	 (A) Missense mutations in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	86	 (B) Polymorphisms in PS-1 and PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	87	In one patient a missense mutation in PS-2 was detected, resulting in an Arg - >  His substitution at codon 62 in exon 4 (Table 2 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Restriction digestion analysis showed that the mutation was absent in the other patients and controls.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In addition, SSCP and sequence analysis of exon 4 identified two different polymorphisms in intron 3 and at codon His87 respectively (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Also, the SSCP patterns observed for exons 3, 5, 7 and 11 were due to polymorphisms, since the nucleotide changes involved intronic variations or exonic silent mutations (Table 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The polymorphism in exon 5 (Thr122) was seen in only one patient and represents a very rare polymorphism.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Also, the polymorphism in exon 7 (Ser236) is rare, since it was seen in only two patients.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The allele frequencies of the other more frequent polymorphisms were estimated in the 118 control individuals by restriction enzyme digestion (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Comparison of the allele distribution in 15 control individuals showed that the two exon 3 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Also, the two exon 4 polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Further, we demonstrated that the PS-2 polymorphisms in exons 3 (Ala23) and 4 (His87) and intron 11 show Mendelian inheritance.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	97	To complete the mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 we developed flanking primers for the three exons located in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of PS-1 (numbered exons 1A, 1B and 2) and the two 5'-UTR of PS-2 (21 ,26 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	98	 SSCP analysis followed by PCR cycle sequencing revealed two polymorphisms in the 5'-UTR of PS-1, but no mutations (Table 3 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Allele frequencies of both polymorphisms were estimated by SSCP analysis of exon 1A and restriction digestion of exon 1B (Table 3 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Mendelian inheritance of both polymorphisms was demonstrated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	101	 No mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the 5'-UTR of PS-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	102	Although SSCP analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 was negative in eight of the 10 autosomal dominant probands included in our sample, we could not rule out that mutations may have been missed, since the sensitivity of SSCP is not 100%.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Therefore, we performed a mutation analysis of PS-1 and PS-2 cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from cultured lymphoblasts of a patient and an escapee.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	104	 No other than the Ala79Val and Tyr115Cys mutations in PS-1 were detected.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	105	All six PS-1 mutations occurred in patients with a positive family history of presenile AD, while the PS-2 mutation was observed in a sporadic case (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Two PS-1 mutations were present in autosomal dominant cases (1005 and 1066), while four PS-1 mutations were detected in familial cases (1061, 1069, 1072 and 1087) (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In the latter families the inheritance pattern was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	108	 2 ); however, these families had not been selected for linkage studies since they did not fulfil our rigid criteria for autosomal dominant AD (1061, 1069 and 1087) or showed bilineal transmission of AD (1072) (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Only in family 1072 were additional family members available and the PS-1 mutation Ala231Val was shown to be present in at-risk individuals.

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Families 1061, 1069, 1072 and 1087 had not been included in our previous linkage studies (20).

0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	117	In autosomal dominant families 1005 and 1066 co-segregation of the mutation with presenile AD was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (Table 2 and Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Previously we had used the informative families of the 10 autosomal dominant cases included among the 101 cases in genetic linkage studies (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Family 1066 (mean onset age 42 years) was linked to D14S43 located at chromosome 14q24.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	120	71) at zero recombination] (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Family 1005 was not informative for the chromosome 14 STR markers used.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	122	Mutation analysis of all 10 coding exons as well as the 5'-non-coding exons of PS-1 and PS-2 by SSCP analysis and PCR cycle sequencing identified four different missense mutations in PS-1 in six patients (Ala79Val, Tyr115Cys, Ala231Val and Glu318Gly) and one missense mutation in PS-2 in one other patient (Arg62His) among 101 unrelated presenile AD cases in our study.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	123	 All but one of the mutations (7 ,27 ) are novel mutations that were absent in 118 control individuals.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Based on our mutation data we calculated a mutation frequency of 6% for PS-1 and 1% for PS-2 in presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Since all PS-1 mutations occurred in familial cases, i.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	126	 cases with at least one first degree relative with AD, the mutation frequency is estimated at 9% (six out of 67 cases) in familial presenile AD cases.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Among the familial cases in our study there were 11 cases belonging to families fulfilling our rigid criteria for autosomal dominant AD, i.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	128	 three patients in two generations with a clinical diagnosis of AD in at least two cases (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In two autosomal dominant families a PS-1 mutation was found resulting in a mutation frequency of 18% (two out of 11 cases) in autosomal dominant presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	130	Since the mutation screening of PS-1 and PS-2 was performed by SSCP analysis, we cannot exclude that our estimates of mutation frequencies of PS-1 and PS-2 are underestimates, as the sensitivity of SSCP is not 100% (28 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	131	 However, we systematically analyzed each PCR-amplified exon of PS-1 and PS-2 together with positive controls of known mutations in the presence and absence of glycerol as denaturant.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Mutations in PS-1 and PS-2 may also have been masked by polymorphisms in exonic and flanking intronic sequences.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	133	 When polymorphic SSCP patterns were observed we sequenced the PCR products in five to 10 cases showing homozygous and heterozygous SSCP patterns.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	134	 In each case the underlying polymorphism was detected and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified product.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The efficiency of our mutation analysis strategy is demonstrated by detection of a mutation in exon 4 of PS-2 in one patient that had a unique SSCP pattern different from that of the polymorphic SSCP patterns observed for exon 4.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Also, sequence analysis of the polymorphic PCR products of exon 8 of PS-1 identified no mutations.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	137	The onset age in the PS-1 mutation cases varied from 45 to 58 years, with three mutations (Ala79Val, Ala231Val and Glu318Gly) having onset ages above 55 years (Table 2 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Most PS-1 mutations reported so far had onset ages between 35 and 55 years (29 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	139	 However, the majority of these mutations were located in exons 5 and 8, coding in part for TM II and the large HL after TM VI (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Here the mutations are predicted to interfere with the [alpha]-helical structure of TM II or the proteolytic processing of ps-1 occurring in HL VI (7 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The ps-1 mutations identified in this study are located in the N-terminal region (Ala79Val in exon 4), in TM V (Ala231Val in exon 7) and in the middle part of HL VI (Glu318Gly in exon 9).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Most likely these mutations have a milder effect on ps-1 functioning, possibly because the amino acid changes are semi-conserved (Ala79Val and Ala231Val) or they are located in a functionally less important region (Glu318Gly).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	143	 The Glu318 mutation is located in a region of ps-1 that is less conserved in ps-2 and ps of other species (13 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Also, co-segregation of the Glu318Gly mutation with AD could not be demonstrated, since no other relatives in family 1069 were available.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	145	 High variability in onset age was observed in PS-1 family 1005 segregating the Ala79Val mutation with a mean onset age in the family of 64 years, ranging from 55 to 78 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	146	 In one mutation carrier the disease was not yet fully penetrant at age 76 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Possibly, the onset age in this family is modulated by other genetic and/or environmental factors.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	148	 In this respect it is important to note that the non-penetrant case had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]3 genotype, which may have delayed his onset age (30 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, APOE studies in larger samples of PS-1 cases and families are needed to conclude that the APOE genotype modulates expression of PS-1 mutations.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Also, no effect of the APOE genotype on onset age was observed in chromosome 14-linked AD families with PS-1 mutations, leading to very early onset ages and severe phenotypes (31 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Another possibility is that the PS-1-linked phenotype is modulated by a polymorphism in ps-2 or that mutations in ps-1 and ps-2 act together to express the disease phenotype (digenic effect).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	152	 However, SSCP analysis as well as RT-PCR analysis of PS-2 cDNA did not detect sequence alterations in ps-2.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Family 1005 is also of particular interest since in this family several patients had been identified with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) (Fig.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, none of them carried the PS-1 mutation, indicating that the CVAs in this family are not related to presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In contrast to the previous three PS-1 mutations, the Tyr115Cys mutation in exon 5, corresponding to HL I, was detected in chromosome 14-linked family 1066, with mean onset age of 42 years (range 39-49 years) (20 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The latter provides evidence that some of the earlier mutation studies may indeed have been biased towards finding PS-1 mutations resulting in earlier onset ages and more severe phenotypes.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	157	Only one PS-2 mutation, Arg62His, was observed in a sporadic AD case with an onset age of 62 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The two published PS-2 mutations had been identified in autosomal dominant families with presenile AD in TM II and TM V of ps-2 (4 ,5 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The mutated Arg62 codon is not conserved in human ps-1 and ps of other mammalian species and is located in a region of the N-terminal domain that is generally not conserved between ps-1, ps-2 and the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog sel-12 (32 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Also, the mutation itself is a conserved amino acid substitution.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Therefore, it cannot be excluded that this ps-2 mutation is a rare polymorphism not related to AD pathogenesis, since the patient also had an APOE [epsilon]3[epsilon]4 genotype which may have increased her risk of developing AD (30 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	162	In conclusion, our mutation data showed that PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are rare genetic causes of presenile AD in general.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Also, the frequency of PS-1 mutations in autosomal dominant AD families (18%) is less frequent than initially estimated.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	164	 No mutations were identified in exons 16 and 17 of APP of any of the cases (33 ), suggesting that other AD genes must exist.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	165	 It is possible that a fraction of the cases may be attributed to the presence of an APOE [epsilon]4 allele.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	166	 In a previous study of this population-based sample we demonstrated that the risk for developing presenile AD is significantly increased in APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes independent of family history and in APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes in which the family history is positive (33 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In the sample of 101 cases there were 19 APOE [epsilon]4 homozygotes and 31 familial APOE [epsilon]4 heterozygotes.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	168	In contrast to previous reports (29 ), we observed several PS-1 mutations leading to AD with onset ages above 55 years.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Also, one of these PS-1 mutations was identified in an autosomal dominant family with a mean onset age of 64 years (range 55-78 years).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The identification of these PS-1 mutations predicts that PS-1 mutations with even milder effects on ps-1 functioning may be present in senile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	171	 This is of particular importance since a genetic association between an intronic PS-1 polymorphism and senile AD has been reported (25 ), although this association could not be replicated in all studies.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Possibly, the association is the result of a functionally more relevant sequence variation elsewhere in the PS-1 gene.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Preliminary data obtained by sequence analysis failed to demonstrate sequence variations in the coding region of PS-1 (25 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, the promoter and 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 had not been examined, since these sequences became available only recently.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	175	 In this respect the identification by us of two polymorphisms in the 5'-non-coding region of PS-1 is of interest, since these polymorphisms may be used in genetic association studies to test whether PS-1 is also a susceptibility gene for senile and/or presenile AD.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Also, the intronic and exonic polymorphisms identified in PS-2 are useful to test the role of this gene in AD, an analysis that has not yet been performed.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	177	 MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	178	All patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and onset at or before age 65 years, made in the period January 1980 and July 1987, living in metropolitan Rotterdam and the four northern provinces were ascertained (18 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The clinical diagnosis of AD was independently confirmed by two neurologists using a standardized protocol according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for AD (34 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	180	 A total of 198 patients participated in the study (18 ).
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Onset age was defined as the age at which memory problems or behavior changes were first noted.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Cases were considered familial when at least one first degree relative suffered from dementia.
0.3493169.9384602.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The percentage of familial cases in the total sample of presenile AD patients was 48% (18 ,33 ).

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In screens for extragenic suppressors of the sel-12 egg-laying defect, we have isolated mutations in at least five genes.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We report the cloning and characterization of spr-3 and spr-4, which encode large basic C2H2 zinc-finger proteins.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Suppression of sel-12 by spr-3 and spr-4 requires the activity of the second presenilin gene, hop-1.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Mutations in both spr-3 and spr-4 de-repress hop-1 transcription in the early larval stages when hop-1 expression is normally nearly undetectable.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	10	 As sel-12 and hop-1 are functionally redundant, this suggests that mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 bypass the need for one presenilin by stage-specifically de-repressing the transcription of the other.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both spr-3 and spr-4 code for proteins similar to the human REST/NRSF (Re1 silencing transcription factor/neural-restrictive silencing factor) transcriptional repressors.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As other Spr genes encode proteins homologous to components of the CoREST co-repressor complex that interacts with REST, and the INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferase) co-repressor complex, our data suggest that all Spr genes may function through the same mechanism that involves transcriptional repression of the hop-1 locus.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The 42 amino acid variant of ss-amyloid is highly insoluble and tends to aggregate, nucleating the senile plaques found in brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (reviewed by Sisodia and St George-Hyslop, 2002).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	22	Presenilin activity is also required for the S3 cleavage of Notch receptors after ligand binding (Struhl and Adachi, 1998).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Like the -secretase cleavage of APP, this cleavage occurs within the transmembrane domain and releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The release of the NICD is essential for Notch signaling, because the liberated NICD fragment enters the nucleus where it interacts with the transcription factor CSL (CBP, suppressor of hairless, lag-1) (De Strooper et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	36	In order to understand more about the biological role of presenilins, we have been studying the sel-12 gene in C.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Mutations in sel-12 were first identified for their ability to suppress a lin-12 gain-of-function mutation (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This suggests that sel-12 mutations reduce lin-12 signaling and that the SEL-12 protein normally facilitates lin-12 signaling (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	39	 However, mutations in sel-12 do not completely eliminate lin-12 signaling, presumably owing to residual presenilin activity supplied by hop-1 (Li and Greenwald, 1997; Westlund et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	382	     DISCUSSION TOP SUMMARY INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The difference in expression patterns may explain the phenotypes of sel-12 and hop-1 Although sel-12 and hop-1 have very similar biochemical functions and are interchangeable in transgenic experiments, mutations in sel-12 and hop-1 result in different phenotypes.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	383	 This suggests that although these genes may encode functionally equivalent proteins, the genes are not redundant.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	384	 The different phenotypes may be explained by their different expression patterns.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	385	 sel-12 is strongly and uniformly expressed, while hop-1 expression is dynamic and very low throughout most of the larval stages.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Thus, in the absence of hop-1 expression, there is still enough of (sel-12) presenilin activity at all times of development and, consequently, hop-1 mutants have only a very mild phenotype.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	387	 However, in the absence of sel-12 expression, there are probably insufficient copies of the hop-1 transcript in the early larval stages to compensate completely for the loss of sel-12 expression.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Therefore, sel-12 mutants only display postembryonic defects.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	389	All Spr genes may function through the same mechanism We provide evidence that the mechanism by which mutants of spr-3 and spr-4 suppress sel-12 loss-of-function alleles involves de-repression of hop-1 transcription in those stages in which hop-1 expression alone does not suffice.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	390	 Similarly, we have shown recently that SPR-1 and SPR-5 proteins interact, and that spr-5 upregulates hop-1 expression at the same developmental stages as mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	391	 This suggests that spr-1, spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5 all suppress sel-12 by upregulating hop-1, replacing one presenilin with another.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	392	 Similarly, mutations in spr-2 genetically bypass the need for sel-12, but do not bypass the need for both sel-12 and hop-1 (Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Although hop-1 activity is required for the suppression mechanism, Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	394	 did not find evidence for hop-1 transcriptional de-repression (Wen et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	395	 However, the stage specific de-repression of hop-1 transcription we have seen would not be detectable on a mixed-stage northern blot.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Thus, we propose that spr-2 may also bypass the need for sel-12 by the same mechanism as spr-3, spr-4 and spr-5.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	397	Upregulation of hop-1 transcription in the early larval stages can explain the suppression of sel-12 by spr-3 and spr-4 Mutations in spr-3 and spr-4 clearly de-repress the transcription of hop-1 in the early larval stages.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	398	 However, even in the suppressor strains, the absolute hop-1 transcript levels in the early larval stages are still much lower than in the adult stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	399	 We believe that the stage-specific increase in hop-1 expression is sufficient to explain why spr-3 and spr-4 suppress sel-12.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Even in a strong, putative null sel-12 mutant, there is sufficient HOP-1 protein in the larval stages to enable most lin-12-dependent developmental decisions to occur correctly.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	401	 In sel-12 mutants, the ventral uterine/anchor cell decision, lateral inhibition in the vulval precursors and the sex myoblast/coelomocyte decision are not affected (Levitan and Greenwald, 1995), indicating that there is sufficient presenilin activity, provided by HOP-1, present in many cell types.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	402	 In sel-12(ar131) even the cell fate is executed correctly in the vast majority of animals and in sel-12(ar171) it is executed correctly in some animals, while in a sel-12 hop-1 double mutants, 100% of animals have a defective vulval uterine connection (Cinar et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	403	 This indicates that in sel-12 mutants the expression of hop-1 is almost sufficient for wild-type cell induction.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	404	 Therefore, it is likely that small increases in hop-1 expression could be sufficient to compensate completely for the loss of sel-12 in all developmental decisions.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	405	There are also reasons to believe that small amounts of presenilin message may be sufficient to provide adequate levels of presenilin activity.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	406	 Presenilins are normally found as part of a high molecular weight complex (Capell et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	407	 This complex is assembled in the ER and Golgi, and proteins that are not incorporated into this complex are not targeted to the cell membrane and are rapidly degraded (Ratovitski et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	408	 Presenilins may be required in small amounts because the amount of other components of the complex are limiting for assembly (Edbauer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Consequently, it has been found that, in cell culture, presenilins cannot be overproduced (Thinakaran et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	410	 Furthermore, as the presenilin complex is thought to have enzymatic activity, the levels of the complex necessary for its biochemical function may normally be in vast excess of what is required.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	411	 Thus, even if the amount of the complex present at the cell membrane in spr; sel-12 double mutants should be slightly lower than the wild-type levels, the wild-type phenotype of the double mutants indicates that it suffices to ensure sufficient levels of lin-12 signaling.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	412	Is the increased expression of hop-1 in the early larval stages seen in spr-3 and spr-4 mutants sufficient to rescue the later larval defects seen in sel-12 mutants? We have several reasons to believe this is the case.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	413	 First, the cell signaling events that lead to the cell induction and the correct alignment of the sex muscles, occur prior to the developmental changes (Cinar et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	414	, 2002a) and presenilin activity is presumably required at the time of signaling.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	415	 Second, our initial experiments suggested that the relative expression of hop-1 is increased in the L1, L2 and L3 stages in both spr-3 and spr-4 mutants.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	416	 We chose to pursue this further at the L1 stage because we thought the upregulation of hop-1 expression might be most obvious at this stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in cell culture that, once assembled, the high molecular weight presenilin complex is very stable over a long time period (Edbauer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	418	 Finally, we have indications that the presenilin complex is necessary in small amounts and can persist for up to 24 hours in C.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	419	 elegans because we see rescue of sex myoblast/coelomocyte cell-fate decision in hop-1;sel-12 double mutants with maternally provided hop-1 (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Thus, presenilin protein produced in the embryo is sufficiently stable and produced in sufficient amounts for a cell fate decision occurring in the L2 stage.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	421	Do spr-3 and spr-4 perform a conserved function? Although SPR-3 and SPR-4 do not have clear mammalian homologs, they may be performing a similar function to known transcriptional repressors.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	422	 Both SPR-3 and SPR-4 resemble known transcriptional repressors, especially REST/NRSF (Re1 silencing transcription factor/neural-restrictive silencing factor) in different vertebrates.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	423	 The C2H2 zinc-finger factor REST mediates repression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells, by recruiting the co-repressor complexes Sin3 and CoREST (Humphrey et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	424	 Both of these co-repressor complexes contain multiple proteins, including histone deacetylases, and presumably repress transcription in part by removing activating acetyl groups from histones H3 and H4 at the target locus.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	425	 It is possible that SPR-3 and SPR-4 may also function by recruiting conserved co-repressor complexes to the hop-1 locus.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Three other Spr genes, spr-1, spr-2 and spr-5, encode proteins similar to components of known co-repressors (Eimer et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	429	 Human SET was purified as part of the INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferases) co-repressor complex, which helps to repress transcription by binding to histones and masking them from being acetyltransferase substrates for p300/CBP and PCAF (Seo et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Recently, it has been shown that upregulation of SET also inhibits demethylation of methylated DNA and may integrate the epigenetic states of DNA and associated histones (Cervoni et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	435	 We have shown that SPR-1 and SPR-5 interact biochemically in vitro and in vivo (Eimer et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	436	 This suggests that a similar complex is present in C.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	437	 elegans and functions to repress hop-1 transcription.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Interestingly, CoREST has been found to associate with at least two large, basic C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, ZNF217 and REST (You et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	439	, 2001), and may be a general co-repressor complex that is recruited to different loci in different cell types by binding to a different C2H2 zinc-finger proteins.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Recent work also suggests that CoREST may interact with components of the SWI-SNF complex (Battaglioli et al.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	441	, 2002) and may be involved in silencing of chromosomal regions (Lunyak et al.

0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	444	 The fact that loss of function mutations in either spr-3 or spr-4 suppress sel-12 and de-repress hop-1 transcription, suggest that both SPR-3 and SPR-4 are normally recruited to the hop-1 locus.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	445	 There they associate with co-repressor proteins similar to members of the INHAT and CoREST co-repressor complexes.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	446	 It is unclear if the two zinc-finger proteins co-operatively bind the co-repressor proteins, or if each zinc-finger protein associates with a different complex.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	447	 The assembled complex (or complexes), probably acts as a basal repressor of hop-1 transcription that is overridden in later developmental stages.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	448	The mammalian INHAT and CoREST complexes were purified and studied by biochemical approaches.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	449	 However, as yet little is known about their biological function.
0.49589044.12668626.html.plaintext.txt	450	 The data now available on Spr gene function suggest that INHAT and CoREST complexes can be studied both genetically and biochemically in C.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	5	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   We investigated the relationship between PS1 and -secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary cultures of neurons.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Increasing the amount of APP at the cell surface or towards endosomes did not significantly affect PS1-dependent -secretase cleavage, although little PS1 is present in those subcellular compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In contrast, almost no -secretase processing was observed when holo-APP or APP-C99, a direct substrate for -secretase, were specifically retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a double lysine retention motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Nevertheless, APP-C99-dilysine (KK) colocalized with PS1 in the ER.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In contrast, APP-C99 did not colocalize with PS1, but was efficiently processed by PS1-dependent -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	10	 APP-C99 resides in a compartment that is negative for ER, intermediate compartment, and Golgi marker proteins.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We conclude that -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 occurs in a specialized subcellular compartment where little or no PS1 is detected.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This suggests that at least one other factor than PS1, located downstream of the ER, is required for the -cleavage of APP-C99.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In agreement, we found that intracellular -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK both at the 40 and the 42 site could be restored partially after brefeldin A treatment.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This -secretase cleavage is a novel type of proteolytic processing, occurring in the hydrophobic environment of the cell membrane.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In the case of Notch, the cleavage results in the release of its intracellular domain that regulates gene transcription in a process that has been called "regulated intramembrane proteolysis" (Annaert and De Strooper, 1999; Brown et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	31	Several lines of evidence have led to the hypothesis that PS is the -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	32	 First, -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch is inactivated partially in PS1-deficient cells and completely in PS1/PS2 double to deficient cells (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	33	, 1999; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Herreman et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Moreover, mutagenesis of one or two aspartyl residues located in transmembrane domain 6 or 7 results in dominant negative to like effects on -secretase cleavage, suggesting that these aspartates contribute to the active site of PS (Wolfe et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Some similarities with the prepilin peptidases has been taken as further evidence that the PS are proteases (Steiner et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	36	 However, the strongest argument in favor for this idea comes from the observation that several compounds that inhibit -secretase bind specifically to PS (Esler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Nevertheless, direct proof that the PS can hydrolyze peptide bounds is still lacking.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	38	Remarkably, both Notch and APP apparently first need proteolytical trimming of their extracellular domain by TACE and -/ss-secretase, respectively, to become a substrate for PS/-secretase (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	39	, 2000; Struhl and Adachi, 2000).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These proteases are located downstream in the biosynthetic pathway and therefore both Notch and APP first have to leave the ER to become a substrate for PS/-secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Despite significant advances in our understanding of -secretase processing, it remains unclear how APP, after its cleavage by - or ss-secretase, becomes exposed to PS.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Moreover, Ass appears to be produced mainly in the endosomal compartment (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	43	, 1997), whereas PS is abundantly present in the ER and intermediate compartment (Walter et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This problem can be summarized as "the spatial paradox" (Annaert and De Strooper, 1999) and we now tackle this problem further by analyzing the processing of a series of APP-trafficking mutants in primary cortical neurons derived from PS1+/+ or PS1-/- mice.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We analyzed the consequences of restricting APP trafficking to certain subcellular compartments for the generation of total Ass and Ass42.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Constructs tested: (a) APP with deleted cytosolic tail (APP-ct); (b) APP with a double lysine ER retention motif in its cytoplasmic tail (APP-KK); (c) APP with a cytoplasmic tail from the LDL receptor (APP-LDL); (d) APP truncated at the ss-secretase cleavage site (APP-C99); and (e) APP-C99 with a double lysine (KK) motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The APP-ct is poorly reinternalized and stays for longer times at the cell surface (Tienari et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The KK motif acts an ER-retrieval signal (Jackson et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	49	, 1994) and therefore APP-KK colocalizes abundantly with endogenous PS1 (Peraus et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The APP-LDL recycles between the endosomal system and the cell surface (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	51	 APP-C99 is a direct substrate for -secretase and after addition of the KK ER retention motif (APP-C99-KK) we anticipated creating an excellent substrate for PS1/-secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Overall, our data confirm the spatial paradox in the PS-is--secretase hypothesis and provide evidence that the transfer of APP-C99 in a compartment downstream of the ER is needed in addition to processed PS1 to obtain -secretase activity in primary cultures of neurons.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Both full-length wild-type and APP-LDL chimera run as a doublet (Fig.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The majority for both the APP-KK and APP-ct recombinant proteins is, however, the immature protein.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This is expected for APP-KK, as the dilysine motif actively retains the protein in pre-Golgi compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The stronger immature APP-ct band could reflect the rapid processing of the mature form by -secretase at the cell surface (Tienari et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Next, we analyzed proteolytic fragments derived from the different APP mutants.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Secretion of the soluble ectodomain after - or ss-secretase cleavage generated from the different trafficking mutants was not significantly altered by PS1 deficiency, although the APP-ct, for instance, produced roughly twice as many APPs (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	64	 ss-Cleaved COOH-terminal stubs (APP-CTF) derived from APP-WT accumulated strongly in PS1-/- neurons (Fig.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Interestingly, the same relative accumulation was observed for APP-CTF derived from the APP-LDL chimera.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Also, total Ass secretion was severely decreased in PS1-/- neurons transduced for APP-WT and APP-LDL (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Although the secretion of Ass42 derived from APP-LDL is reduced by 80% in PS1+/+ neurons, in line with previous observations (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Perez et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	69	, 1999), the additional relative decrease caused by PS1-/- deficiency remained unaltered when compared with APP-WT (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Together, these data suggest that in the case of the APP-LDL chimera, the enhanced recycling in the endosomal limb does not directly influence PS1-dependent -secretase processing.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The intermediate band running between Ass and p3 in cells transduced with APP-WT corresponds to the truncated Ass generated by ss-secretase cleavage at the Glu11 position (Creemers et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	98	  The reduction of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in the APP-ct to transduced wild-type neurons is accompanied by an 80% decrease in secretion of total Ass and Ass42 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Moreover, no relative accumulation of ss-cleaved APP-CTF in PS1-/- neurons was observed.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	100	 All this can be explained by a predominant -secretase cleavage of APP-ct at or near the plasma membrane, as reflected by the increased secretion of APPs cleaved at the -secretase site and the concomitant fivefold increase in p3 secretion (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Interestingly, secretion of p3 is dramatically inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	102	 3, bottom), indicating that -stubs generated near or at the cell surface are still substrates for PS1-dependent -secretase processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Therefore, the data on APP-ct and APP-LDL clearly demonstrate that PS1 is needed for normal -secretase processing in the late Golgi region, at the cell surface, and in the endosomal compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	104	In contrast to the other mutants, the levels of APPs and of the COOH-terminal ss-stubs generated from APP-KK are very low, confirming the low - and ss-secretase activity in the ER (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Accordingly, the total Ass (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	106	 2 C) secretion was also strongly reduced by 90%.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, when overexpressed in PS1-/- neurons, secretion of Ass peptides was inhibited to the same extent as observed for peptides derived from APP-WT (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	108	To circumvent the need for "preactivation" of APP-KK by - or ss-secretase, we generated APP-C99-KK, corresponding to APP truncated at the ss-secretase site (Lichtenthaler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	109	, 1999) and containing the KK-ER retention motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	110	 When expressed in neurons, APP-C99-KK migrated with the same apparent molecular weight (10 kD) as the ss-stub coming from APP-WT or the APP-C99 without KK motif (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	111	 APP-C99, like APP-WT, can be processed by -secretase as reflected by the generation of -APPCTF (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	112	 APP-C99-KK, in contrast, is either not processed or processed very little by - or ss-secretase, confirming the specific retention of APP-C99-KK in the ER and cis-Golgi region.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In line with the prediction that APP-C99 does not require - or ss-secretase cleavage to become a substrate for -secretase, an estimated sevenfold increase in total Ass secretion (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	114	 This effect is also observed with Ass42, as detected by ELISA (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The -secretase cleavage of APP-C99 is strongly inhibited in the absence of PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Most surprisingly, however, was the observation that APP-C99-KK, which was also expected to be a substrate for PS1--secretase because it is retained in the ER, turned out to yield little if any Ass peptides (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	117	 It is unlikely that the KK motif directly interfered with the recognition of C99 by the -secretase complex, since the cytoplasmic tail of APP can be removed without affecting -secretase cleavage (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Moreover, C99KK becomes a substrate for -secretase under conditions specified below.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Alternatively, the low Ass secretion from neurons expressing APP-C99-KK might be explained by intracellular retention of newly formed Ass peptides.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Again, this could be ruled out, as no increased amounts of Ass could be immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (result not shown, but see Fig.

0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	170	 APP-C99 immunoreactivity was mainly concentrated in discrete spots that did not colocalize with the ER (C for BIP and arrowheads in L for PS1), and the Golgi region (merged panel I).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Occasionally minor colocalization with ERGIC-53 could be observed (arrowheads in D to F).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	172	  To test the hypothesis that a component of a more downstream subcellular compartment is needed to process APP-C99-KK in the ER, we treated neurons expressing APP-C99 or APP-C99-KK with brefeldin A (BFA), a drug that causes a rapid redistribution of the Golgi apparatus into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This treatment resulted in a drastic reduction in APP-C99 to derived Ass secretion, whereas no difference was observed in the case of APP-C99-KK (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, addition of BFA resulted in a strong increase in intracellular Ass generated from APP-C99-KK, towards levels indistinguishable from those obtained in BFA-treated APP-C99 to transduced cells.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	175	 This suggests that some unknown factors required for -secretase activity are redistributed from the Golgi region to the ER, which appears to be sufficient to partially restore Ass production from APP-C99-KK.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	176	 It has been suggested that Ass generated in the endoplasmic reticulum consists mainly of Ass ending at residue 42 (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Remarkably, although we detect little intracellular Ass under our experimental conditions (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	178	 7, A and B), treatment with BFA induces the generation of Ass peptides, ending at residue 40 as well as at residue 42 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	179	   Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References   Previous studies (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	180	, 1997) have shown that Ass can be generated at the cell surface and in the endosomes of neurons, where little, if any, PS1 is present (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The first aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent -secretase activity in these subcellular compartments depends indeed on PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	182	 To this end we expressed APP-ct and APP-LDL, two previously characterized trafficking mutants of APP (Peraus et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	183	 APP-ct lacks the endocytosis signals in the cytoplasmic domain of APP and is therefore only slowly internalized.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Compared with APP-WT, APP-ct is processed mainly by an -secretase activity at the cell surface (Sisodia, 1992; Tienari et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	185	 This results in the replacement of Ass production by a roughly equal production of p3, the product of consecutive - and -secretase activity (Figs.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	186	 2 and 3), confirming that the APP-ct construct indeed behaves as predicted.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Therefore, p3 production from this substrate reflects mainly -secretase cleavage of the -APPCTF at the cell surface.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Expression of this construct in PS1-deficient neurons resulted in a strong decrease of p3, demonstrating that -secretase cleavage at the cell surface depends on PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Since APPs secretion is not affected in the absence of PS1 (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	190	 3), we rule out the possibility that the decreased p3 production is caused by decreased -secretase activity in these PS1-deficient cells.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	191	APP-LDL expression selectively increased Ass40 secretion, as predicted from its preferential localization in the endosomes (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Peraus et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Again, in the absence of PS1, Ass generation from APP-LDL strongly decreased, demonstrating that -secretase processing of APP in the endosomes depends on PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It should be noted that we have not been able to detect any endogenous PS1 immunoreactivity at the cell surface or in the endosomes of the neuronal cells used in the current study (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	194	We next investigated whether we could increase -secretase processing of APP in the ER and the intermediate compartment, which contain the bulk of PS1 immunoreactivity in these neurons.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Although several authors have provided evidence that the ER is a production site of this peptide, in particular Ass42 (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	196	, 1997), we and others have not been able to confirm these observations (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	197	 2, a severe decrease in both Ass40 and Ass42 secretion is observed when APP is retained in the ER by means of the double lysine retention motif (APP-KK).
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Since the retention of APP in the ER implies that cleavage by - and ss-secretase (residing in the TGN, cell surface, and endosomes) becomes strongly compromised, and since proteolytic trimming of the APP ectodomain is a prerequisite for further -secretase processing (Struhl and Adachi, 2000), it seems logical that the APP-KK mutation results in a strongly decreased -secretase cleavage and inhibition of Ass generation.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	199	 It is by consequence difficult to interpret the data obtained with APP-KK in regard to -secretase sensitivity.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Therefore, we generated the APP-C99 construct, which is a direct substrate for -secretase (Lichtenthaler et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	201	, 1999), and added to it the double lysine ER retention motif.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	202	 5, this construct is indeed retained in the ER, where it codistributes abundantly with PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Although we expected increased Ass production, no significant amount of Ass could be precipitated from the wild-type neurons (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This result was even more significant, as neurons expressing APP-C99 secreted about seven times more total Ass, or specifically Ass42, than those expressing APP-WT.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The possibility that the Ass generated from APP-C99-KK is retained in the cells was ruled out, since no significant accumulation of cells associated Ass could be demonstrated (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	206	 7 A, lane 9, and B, lanes 2 and 5)The possibility that the KK motif directly interfered with -secretase cleavage was ruled out by two observations.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	207	 First, it is clear from the results with APP-ct that the cytoplasmic domain of APP is not involved in the processing of APP by -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Second, treatment of the cell cultures with BFA could restore the processing of C99-KK, clearly demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of the KK mutations is a trans, and not a cis phenomenon (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	209	 It should be pointed out here that PS1 in the ER is already proteolytically processed by the "presenilinase" and present as PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF (Annaert et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	210	, 1999), thus in the putative active conformation.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	211	 It follows from these data that the simple colocalization of a substrate (APP-C99-KK) with its putative protease (PS1) is not sufficient for proteolytic cleavage.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	212	We conclude that Ass production, including Ass42, can not occur directly in the ER and requires at least one factor derived from a post-ER compartment.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This conclusion is corroborated by two important pieces of evidence from the current work.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	214	 First, APP-C99, which is a good substrate for -secretase, is mainly localized in a PS1-, BIP-, and ERGIC53-negative subcellular compartment (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Although the characterization of this compartment requires further experimentation, this result suggests that at least the proteolytic cleavage of the APP-C99 substrate occurs in a non-ER compartment.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	216	 The second, more important argument comes from the experiments using BFA.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	217	 BFA is a drug that causes the redistribution of post-ER compartments into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Treatment with this drug was sufficient to restore partially -secretase processing of APP-C99-KK proving that at least one non-ER component is needed to activate -secretase in the ER (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	219	 BFA treatment results in -secretase processing of APP at position Ass42, something which could possibly be anticipated based on current knowledge (Chyung et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Surprisingly, however, cleavage at position Ass40 is also observed (Fig.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	221	 7 B), which is believed to occur mainly in the late compartments of the secretory and in the endosomal limbs of the subcellular trafficking pathways (Koo and Squazzo, 1994; Hartmann et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	222	Summarizing, our data indicate that efficient -secretase cleavage of APP can occur in compartments that contain little, if any, PS1, and that no or little -secretase activity is observed in compartments where abundant (maturated) PS1 is residing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	223	 This is a surprising result since most of the data currently available imply that PS1 is closely involved in -secretase type enzymatic activity (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	224	, 1999, 2000; Struhl and Greenwald, 1999; Wolfe et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The spatial paradox between PS1 localization and -secretase activity can be explained by two hypotheses: (a) the minute amounts of PS1 in post to cis-Golgi compartments are the active enzymes.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	226	 This implies that in addition to activation by presenilinase, additional proteins from these compartments are needed to make PS1 enzymatically active; and (b) PS1 is actually not the -secretase but acts, probably in concert with other proteins in the ER and intermediate compartment, to dispatch APP or -secretase to the subcellular compartment where cleavage will occur.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	227	 In this hypothesis, BFA treatment results in the relocalization of the catalytic subunit(s) of -secretase to the ER.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	228	In support for the first hypothesis, evidence for the presence of minute amounts of PS1 in other compartments than the ER has been provided.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	229	 In some studies, the specificity of the antibodies used can be questioned (Dewji and Singer, 1997), but in polarized cell types like MDCK cells (Georgakopoulos et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	230	, 1999) or in specialized cell membranes like growth cones or lamellipodia (Schwarzman et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	231	, 1999), some PS1 seems to be located near or at the cell surface.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	232	 (1999) provided evidence that PS1 can travel in complex with Notch to the cell surface, albeit that this conclusion was based on a single type of experimental approach, i.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Furthermore, the hypothesis that PS travels together with its substrates from the ER to the cell surface and becomes activated there is probably not tenable if one takes into account that the relative amount of PS1 to its substrates is extremely low (Thinakaran et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	234	 If PS1 needs to accompany every substrate that it will cleave from the ER to the cell surface, it becomes, given the limited amounts of PS available in any cell type, difficult to understand why strong overexpression of APP does not saturate the system and does not lead to inefficient -secretase processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	235	Although it remains impossible to exclude that minute amounts of PS1 in the endosomes or at the cell surface are the active enzymes, it is clear that this hypothesis raises several new questions that need to be addressed.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	236	 In addition, the function of the "inactive" pool of PS1 in the ER also remains to be explained.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	237	 From the BFA experiments it follows that at least one other component of a non-ER compartment is needed to obtain activated PS1.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	238	 This component is not the elusive protease called "presenilinase" responsible for PS maturation, and most probably not nicastrin, since this protein is present in the ER (Yu et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	239	The second hypothesis, that PS1 is needed for the correct trafficking of -secretase and its substrates, finds some theoretical support in the analogy with the sterol regulatory element to binding protein (SREBP) to SCREB cleavage to activating protein (SCAP) complex and the regulation of the proteolytical cleavage of SREBP (Brown et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	240	 SCAP is, like PS1, an ER resident, multitransmembrane domain to containing protein and regulates the trafficking of the membrane-bound transcription factor SREBP to post-ER compartments.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Upon cholesterol depletion, SREBP travels to the cis-Golgi, where a site 1 protease cleaves SREBP in its luminal domain.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	242	 The remaining NH2-terminal, membrane-bound fragment then becomes a substrate for a site 2 protease that cleaves in the transmembrane domain of SREBP (Rawson et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The coupling of vesicular protein transport and proteolysis provides a stringent control on the activation of the system and it could be envisaged that PS1, like SCAP, provides a similar control on APP (and Notch) processing.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	244	 However, it should be pointed out that in case of SREBP processing, SCAP regulates its luminal cleavage and that the site 2 intramembraneous cleavage occurs by default.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In case of PS1, its role is limited to the regulation of the intramembraneous -secretase cleavage (De Strooper et al.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	246	In conclusion, our data indicate a complex relationship between APP trafficking and its processing by -secretase.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Moreover, they directly question the exact role of PS1 in -secretase processing and demonstrate that at least one cofactor (in the first hypothesis) or the protease (in the second hypothesis) is located in a compartment downstream of the ER.
0.33943188.11502763.html.plaintext.txt	248	 In the future, reconstitution of -secretase processing of APP, by mixing extracts of purified ER fractions and post-ER compartments, should allow us to further define at a molecular level this highly intriguing proteolytic system.

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) co-segregate with a small subset of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) cases wherein deposition of the 39-43 amino acid [beta]-amyloid (A[beta]) peptide and neurodegeneration are principal neuropathological hallmarks.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To accurately examine the effect of missense mutations on APP metabolism and A[beta] production in vivo, we have introduced yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene encoding APP harboring either the asparagine for lysine and leucine for methionine FAD substitution at codons 670 and 671 (APPK670N/M671L), the isoleucine for valine FAD substitution at codon 717 (APPV717I) or a combination of both substitutions into transgenic mice.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We demonstrate that, relative to YAC transgenic mice expressing wild-type APP, high levels of A[beta] peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPK670N/M671L that is associated with a concomitant diminution in the levels of [alpha]-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Moreover, the levels of longer A[beta] peptides (species terminating at amino acids 42/43) are elevated in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPV717I.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These mice should prove valuable for detailed analysis of the in vivo effects of the APP FAD mutations in a variety of tissues and throughout aging and for testing therapeutic agents that specifically alter APP metabolism and A[beta] production.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	9	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major source of disability and death.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Genetic investigations have identified several etiologies for AD (reviewed in 1 ), including: a dosage imbalance for chromosome 21, as occurs in Down syndrome (DS); mutations in the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) on chromosome 21, the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14 and the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1 in autosomal dominant early onset familial AD (FAD); inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 allele on chromosome 19 as a genetic risk factor for both late onset FAD and sporadic AD.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	11	 A principal cytological hallmark of all AD cases is parenchymal deposits of [beta]-amyloid (A[beta]), a 39-43 amino acid peptide derived from APP (2 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	12	The APP gene encompasses 18 exons and ~400 kbp of DNA that gives rise to at least four tissue-specific alternatively spliced transcripts that encode proteins of 695, 714, 751 and 770 amino acids (3 -7 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	13	 APP, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein of unknown function, matures through the constitutive secretory pathway and is processed by several pathways, including: cleavage by [alpha]-secretase at position 16 of A[beta], resulting in secretion of the APP ectodomain, thus precluding A[beta] formation; degradation through endosomal-lysosomal pathways; cleavage by [beta]- and [gamma]-secretases at the N- and C-termini of A[beta] respectively, resulting in production and secretion of A[beta] peptides (reviewed in 8 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Missense mutations in APP occur in a small subset ( < 5%) of individuals with early onset FAD.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In two large related FAD pedigrees in Sweden (9 ) a double mutation at codons 670 and 671 (of APP-770) results in substitution of lysine for asparagine and methionine for leucine (APPK670N/M671L).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In ~12 FAD pedigrees (10 -16 ) mutations within the transmembrane domain lead to substitutions of either isoleucine, phenylalanine or glycine for valine at residue 717 of APP-770 (APPV717I, APPV717F and APPV717G).

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Cutting the plasmid DNA at a unique site (R) on one side of the mutation as well as introduction of the linear molecule into yeast containing the YAC and selection for Leu+ transformants result in targeted integration of the plasmid to the corresponding genomic sequence on the YAC.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	20	 (B) Subsequent selection for Cyhr transformants results in excision of the plasmid and generation of the wt or mutated sequence.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	21	 (C) High molecular weight DNA from a yeast strain containing the APP YAC and four representative ES transformants (see Table 1) were digested with HindIII, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with a human Alu repetitive element (5).

0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	25	Studies of transfected cells have provided enormous insights into the mechanism(s) whereby the FAD mutations affect APP processing and A[beta] production.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For example, cells expressing APPK670N/M671L secrete higher levels of all A[beta]-containing peptides as compared with cells expressing wild-type (wt) APP (17 -19 ); concomitantly, [alpha]-secretase-generated soluble APP derivatives are diminished (17 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, cells expressing the APP717 substitutions specifically secrete elevated levels of longer A[beta] peptides (20 ), extending to residues 42 and/or 43 [A[beta]1-42(43)].
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Evidence that A[beta]1-42(43) is a highly pathogenic A[beta] species derives from biophysical studies showing the highly fibrillogenic nature of the peptide and immunocytochemical studies of brains of AD and DS individuals, demonstrating that A[beta]1-42(43) peptides are deposited relatively early in the disease (21 -24 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	29	Numerous standard transgenic mice have been generated that express various wt and mutant APP cDNAs or gene fragments from a variety of promoters (reviewed in 25 ; see also 26 -28 ).
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although these studies have revealed that APP transgenic mice can develop age-related A[beta] deposits, they have not specifically and accurately examined the effect of the regulated expression of APPK670N/M671L and APPV717I on the metabolism of APP and A[beta] in vivo.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In contrast, our efforts were designed to introduce the entire ~400 kbp human APP gene harboring the FAD mutations into the germline of transgenic mice, thus allowing for the proper spatial and temporal expression of mutant APP with appropriate splice donor and acceptor sites needed to generate the entire spectrum of alternatively spliced APP transcripts and encoded proteins.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A 650 kbp yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing the APP gene was mutagenized using a homologous recombination strategy in yeast, introduced into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by lipid-mediated transfection and finally transferred into the mouse germline.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In brain and peripheral tissues of these mutant APP YAC transgenic mice high levels of human APP mRNA and protein are expressed in a manner that mirrors the spatial and temporal expression pattern of endogenous mouse APP gene products.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, elevated levels of A[beta] peptides are detected in the brains of YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPK670N/M671L, with a concomitant decrease in levels of soluble [alpha]-secretase-generated APP derivatives as compared with mice expressing similar levels of wt APP.
0.35055456.9285791.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of longer A[beta] peptides are detected in YAC transgenic mice expressing human APPV717I.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Presenilins are the catalytic components of -secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease whose substrates include -amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptors.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	6	 These type I transmembrane proteins undergo two distinct presenilin-dependent cleavages within the transmembrane region, which result in the production of A and APP intracellular domain (from APP) and the Notch intracellular domain signaling peptide.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Most cases of familial Alzheimer's disease are caused by presenilin mutations, which are scattered throughout the coding sequence.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Although the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet known, the familial Alzheimer's disease mutations produce a shift in the ratio of the long and short forms of the A peptide generated by the -secretase.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We and others have previously shown that presenilin homodimerizes and suggested that a presenilin dimer is at the catalytic core of -secretase.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Here, we demonstrate that presenilin transmembrane domains contribute to the formation of the dimer.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In-frame substitution of the hydrophilic loop 1, located between transmembranes I and II, which modulates the interactions within the N-terminal fragment/N-terminal fragment dimer, abolishes both presenilinase and -secretase activities.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In addition, by reconstituting -secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we provide evidence of an active diaspartyl group assembled at the interface between two presenilin monomers.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Under our conditions, this catalytic group mediates the generation of APP intracellular domain and A but not Notch intracellular domain, therefore suggesting that specific diaspartyl groups within the presenilin catalytic core of -secretase mediate the cleavage of different substrates.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Presenilins (PS)1 are components of a high molecular weight multimeric enzymatic complex, the -secretase (1, 2).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This enzymatic activity, whose identity has been elusive for some years, is responsible for the production of the A40/42 peptides.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The deposition of insoluble aggregates of A40/42, mainly A42, results in the generation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A peptides are produced after a series of proteolytic cleavages of the precursor APP, a type I transmembrane (TM) protein.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Cleavage of APP by - and -secretases generates the and C-terminal fragments (-CTF and -CTF, respectively), which are the substrates of -secretase.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The intramembrane proteolytic cleavage by -secretase on -CTF generates the soluble p3 peptide, whereas the same cleavage on -CTF generates the A peptides.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The more abundant A peptide forms, A40 and A42/43, are produced in a 9:1 ratio (reviewed in Ref.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mutations in the presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause familiar autosomal dominant AD (FAD), and to date, up to 145 missense mutations have been reported (available on the World Wide Web at molgen-www.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These mutations, scattered throughout the coding sequence, trigger a shift in the ratio of A40/42 production in favor of the longer peptide form (A42/43) (4, 5), which is less soluble and serves as the core for amyloid plaque formation (6).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In addition, -secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD) by cleavage at the site (7, 8).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	24	 AICD translocates to the nucleus, where, together with other recruited proteins, it initiates transcriptional events (9, 10).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Another type I TM substrate, the Notch receptor, is cleaved at the S3 site by -secretase.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This proteolytic cleavage, also within the TM region, is a key step in Notch signal transduction, since it releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) (11).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The analogous Notch S3 and APP sites are located within the TM region near the cytoplasmic domain (7, 8).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition, Notch also undergoes an additional -secretase-mediated proteolysis in the middle of the transmembrane region (S4 site), analogous to the A-producing -secretase cleavage (12).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	29	It is now widely accepted that PS1 and PS2 are the catalytic components of the -secretase complex, which appears to be an aspartyl protease whose activity resides at the interface between two presenilin fragments, the N-terminal (NTF) and the C-terminal (CTF) fragments (13, 14).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The NTF and CTF presenilin moieties are most probably produced by autocatalytic presenilinase activity and are more stable than the PS holoprotein (15, 16).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	31	 NTF and CTF heterodimerize with a 1:1 stoichiometry within the -secretase complex (17, 18), a complex that also contains nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 at an as yet undetermined stoichiometry (2, 19, 20).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	32	Many biochemical properties of -secretase activity are poorly understood, the most perplexing being its ability to cleave at two different sites within the transmembrane region of its substrates (the and cleavages of APP and the S3 and S4 sites of Notch) and the heterogeneity of the cleavage at the -site, which yields A peptides ranging from 32 to 43 amino acids (21).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although the presenilin catalytic center is composed of a diaspartyl group, the different inhibitory profiles of -secretase inhibitors obtained for A40, A42, and Notch cleavage suggest the presence of distinct catalytic activities (22 to 24).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition, some presenilin FAD and non-FAD mutations behave as gain-of-function mutations with respect to A production and as loss-of-function mutations with respect to AICD and NICD release (25, 26), supporting the hypothesis that both activities can be separated (25, 27 to 30).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Nonetheless, and despite the wealth of information gathered, there is still a lack of knowledge about the mechanism(s) by which FAD presenilin mutations, mainly located far from the catalytic site, are translated into subtle modifications in -secretase cleavage preferences.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Studies with different inhibitors have shed some light on the presenilin catalytic mechanism (31 to 35).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	37	 However, many issues related to substrate specificity, cleavage site specificity, and substrate binding site (or sites) remain to be clarified.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Several scenarios have been postulated to explain these intriguing findings.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Some reports argue that -secretase catalytic properties are incompatible with a single catalytic activity and propose that Notch and APP are cleaved by different proteases or by a protease with different catalytic sites (36 to 39).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In contrast, other authors propose that -secretase activity is performed by a unique, albeit particularly complex, enzyme.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This latter model has been recently expanded, since several newly described isoforms of some components of -secretase might allow the formation of more than four different variants of the -secretase complex (40).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	42	A new view of the -secretase complex was put forward by our group and others, providing evidence that the functional -secretase core contains two presenilin molecules (26, 41 to 43) and that presenilin FAD mutants may produce subtle alterations in presenilin dimerization and hence alter -secretase tertiary and quaternary structure (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In this report, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic transmembrane regions of presenilin contribute to the interactions within the dimer and that alterations of the dimer not related to the catalytic site, such as that affecting the HL1 domain, impair -secretase function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In addition, by reconstituting -secretase activity from two catalytically inactive presenilin aspartic mutants, we demonstrate that a functional diaspartyl catalytic group is formed at the interface of the NTF and CTF moieties from two different presenilin molecules.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	45	   EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   DNA Constructs The initial split ubiquitin constructs containing the wild-type Drosophila PSN NTF (amino acids 1 to 322) and CTF (amino acids 321 to 541) were generated from the Nub- and Cub-derived constructs (44) as described elsewhere (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In brief, a yeast centromeric plasmid was used to constitutively express the PSN NTF- or PSN CTF-derived constructs, which were fused in-frame to Cub-ProtA-LexA-Vp16.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The fusion constructs containing NubG fused to PSN NTF and to PSN CTF were cloned into a multicopy yeast plasmid under the control of the inducible CUP1 promoter.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	127	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Contribution of the Presenilin Transmembrane Domains to the NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF Interactions We had previously shown that Drosophila presenilin (PSN) forms a tetramer, with two NTFs and two CTFs (41), which should be more properly named a dimer, since NTF and CTF are processed products of a single molecule, the PSN holoprotein.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	128	 After an exhaustive analysis of presenilin domain interactions by the yeast two-hybrid assay, our results highlighted the contribution of the hydrophilic loop connecting transmembranes I and II (HL1) to the NTF/NTF homodimerization, although no similar domains could be defined for CTF/CTF or NTF/CTF interactions (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Presenilins show a very complex topology with eight transmembrane domains, which may also interact among them and contribute to the dimer formation.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	130	 To dissect the possible contribution of transmembrane domains, not only to NTF/NTF but also to CTF/CTF and NTF/CTF dimerization, we relied on an alternative strategy that had been specifically designed to test protein/protein interactions between proteins anchored to the membrane, the split ubiquitin system (44).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In this system, each of the proteins assayed for interaction is independently fused to either the N-terminal (Nub) domain, or to the C-terminal (Cub) domain of ubiquitin, which is in turn attached to the transcription factor LexA-VP16.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	132	 If the two assayed proteins did interact, they would bring together the two ubiquitin moieties, reconstituting the ubiquitin entity, which would be then recognized and cleaved by the cellular deubiquitinating enzymes, thus triggering the transcription of several sensitive reporter and selective genes (the his3 and lacZ genes) (44).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	133	 This strategy has already been successfully applied to detect and dissect membrane protein interactions of several proteins, including presenilin (41, 52).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Several requirements have to be met in order to analyze a series of transmembrane deletions in frame.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	135	 One of the requisites of this approach is that the Nub and Cub moieties of the ubiquitin have to be localized in the cytosol and that the Cub-LexA-VP16 fusion has to be at the end terminus of the protein fusion (44).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In addition, the presenilin molecule should maintain the topology in the membrane.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	137	 These requisites limited the number and combination of presenilin transmembrane domains that could be tested as they should be deleted in frame in even numbers.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	138	All of the combinations tested and the result of the interaction assay are depicted in Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by the absence of growth in yeast co-transformed with either PSN NTF-Cub-ProtA-LexA-Vp16 or PSN CTF-Cub-ProtA-LexA-Vp16 and another yeast ER transmembrane protein (Alg5-NubG) (as shown in Ref.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The main conclusion of these interaction assays was that the transmembrane domains did indeed play an important role in NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF dimerization, particularly transmembranes 3 to 6 of NTF and 7 and 8 of CTF.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	150	  In our previous work, we proposed that HL1 played an important role in dimer formation and, probably, in the conformation of the presenilin -secretase complex due to homomeric protein/protein interactions mediated by this domain.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In support of this, 14 of the 145 mutations in PS1 and PS2 cluster in this 32-amino acid loop, and all of the FAD mutations that we analyzed altered HL1/HL1 dimerization (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Nonetheless, the results depicted in Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	153	 1, A and B, suggested that the region comprising the N terminus-TMI-HL1-TMII domains was not required for NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions, given that its deletion did not affect the strength of the NTF/NTF or NTF/CTF interactions compared with that of wild-type fragments (as assessed semiquantitatively by growth on selective medium).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	154	 To further address the role of HL1 in NTF/NTF homodimerization, we undertook a new series of experiments to analyze whether the NTF/NTF interaction and dimerization would be altered when the HL1 loop sequence was substituted by another connecting loop so that the topology and relative position of all transmembrane domains were still maintained.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	155	 To this end, we generated an NTF variant, named NTF1 to 5, in which HL1 (amino acids 123 to 154 of PSN) was replaced by HL5, a shorter ER-facing connecting loop peptide of PSN (amino acids 261 to 267 of PSN).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	156	 This in-frame substitution did not alter the number of transmembranes or the connecting loops, and the general NTF topology should be preserved.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	157	 To directly test NTF/NTF interaction in the membrane, we again resorted to the split ubiquitin system, which we had previously shown allowed presenilin to be properly anchored in the membrane.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The interaction between different combinations of wild type NTF and NTF1 to 5 were assessed by quantification of the lacZ reporter activity (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	159	 According to these results, replacement of HL1 increases the strength of the NTF/NTF interaction, thus confirming the contribution of other domains to the formation and stability of the dimer and indicating that the HL1 may have a modulatory role on NTF/NTF interaction and thus in presenilin dimerization.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In contrast, none of the hydrophilic domains of the CTF domain seemed to be a determinant for any structural interactions, since they could be deleted without affecting CTF/CTF or NTF/CTF interactions (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	161	Expression and Metabolism of an HL1 Presenilin Mutant  These observations, pointing to a modulatory role of HL1 on the formation of the presenilin dimer, prompted us to further investigate the contribution of this ER-facing loop to the presenilinase and -secretase activities in vivo.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	162	 From the NTF1 to 5 variant, we engineered a new PSN mutant in which HL1 was substituted by HL5.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This recombinant PSN was named PSNHL1 to 5.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The addition of the HA tag at the N terminus of PSN did not alter presenilinase processing of wtPSN, which was endoproteolytically cleaved in both transient and stable transfectants.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	174	  We then tested the subcellular localization and protein stability of the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Immunofluorescent analysis in transfected SL2 cells revealed similar subcellular distribution, mainly in ER compartments, of wtPSN, PSNHL1 to 5, and the PSND461A mutant (data not shown).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	176	 To assess presenilin stability, total protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment, and cells were harvested at different times.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Immunodetection of lysates from stably transfected cells using an anti-HA antibody showed that the PSNHL1 to 5 holoprotein was more stable over time than the wtPSN holoprotein (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	178	 2C), since substantial amounts of PSNHL1 to 5 were still detected after 10 h of treatment.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This observation indicates that, in contrast to wtPSN, a proportion of PSNHL1 to 5 holoprotein pool is stabilized, similarly to other reported mutant presenilin holoproteins (30, 53).

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Previous control experiments in SL2 cells stably transfected with either wtPSN (positive control) or PSN single (PSND461A and PSND279A) or double (PSND461A+D279A) aspartic mutants (negative controls) confirmed the expression of these exogenous tagged PSN variants.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	182	 We then analyzed the production of AICD by performing a quantitative assay based on a -galactosidase reporter system activated by substrate cleavage (47).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	183	 We chose to assay -secretase activity by using reporter-based assays, since they are widely used to monitor signaling pathways mediated by cleavage in Drosophila, are highly sensitive, and can be easily quantified.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Besides, the same substrate in a similar assay has been successfully used very recently to characterize -secretase activity of PS1 variants (54, 55).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	185	Control assays using empty vector stably transfected cells showed detectable levels of -galactosidase activity, thus indicating endogenous presenilin--secretase activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	186	 To avoid the background by endogenous presenilin, we designed and performed RNAi experiments with dsRNA (250 bp) corresponding to the fused 5'- and 3'-UTR sequences of the Drosophila PSN gene.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	187	 This dsRNA was co-transfected along with the assay constructs in order to specifically knock-down endogenous PSN without altering the levels of the tagged exogenous PSN expression (as confirmed by Western blot analysis; data not shown).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Treatment with dsRNA targeting the endogenous presenilin produced a significant decrease in -galactosidase activity in stably vector-transfected cells, whereas the -galactosidase activity of the stably wtPSN-transfected cells remained unaltered (data not shown).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	189	 To assess whether the 5'-UTR-3'-UTR dsRNA reduced cleavage at the -site of the C99 substrate by the endogenous presenilin and therefore decreased A production, SL2 cells were transiently transfected with an SC100 construct encoding the C99 substrate (48) along with dsRNA.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Forty-eight hours post-transfection, medium was replaced to quantify de novo produced A peptides after RNAi treatment.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The production of A40 and A42 peptides was clearly reduced after dsRNA treatment (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	192	 3A, left), indicating an efficient disruption of endogenous presenilin activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Interestingly, the dsRNA treatment did not alter the production of the A42 peptide relative to total A, and thus, the A40/42 ratio remained unaffected in dsRNA-treated cells (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This decrease in the endogenous presenilin activity (as measured by A production) correlated with the accumulation of -CTF stubs generated by -secretase cleavage (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	206	 After several timing controls, cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection to allow both efficient RNA interference and endogenous presenilin protein turnover.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The -galactosidase activity, which measured AICD production (-cleavage), was obtained in mutant stably transfected cells and compared with that of wtPSN (which was considered 100%).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Remarkably, the -secretase activity in PSNHL1 to 5 stable cell lines, assessed on the C99-GVP substrate, was completely abolished, yielding values similar to those of the TMVII aspartic mutant presenilin, PSND461A (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This result showed that HL1 appears to be essential for the -cleavage of APP and, consequently, for AICD production.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	210	 We next tested whether the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant cleaved the APP-derived substrate to produce the A40 and A42 peptides (-cleavage).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Stable cell lines expressing different presenilin variants were transiently transfected with the SC100 construct, and A production in the cell medium was subsequently analyzed.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	214	 These results demonstrate that the HL1 of PSN is required for both - and -cleavages of APP.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	215	We then examined the ability of PSNHL1 to 5 to cleave a Notch substrate at the S3 site by using the same reporter-based strategy.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	216	 A Drosophila Notch-derived substrate lacking the extracellular domain (NECN) and fused to the transcription factor Gal4Vp16, NECN-GVP, was co-transfected with the aforementioned reporter constructs in SL2 cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	217	 The -galactosidase activity was significantly decreased in the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant (as it was in the PSND461A mutant) compared with wtPSN (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Altogether, these results confirmed that indeed the HL1 domain plays a modulating role in the presenilin dimerization and showed that substitution of HL1 by another connecting domain resulted in a complete loss of -secretase function concerning presenilinase activity, the - and -cleavages of APP, as well as the S3 cleavage of Notch, without affecting PSN stability.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	219	The Aspartic Residues Asp279 and Asp461 from Different Presenilin Holoproteins Constitute an Active Catalytic Center  Our results indicate that correct presenilin dimerization is required for -secretase function, probably as a means to ensure a correct positioning of the transmembrane domains and, hence, of the aspartic residues in the catalytic core.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Presenilin dimerization would bring together four aspartic residues, two from each monomer, thus allowing different combinations of functional aspartyl groups at the catalytic core of -secretase.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Several points are raised by this model, not the least being whether the presenilin dimer is a requirement for -secretase activity and, if so, whether all four aspartic residues are required for -secretase activity or only two aspartic residues will be sufficient for cleavage.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	222	 If the latter was the case, new questions are posed, such as whether any diaspartyl combinations are equally functional or whether specific diaspartyl groups mediate substrate recognition and/or cleavage site preferences.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The proposed presenilin quaternary conformation (26, 41, 42) enables the formation of up to six catalytic diaspartyl groups within the -secretase complex (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	224	 4A; some reciprocal diaspartyl combinations are not shown for simplicity).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The assembly of functional diaspartyl groups involving either two TMVI aspartic residues (Asp257 in human PS1, corresponding to Asp279 in Drosophila PSN) or the two aspartic residues from TM VII (Asp385 in human PS1, corresponding to Asp461 in Drosophila PSN) can be discarded (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	226	 4A, schemes on the left), since PS aspartic mutants D257A and D385A have been clearly shown to impair presenilinase and -secretase activities (reviewed in Ref.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	227	 56), and expression of either NTF or CTF peptides in PS-deficient cells is not able to cleave an APP-derived substrate (55).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Therefore, besides the expected diaspartyl groups formed between the NTF and the CTF within each monomer (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Statistical significance according to the U-Mann Whitney Test was as follows: *, p  <  0.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	244	  We designed an experimental approach based on genetic complementation between two different aspartic mutants to assess whether the TMVI aspartic residue (Asp279 in Drosophila PSN/Asp257 in human PS1) from one monomer formed a functional diaspartyl group with the TMVII aspartic residue (Asp461 in Drosophila PSN/Asp385 in human PS1) from the other.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	245	 If this were the case, we should be able to reconstitute -secretase activity from the two catalytically inactive aspartic mutants, thus providing further evidence that presenilins functions as a dimer in vivo and that at least two aspartic residues are required.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	246	 To our knowledge, this possibility has not been formally tested before.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	247	 We constructed a double cassette expression plasmid to stably co-express two presenilin mutants, HA-PSND279A and c-Myc-PSND461A, in SL2 cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	248	 To assess -secretase activity, we analyzed the production of AICD, A, and NICD using the corresponding substrates.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In cells stably expressing both PSN mutants, we predicted the formation of three different complexes: the inactive homodimers containing the same mutation and thus containing either two 461 or two 279 aspartic residues (HA-PSND279A/HA-PSND279A and Myc-PSND461A/Myc-PSND461A, respectively) and the heterodimeric complex with one aspartic 461 and one aspartic 279 (HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A), at a 1:1:2 ratio.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	250	 If a functional catalytic site were formed between the two mutant monomers, we would expect that the presenilin heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A would produce one or more of the presenilin-dependent cleavage products (AICD, NICD, and A40/42).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	251	We first analyzed the expression levels of different presenilin mutants in stably transfected SL2 cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed high levels of expression of the HA-tagged (Fig.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	254	 4B, right), even when co-expressed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	255	 In contrast to cells co-expressing HA-wtPSN and c-Myc-wtPSN, no presenilinase activity was detected when the HA-PSND279A and c-Myc-PSND461A mutants were co-expressed (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Thus, no presenilinase activity was reconstituted, and only mutant presenilin holoproteins could assemble at the dimer core of the -secretase complex in these cells.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	257	To evaluate the production of AICD generated by the -cleavage activity, stable cell lines were co-transfected with the C99-GVP substrate and the corresponding reporter constructs.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Interestingly, we observed that, in contrast to the -galactosidase activities of the single and double aspartic D279A and D461A mutants, co-expression of both single mutant presenilins resulted in a significantly higher -secretase activity (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	259	 4C), amounting to 50% of the wild-type presenilin value.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	260	 This result shows that co-expression of the two mutants, PSND279A and PSND461A, restores AICD production, providing strong evidence that an active catalytic site is formed between the NTF and the CTF aspartics from different presenilins within the same complex.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Similarly, the production of A40/42 from the C99 substrate was determined.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Again, and in contrast to the abolition of A40 and A42 production in cells expressing only one single (either PSND279A or PSND461A) or double (PSND279A+D461A) aspartic mutants, coexpression of the two PSN mutants restored the production of the A40 and A42 to the same level as endogenous PSN in cells untreated with dsRNA (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	263	 4D), around 25 to 30% of that achieved by overexpression of wtPSN.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Furthermore, the A40/42 ratio in cells expressing the combination of both aspartic mutants was similar to that of wtPSN (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	265	 The rescue of -secretase activity due to the co-expression of the two aspartic mutants was further confirmed by a significant reduction of -CTFs levels in these cells compared with cells expressing each mutant, PSND279A and PSND461A, alone (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Note the statistical significance of the decrease in the -CTF levels when co-expressing the two mutants (lane 5), compared with those of the single or double mutants expressed on their own (lanes 2 to 4, which were not statistically different among them).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	267	To assess S3 cleavage, we performed a similar series of experiments with the NECN-GVP substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Remarkably, and in contrast to the APP-derived C99 substrate, the co-expression of the PSND279A and PSND461A mutants did not restore NICD production (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	269	 In fact, the null values obtained were comparable with those for the single PSND461A mutant.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Taken together, these results indicate that the functional diaspartyl group formed between the NTF and CTF from two different presenilins restore -secretase activity, at least to mediate and cleavages of C99, but also that this diaspartyl group may display substrate specificity, since it is able to discriminate between the two substrates, C99 and NECN.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	271	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The aim of this study was to provide evidence to support that a presenilin dimer is the catalytic core of the functional -secretase complex.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	272	 To this end, we focused on two different aspects of the presenilin protein, structure and function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	273	 On the one hand, we assessed the contribution of the transmembrane domains to NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF interactions and analyzed the functional consequences of substituting a short region putatively involved in modulating NTF/NTF homodimerization, and on the other, we explored the contribution of the potential diaspartyl catalytic groups predicted from the dimeric presenilin to -secretase function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	274	Evidence for presenilin dimerization was first gathered from yeast two-hybrid assays, which mostly assessed the ability of hydrophilic domains and large presenilin fragments to selfassociate (41, 42).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Nonetheless, exhaustive analysis of in situ interactions performed in membrane-anchored presenilin domains to study the contribution of the hydrophobic transmembranes to dimerization was missing.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The split ubiquitin system (44) allowed us to design a test for assaying different combinations of TM regions, grouped by even numbers in order to preserve the general presenilin topology and the cytosolic/lumen direction of the domains.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Our results show that presenilin transmembrane domains are relevant for interactions within the NTF/NTF, CTF/CTF, and NTF/CTF dimers, either for assembly or stabilization, and therefore for the maintenance of the tertiary and quaternary presenilin structure.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	278	 In this context, the fact that the hydrophobic domains are the most evolutionarily conserved presenilin regions and that FAD mutations are mainly concentrated on these transmembrane domains indicate that even conservative changes may cause subtle disturbances in dimerization and final quaternary structure, which are then reflected in shifts of the substrate cleavage sites.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	279	Previous results from our group showed that the HL1 domain (the hydrophilic loop connecting TMI and TMII) from two NTFs interacted and were involved in NTF/NTF homodimerization (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	280	 In addition to being the largest ER-facing loop, the highly evolutionarily conserved HL1 domain is the presenilin hydrophilic region that clusters the highest number of FAD mutations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Remarkably, the FAD mutations analyzed altered the formation of the HL1 HL1 complex (41).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	282	 The substitution of this domain increased NTF/NTF interaction, thus indicating that, more than being a requirement for interaction, it may rather play a modulatory role in dimerization as a means to achieve a correct presenilin tertiary or quaternary structure.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	283	 We therefore focused on this domain to assess its contribution to presenilin structure and function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Interestingly, substitution of HL1 for another ER-hydrophilic connecting loop, HL5, which presumably generates a topologically equivalent presenilin protein, totally inhibited presenilinase activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In addition, production of AICD, A, and NICD was completely absent in cells expressing this PSN variant.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	286	 This abrogation of presenilinase and -secretase activities was not due to increased presenilin instability, since the PSNHL1 to 5 mutant holoprotein was still detected after 10 h of cycloheximide treatment, thus proving to be much more stable than the wtPSN holoprotein.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inhibition of the -secretase activity in this PSN mutant is a secondary effect of the lack of presenilin endoproteolysis, we do not favor this explanation, since presenilinase and -secretase activities do not necessarily correlate (30, 57).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Another presenilin variant lacking HL1 has been analyzed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	289	 The TM1 to 2 PS1 mutant (with a deletion comprising the TMI-HL1-TMII regions) was able to generate the A peptides (30), although the maturation and trafficking of the -secretase complex components were highly altered.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	290	 A similar effect of our PSNHL1 to 5 mutant could be assumed.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	291	 However, we deem it unlikely, since the presenilin transmembrane regions, integrally maintained in the PSNHL1 to 5 but not in the TM1 to 2 mutant, mediate the interactions within the -secretase complex (58 to 60).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Recently, it has been suggested that presenilin endoproteolysis is a regulatory event that causes a cleavage-induced conformational change by which presenilin becomes an activated enzyme (61).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	293	 According to this report, the presenilinase cleavage would retrieve the loop encoded by exon 9, which would otherwise occupy the presenilin substrate-binding site.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	294	 If this was the case, we should then surmise that the TM1 to 2 mutant adopted a conformation that relieved the exon 9 peptide from the binding pocket, whereas the conformation of the PSNHL1 to 5 variant allowed neither endoproteolysis processing nor the retrieval of exon 9 peptide; hence, -secretase activity might be severely compromised.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	295	In any case, complete loss of presenilinase and -secretase activities has been previously achieved by mutating the catalytic aspartic residues; by altering the C-terminal region, which appears to be relevant for presenilin stability; or by altering the regions proximal to the presenilinase catalytic site (16, 53 to 55, 62).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Here, we show that the alteration of a region located far from the catalytic site and not involved in presenilin stability causes inhibition of presenilinase and -secretase functions.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Hence, substitution of HL1, which plays an important role on PSN structure and assembly, has devastating functional effects and suggests that proper presenilin dimerization and assembly within the -secretase complex is essential for its proteolytic function.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	298	 In this context, FAD mutations located in HL1 may subtly alter presenilin dimerization and positioning of transmembranes and, thus, generate a shift on the substrate cleavage site preferences.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	299	One prediction of the presenilin dimer in the -secretase core is the formation of more than one catalytic diaspartyl group.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	300	 We addressed whether all the diaspartyl combinations were functional.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Our results showed reconstitution of active -secretase when two different presenilin aspartic mutants were co-expressed, as a functional diaspartyl group was formed with the TMVI Asp279 aspartic residue (Asp257 in human PS1) from one PSN monomer and the TMVII D461 aspartic residue (Asp385 in human PS1) from the other (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Not only did this diaspartyl group cleave the C99-APP-derived substrate at both - and -sites, but it also produced A40 and A42 peptides in the same ratio as the wtPSN, thus suggesting that a similar diaspartyl combination is responsible for APP - and -cleavages in vivo.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Remarkably, the fact that in the same experimental conditions this catalytic group does not generate NICD by S3 cleavage supports the idea that different requirements have to be met for APP and Notch cleavages, in agreement with previous reports (25, 27 to 29, 63).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	304	 In addition, our results suggest that presenilinase activity requires the formation of a diaspartyl group between the NTF and CTF from the same monomer.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	305	 According to our results, endoproteolytic processing is no longer a requirement for presenilin activation when co-expressing the two presenilin aspartic mutants.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	306	 These presenilin aspartic mutants might adopt a slightly different conformation that would not need to retrieve exon 9 from the binding substrate site (61).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	307	We have ruled out some possible concerns about the reconstitution of -secretase activity in our experimental conditions on the following grounds: (i) we discarded any domain swapping between the two mutant presenilin molecules, first because this event has already been ruled out in presenilins by several authors in previous reports (26, 64, 65), and, moreover, in our case presenilin domain swapping was completely prevented, since the expressed mutants were not endoproteolytically cleaved into the NTF and CTF fragments; (ii) even if considering some residual endogenous presenilin-dependent or -independent -secretase activity after RNAi treatment and the fact that not all presenilin mutants might be equally effective in replacing this residual activity, the fact that each individual mutant abrogated -secretase activity, as measured by loss of A, AICD, and NICD production (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	308	 4, C, D, and G), whereas in the same experimental conditions co-expression of the two mutants restored between 30 and 50% of the wild-type activity (in accordance with the heterodimer PSND279A/PSND461A representing only one-half of the dimer population), indicated that genetic complementation between the two mutants occurred, and a functional diaspartyl group was assembled in trans; and finally, (iii) this reconstituted -secretase activity only cleaved the APP-derived substrates, whereas the activity on Notch-derived ones was completely impaired.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Were other presenilin-independent activities to account for the APP processing but not for Notch cleavage, these activities should be detected in all of the mutant controls, which obviously was not the case.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	310	Hence, the fact that -secretase activity is restored only after co-expression of the two aspartic mutant presenilins within the same cell and that this activity discriminates between the two substrates, in contrast to the wild-type or endogenous presenilin, makes complementation of the two presenilin mutants the highest likely explanation for the restoration of -secretase activity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	311	 We concluded that the reconstituted presenilin catalytic function was due to the bona fide formation of a diaspartyl group in trans at the interface of the two mutant presenilins, each providing one different aspartic residue.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Our results are also completely consistent and provide a feasible explanation for the recent report on the rescue of presenilinase and -secretase activity on a C99 substrate by co-expression of an inactive C-terminally truncated presenilin mutant with wild-type CTF, but not by a mutant aspartic CTF, in PS-deficient cells (54).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	313	Based on our results, we propose a model in which the catalytic diaspartyl groups responsible for cleaving these substrates partially overlap within the same presenilin -secretase complex.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Thus, the Asp257/Asp385 group formed in trans at the interface of the two presenilin monomers would cleave a C99 substrate, whereas the Asp257/Asp385 group in cis between the NTF and CTF moieties of the same molecule would process an NECN substrate (Fig.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The experimental approach with the two aspartic mutants did not allow to test the second possibility.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	316	 This hypothesis is consistent with the divergent transmembrane sequences of both substrates, which, according to our model, would be cleaved by different diaspartyl combinations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	317	 It should be noted that the observations presented here are fully compatible with the recently proposed models in which -secretase may contain separated docking and catalytic sites (26, 35, 66 to 68).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Other scenarios are also compatible with our observations.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	319	 One is that the conformation of the HA-PSND279A/Myc-PSND461A heterodimer hinders the access to the catalytic site of the NECN substrate, but not that of the C99.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	320	 In this context, if the conformations of the mutants were slightly different from the wild-type protein, mutations on the catalytic site could alter in turn the accessibility to the binding site, allowing the access of C99 but still hampering that of the NECN substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	321	 A second alternative might be that the mutant presenilins are addressed to a cellular compartment different from the wild type, allowing access to the APP-derived substrate while precluding that of the Notch substrate.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Another alternative is that recognition and/or cleavage of the NECN substrate requires at least three aspartic residues of the presenilin dimer, similar to what has been suggested (26).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Finally, other authors have proposed that different isoforms (PS-1, PS-2, aph-1aL, aph-1aS, and aph-1b) assemble in different -secretase complexes to provide substrate specificity (40).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	324	 This does not apply to our model because the components of the -secretase complex are encoded by single copy genes in Drosophila (2).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	325	 Notwithstanding, and irrespective of the number and composition of the -secretase complexes, once the substrate has reached the catalytic center, it may be cleaved by a specific diaspartyl group, which could differ between different substrates.

0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	328	 The diaspartyl group formed by one aspartic acid 257 and one aspartic acid 385 (in black) from two presenilin molecules cleaves a C99 substrate (A) both at the - and -sites, whereas an NECN substrate (B) is cleaved by the diaspartyl group (in black) formed with the NTF and CTF from the same monomer.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	329	 The numbering is according to human PS1.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	330	  The FAD mutations analyzed to date do not alter the presenilin-mediated -secretase cleavages (-site, -site, and S3 site) in the same manner, again suggesting that the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating -secretase activities are very complex (25 to 27).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	331	 All of these FAD mutations alter the A42/40 ratio, whereas their effects on NICD and AICD production are more variable.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	332	 According to our model, each presenilin FAD mutation would have a specific effect on each diaspartyl combination, thus entailing a shift in cleavage site preferences or even substrate affinity.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	333	Presenilins belong to an emerging family of unusual diaspartyl proteases, the I-CLiPs (56, 69), whose characteristics include complex structural topology and the ability to carry out regulated intramembraneous proteolysis of substrates (70).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Remarkably, another of its members, the signal peptide peptidase, has been recently reported to form a homodimer that is labeled by inhibitors directed against the active site of -secretase (71).
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	335	 The finding that two aspartyl I-CLiPs, signal peptide peptidase and presenilins, function as dimers that are recognized by the same active site inhibitor suggests that dimerization may be a general requirement for function or regulation of this family of proteases and provides new insights on how regulated intramembraneous proteolysis may take place.
0.6103489.15220354.html.plaintext.txt	336	To sum up and as a main conclusion, we reconstituted -secretase activity through co-expression of two distinct, catalytically inactive, aspartic presenilin mutants and provided evidence that presenilin functions as a dimer within the -secretase complex and that a functional diaspartyl group is formed at the interface of this dimer.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Department of Neurology and Division of Neuroscience, The Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, March 15, 2005 , and in revised form, August 8, 2005.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It has been proposed that -secretase-mediated release of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) results in nuclear translocation and signaling through a complex with the adaptor protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Here, we show that APP and Fe65 activate transcription through a Gal4-Tip60 reporter in presenilin-1/2-deficient cells lacking generation of AICD.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	5	 APP and Fe65 also activated transcription in the presence of -secretase inhibitors that prevent amyloid -peptide production in human embryonic kidney 293 and SH-SY5Y cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In contrast to the transcriptionally active Notch intracellular domain, expression of AICD did not activate transcription.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	7	 An alternative mechanism for APP signal transduction is suggested by the identification of essential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites in Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Mutation of these Tip60 phosphorylation sites or treatment with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine blocked the ability of APP to signal through Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Moreover, APP stabilized Tip60 through CDK-dependent phosphorylation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Subcellular fractionation and confocal immunofluorescence showed that APP recruited Tip60 to membrane compartments.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Thus, APP may signal to the nucleus by a -secretase-independent mechanism that involves membrane sequestration and phosphorylation of Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The amyloid precursor protein (APP)2 has played a central role in Alzheimer disease research ever since pathogenic mutations were discovered within APP over a decade ago.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	13	 APP is a type 1 transmembrane protein that resembles a cell-surface receptor (1).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Studies on APP biology have focused primarily on its proteolytic processing.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	15	 APP undergoes two separate proteolytic pathways that have been termed the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways (reviewed in Ref.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by -secretase, generating the C-terminal transmembrane fragment C83.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The amyloidogenic pathway involves cleavage by the -secretase BACE, generating the C-terminal fragment C99, which is then cleaved by -secretase to generate the amyloid -peptide (A) and the C50/APP intracellular domain (AICD) fragment.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This series of proteolytic events of ectodomain shedding followed by intramembrane cleavage is reminiscent of the processing of the Notch receptor following binding to its ligands (reviewed in Ref.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Both APP and Notch require the presenilins for -secretase cleavage within the membrane (4-7).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	20	The pathogenic autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilins lead to increased generation of the fibrillogenic peptide A42, which forms amyloid plaques, one of the hallmark pathogenic lesions of Alzheimer disease (reviewed in Refs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Moreover, A is neurotoxic both in vitro and in vivo (10, 11).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These observations have led to the amyloid hypothesis, which proposes that the accumulation of A in the brain causes neurodegeneration and the dementia of Alzheimer disease.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, despite the significant effort spent investigating the properties of APP, its biological function and the reason for its cleavage remain enigmatic.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	24	 There is evidence that APP plays a role in cell adhesion, axonal transport, neurite outgrowth, and, recently, signal transduction (12-18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	25	It has been suggested that APP may signal by a mechanism similar to that of the Notch receptor, in which the intracellular tail released by presenilin/-secretase translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This idea was supported by the observation that APP, together with the adaptor protein Fe65, could activate the transcriptional activity of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, presenilins may mediate the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a number of transmembrane proteins that release soluble intracellular domains that carry out signaling functions (reviewed in Refs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	28	The adaptor protein Fe65 contains three protein interaction domains: the WW domain, which binds proline-rich sequences, and two C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domains, which interact with Tip60 and APP, respectively (18, 21).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Fe65 and APP have been placed within a biological pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, as the respective mutants have similar pharyngeal pumping phenotypes (22).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Expression of Fe65 can lead to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of AICD, where it may induce apoptosis through Tip60 (23-25, 48).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In addition, Tip60 and its histone acetyltransferase activity have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and DNA repair (26-28).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, the mechanism underlying the ability of APP to regulate Tip60-mediated transcription has not been determined.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In this study, we provide evidence that, in contrast to Notch, APP is able to activate transcription through Tip60 independently of -secretase cleavage by recruiting Tip60 to the membrane, leading to Tip60 activation through cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This is followed by nuclear translocation of Tip60 and Fe65 and activation of transcription.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	135	 To determine whether APP could signal to the nucleus by a similar mechanism, we utilized embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in both presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (presenilin-1/2 knockout (PS-KO) cells).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	136	 These cells are deficient in -secretase cleavage of APP and do not secrete A (6).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	137	 To address the potential signaling function of APP, we used the Gal4-Tip60 fusion construct, previously shown to activate a Gal4-luciferase reporter upon cotransfection of both Fe65 and APP (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	138	 This is a more physiological system for measuring the signaling ability of APP compared with APP-Gal4 assays, as it does not rely on the fusion of an artificial DNA-binding domain to APP itself.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	139	 As reported previously (18), significant transactivation by Gal4-Tip60 occurred only upon coexpression of both Fe65 and APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	140	 APP signaling was reduced by 45% in PS-KO cells relative to wild-type ES cells and was rescued upon expression of presenilin-1 (PS1) (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	141	 A -secretase inhibitor reduced APP signaling in wild-type cells to a level comparable with that in PS-KO cells (data not shown).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	142	 PS-KO cells were resistant to the -secretase inhibitor, consistent with the lack of -secretase activity in these cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	143	 However, APP retained the ability to activate Tip60 in the absence of presenilins, suggesting that -secretase cleavage of APP is not required for activation of Tip60.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Expression of presenilin in the PS-KO cells rescued the ability of mNotchE to activate the HES1 reporter (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This shows that the lack of Notch signaling in presenilin-deficient cells is due solely to the lack of presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of mNotchE.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Further illustrating this point, a similar level of transactivation was obtained upon expression of soluble NICD in both wild-type and presenilin-deficient cells (Fig.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	170	 These results suggest that presenilin-deficient cells cannot carry out signaling that requires -secretase activity, yet these cells can support APP-mediated activation of Tip60.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	194	It has been suggested that APP may be able to carry out signal transduction through cleavage by caspases at a cleavage site within its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (31, 32).

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Moreover, we confirmed that transfected PS1 was functional, as it rescued the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments that was observed in the absence of -secretase cleavage of APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Similar results were observed in HEK-293 cells transfected with C50 or C50-Myc (data not shown).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These results suggest that neprilysin may not be a transcriptional target of C50/AICD.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	210	Complex Formation of Tip60, Fe65, and APP Having shown that holo-APP or the membrane-spanning C-terminal fragments rather than C50/AICD may mediate signaling, we investigated whether Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Tip60 co-immunoprecipitated holo-APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The presence of holo-APP suggests that Tip60 may form a complex with APP in a membrane compartment rather than in the nucleus as suggested previously (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Even with longer exposures, we were unable to detect significant levels of APP C-terminal fragments or AICD in the Tip60 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Coexpression of Fe65 along with Tip60 and APP increased complex formation between Tip60 and APP (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These results suggest that Tip60 forms a complex with holo-APP, presumably at the membrane, and support the hypothesis that APP may signal through a mechanism that involves membrane recruitment of Tip60 rather than nuclear translocation of AICD.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	221	  Role of Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) Phosphorylation of Tip60 in Signaling Because APP can activate Tip60 through a pathway that does not require -secretase cleavage of APP, we considered whether APP signaling involves the activation of kinase cascades.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Two CDK sites were recently identified in Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 (34).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	223	 To examine the role of these phosphorylation sites in APP-Tip60 signaling, we fused the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to a Tip60 mutant in which serines 86 and 90 were converted to alanines.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	224	 We then assessed the activity of the Tip60 mutant in luciferase reporter assays of transfected HEK-293 cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The Tip60 mutant could not be activated by coexpression of Fe65 and APP, in contrast to the strong transactivation observed with wild-type Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	226	 To further confirm the requirement of CDK phosphorylation of Tip60 in APP signal transduction, we tested the CDK inhibitor roscovitine.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	227	 CDK inhibition with roscovitine significantly decreased the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	228	 Similar results were observed in the ES cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Thus, phosphorylation of Tip60 at serines 86 and 90 by CDKs contributes to transcriptional signaling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The Tip60 phosphorylation mutant was able to co-immunoprecipitate APP as efficiently as wild-type Tip60 when coexpressed with Fe65 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Thus, the inability of APP to activate the Tip60 mutant is unlikely to be due to an effect on complex formation between APP and Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	232	Stabilization of Phosphorylated Forms of Tip60 by APP and Fe65 We then determined whether APP facilitates Tip60 phosphorylation.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Treatment of the cell lysates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase led to a condensation of the multiple Tip60 bands into a single faster migrating form, suggesting that the slower migrating forms are phosphorylated forms of Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The Tip60 mutant migrated at a lower apparent molecular mass compared with wild-type Tip60, consistent with lack of phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	236	 Alkaline phosphatase treatment also led to the condensation of the Tip60 mutant bands into a single faster migrating form that comigrated with dephosphorylated wild-type Tip60, indicating that there are additional phosphorylation sites yet to be identified.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Coexpression of Tip60 with Fe65 and APP led to markedly enhanced levels of the slowest migrating phosphorylated forms of wild-type Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Densitometric analysis of the blot showed an 73% increase in the slowest migrating band relative to the fastest migrating form of Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Fe65 and APP did not affect the Tip60 CDK phosphorylation mutant, suggesting that they act to specifically increase phosphorylation at the CDK sites.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	240	 Coexpression of APP and Fe65 also led to significant phosphorylation of Tip60 at the CDK sites in ES cells (Fig.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	251	 A substantial portion of Tip60 was present in the nuclear fraction whether or not Fe65 and APP were coexpressed (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	252	 5A), as expected based on previous studies (18).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	253	 However, upon expression of Fe65 and APP, there was a marked redistribution of Tip60 to the membrane fraction (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	254	 The nuclear protein lamin B2 was present in the nuclear fraction, but was not detectable in the membrane fraction, suggesting that membrane-associated Tip60 is not due to nuclear contamination.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We then determined whether endogenous Tip60 can be recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	256	 For this purpose, we utilized control HEK-293 cells and HEK-293 cells stably expressing APPwt.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	257	 As observed with overexpressed Tip60, most of the endogenous Tip60 immunoreactivity was in the nuclear fraction in both the control and APP-expressing cells (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	258	 However, in APP-expressing cells, there was substantial Tip60 immunoreactivity in the membrane fraction that was not observed in the control cells.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	259	 The APPwt-expressing cells showed an 10-fold increase in membrane-associated Tip60 compared with control cells that did not overexpress APP and an 2-fold increase in total cellular Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	260	 Thus, endogenous Tip60 can be recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	261	 Once again, the lack of lamin B2 signal in the membrane fractions suggests that Tip60 immunoreactivity in the membrane fraction is not due to nuclear contamination.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	262	We then determined whether APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane in vivo by performing subcellular fractionation of wild-type and APP transgenic mouse brains.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Tip60 levels were compared in membrane fractions from the cortices and hippocampi of wild-type and Tg2576 APP transgenic mice that were either 3 months old (prior to plaque formation) or 2 years old (when the amyloid plaque load is high).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	264	 Significantly more Tip60 appeared in the membrane fractions of all APP transgenic samples compared with age-matched wild-type control samples (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	265	 However, Tip60 was also detected in the membrane fractions of wild-type mice, particularly in the hippocampus, suggesting that membrane sequestration occurs under physiological conditions.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The purity of these membrane fractions was once again confirmed by the absence of the nuclear protein lamin B2.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	267	 These results suggest that APP recruits Tip60 to membrane compartments, consistent with the formation of a Tip60 complex with the transmembrane form of APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	268	Colocalization of Tip60 and APP The effect of APP on Tip60 localization was also examined by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	270	 6, A-C) or with Fe65 and APP (D-F).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Tip60 was labeled with anti-HA antibody, and APP was labeled with antibody C8 (raised against the APP C-terminal domain).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	272	 The nucleus was visualized by staining with Hoechst dye.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	273	 When Tip60 was expressed alone, it localized to the nucleus, as shown by colocalization with the nuclear Hoechst dye (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	274	 Coexpression of Tip60 with Fe65 and APP led to a dramatic change in the localization of Tip60, with Tip60 now appearing outside of the nucleus (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Moreover, there was substantial colocalization of Tip60 and APP on the cell surface (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	276	 APP was excluded from the nucleus as expected (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The presence of non-transfected cells that were not labeled indicated the specificity of Tip60 and APP labeling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	278	 These results are consistent with the formation of a Tip60-Fe65-APP complex at the membrane and confirm the results of subcellular fractionation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	279	Shuttling of Tip60 between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm Our results suggest that APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane, which activates it through phosphorylation and complex formation with Fe65.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	280	 We investigated whether Tip60 contains nuclear localization and export sequences that could mediate Tip60 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The PSORTII program identified two potential nuclear localization sequences within Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These were the short basic nuclear localization sequence starting at amino acid 184 (PGRKRKS) and the type 1 bipartite nuclear localization sequence beginning at amino acid 295 (RKGTISFFEIDGRKNKS).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Both of these nuclear localization sequences are completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	284	 We also identified a potential nuclear export sequence (LTTLPVLYL) that conforms to the classic LX2-3(L/I/V/F/M)X2-3LX(L/I) motif, which is completely conserved in the mouse, rat, and human Tip60 proteins (35).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	285	 This raises the possibility that active transport of Tip60 out of the nucleus may be required for the interaction of Tip60 with APP, which may then be followed by nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	286	 To determine whether nuclear export is required for Tip60 activation, we used the CRM1 nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B in the Gal4-Tip60 luciferase assay.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Treatment with leptomycin B greatly suppressed the ability of APP to activate Tip60 (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Thus, nuclear export of Tip60 or some other factor is required for APP to be able to activate transcription through Tip60.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These results support a model in which Tip60 actively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, enabling its activation by APP and Fe65 at the membrane.

0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	296	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   These experiments indicate that APP can activate Tip60-mediated transcription in the absence of presenilin-mediated -secretase cleavage, contrary to current dogma.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	297	 This contrasts with Notch signaling, in which -secretase cleavage is required to activate the transcription of target genes.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	298	 These results were obtained in ES cells from PS-KO mice lacking detectable -secretase activity.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Additionally, we have shown that, in other cell lines, APP retained the ability to activate Tip60 in the presence of -secretase inhibitors at concentrations that prevent production of A and generation of the C50/AICD fragment.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Our findings suggest an alternative model of APP signaling in which holo-APP recruits Tip60 to the membrane to induce Tip60 phosphorylation and complex formation with Fe65, leading to activation of signal transduction (Fig.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	301	 This phosphorylation event appears to be carried out by a CDK, as signaling could be blocked by mutating the known CDK sites in Tip60 or by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	302	 A key aspect of this model is that the signaling role of APP may lie in its ability to recruit proteins to the microdomain of the membrane, where particular kinases, such as CDK5, are active.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	303	The model of APP signaling that we propose differs from that of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in that APP signals via activation of cytoplasmic proteins through post-translational modifications rather than by providing an intracellular domain to activate transcription.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	304	 This difference is critical, as both we and another group (36) found that the C50/AICD fragment is unable to activate transcription, in contrast to the transcriptional activity of NICD.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Moreover, our results indicate that overexpressed C50/AICD acts as a dominant-negative protein to inhibit APP-Tip60 signaling.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	306	 However, -secretase cleavage appears to facilitate signaling in ES cells, presumably through the release of the Fe65-Tip60 complex from the membrane.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	307	 One potential -secretase-independent mechanism for the dissociation of Fe65 and Tip60 from APP and the membrane could be phosphorylation of APP at threonine 668, which has been shown to decrease the interaction between Fe65 and APP (37).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Interestingly, CDK5 has been shown to phosphorylate APP at this site (38), raising the possibility that CDK5 could play the dual role of activating Tip60 and releasing the complex from the membrane.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	309	One difference between Notch and APP processing is that APP undergoes constitutive ectodomain shedding and -secretase cleavage, whereas Notch undergoes ectodomain shedding only following ligand binding.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	310	 Thus, it is difficult to understand how APP signaling could be regulated if it occurs constitutively.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Our findings indicate that one mechanism of regulation of this pathway is through the activity of CDKs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	312	 This is particularly intriguing, as altered activity of CDK5 has already been implicated in Alzheimer disease (39, 40).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Furthermore, the CDK5 activator p35 is membrane-associated, suggesting that CDK5 could specifically phosphorylate Tip60 when it is recruited to the membrane by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	314	A number of potential target genes of C50/AICD have been reported recently.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	315	 One intriguing potential target is the A-degrading enzyme neprilysin, which was reported to be responsive to C50/AICD in presenilin-deficient cells (33).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	316	 We did not observe reproducible regulation of neprilysin expression by PS1 or C50.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Moreover, we observed considerable variation in neprilysin levels between ES cell lines that did not strictly correlate with presenilin genotype.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	318	 We also attempted to verify two other proposed target genes of Tip60, KAI1 and manganese-super-oxide dismutase (27, 41).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	319	 In our hands, reporter constructs containing the promoters of these two genes were not responsive to Tip60, Fe65, APP, or various combinations of these constructs.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Another recent study suggested that a fusion of the protein citrine to C50/AICD increases the expression of a number of genes, including APP, BACE, Tip60, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and KAI1 (42).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	321	 We have been unable to confirm these results by transfection of HEK-293 cells with C50 or C50-Myc, which could reflect a different activity of the reported citrine fusion protein.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Overall, we have not been able to confirm any of the proposed C50/AICD target genes that we are aware of at this time.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Further work needs to be done to delineate the APP signaling pathway with primary importance being the identification of endogenous target genes that are affected by APP.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	324	 Progress in this area may have been hindered thus far by the focus on AICD as the transcriptionally active form.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	325	The relevance of APP signaling to Alzheimer disease is unclear.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	326	 However, it has been shown that many pathogenic mutations in presenilins actually decrease Notch signaling (4, 43-45).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Moreover, presenilin-deficient mice exhibit a neurodegenerative phenotype (46).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	328	 Additionally, a recent study showed that familial Alzheimer disease mutations in APP can inhibit signaling through the APP-Gal4-VP16 fusion (47).
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	329	 Thus, alterations in APP signaling could potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	330	Overall, our data provide evidence for APP signaling by a novel mechanism that does not require -secretase cleavage by the presenilins and that involves recruitment of signaling factors to the membrane to facilitate phosphorylation and complex formation.
0.36325452.16103124.html.plaintext.txt	331	 This mechanism would allow signaling to be regulated in multiple ways through the activity of CDKs, shuttling of Tip60 between the nucleus and cytoplasm, or possibly through -secretase activity, which may modulate activation even though it is not required.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	5	Presenilin (PS1 and PS2) holoproteins are transiently incorporated into low molecular weight (MW) complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	6	 During subsequent incorporation into a higher MW complex, they undergo endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Mutation of either of two conserved aspartate residues in transmembrane domains inhibits both presenilin-endoproteolysis and the proteolytic processing of -amyloid precursor protein and Notch.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We show that although PS1/PS2 endoproteolysis is not required for inclusion into the higher MW N- and C-terminal fragment-containing complex, aspartate mutant holoprotein presenilins are not incorporated into the high MW complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Aspartate mutant presenilin holoproteins also preclude entry of endogenous wild type PS1/PS2 into the high MW complexes but do not affect the incorporation of wild type holoproteins into lower MW holoprotein complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These data suggest that the loss of function effects of the aspartate mutants result in altered PS complex maturation and argue that the functional presenilin moieties are contained in the high molecular weight complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	11	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	12	Presenilin 1 (PS1)1 (1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) (2, 3) are homologous polytopic transmembrane proteins that are components of independent, high molecular weight, heteropolymeric protein complexes (4, 5).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Inclusion of presenilins into these complexes follows a tightly regulated pathway in which full-length presenilin holoprotein monomers are either incorporated into an immature (~180 kDa) complex in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (4, 5) or are degraded through a proteasome-dependent mechanism (6-8).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Maturation of these early complexes in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi is associated with an increase in apparent molecular mass (to ~250 kDa) (4, 5), and with an endoproteolytic cleavage of the presenilin holoprotein to render N- and C-terminal fragments (PS-NTF and PS-CTF, respectively) (9).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Because the stoichiometry and abundance of the PS-NTF and PS-CTF are tightly regulated even when driven by exogenous transgenes, it has been speculated that the limited abundance of another unknown component of the presenilin complexes restrains the amount of presenilin that can be stabilized in complexes (10).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	16	 As a result, when overexpressed, exogenous presenilins compete for this unknown limiting factor and displace endogenous presenilin moieties (10).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This schema is depicted in Fig.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	20	 PS holoprotein (full-length PS (fl-PS)), NTF and CTF, -catenin (-cat), and other uncharacterized proteins, one of which is a putative "unknown limiting factor" (ULF) present in both PS1 and PS2 complexes, are functional components of the presenilin complexes (27).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Overexpression of PS1 or PS2 has previously been shown to displace endogenous presenilin, presumably by competing for the putative unknown limiting factor.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Arrows depict the site of Notch cleavage and sites of - and -secretase cleavages of APP; shaded boxes represent the liberated products derived from these cleavages.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	23	The presenilins play a role in proteolytic cleavage within the transmembrane domains of other proteins such as Notch (11-14), -amyloid precursor protein (APP) (15-20), and endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor/endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane kinase (Ire1p) (21, 22).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The precise role of PS1 in this unusual form of proteolytic processing is unknown.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Mutating either of the two conserved aspartate residues within transmembrane domains of PS1 (Asp257 and Asp385) or PS2 (Asp366) inhibits the endoproteolytic cleavage of the mutant presenilin and reduces the intramembranous cleavage of APP and Notch (23-25).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	26	 It has been proposed that mutation of these aspartate residues has a dominant negative effect on a catalytic site and that the presenilins are aspartyl proteases (23).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	27	 One observation possibly inconsistent with this hypothesis is that whereas PS1/, PS1 aspartate mutant, and PS2 aspartate mutant cells all have impaired -secretase activity, PS2/ cells have normal -secretase activity (24, 26).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Consequently, PS aspartate mutations were investigated for their effects on the formation of presenilin complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	29	We used glycerol velocity fractionation to determine whether mutation of these aspartate residues affected the native state of the presenilins.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	30	 We show that these mutations preclude inclusion of the aspartate mutant presenilins into higher molecular weight complexes, an effect that is independent of presenilin endoproteolysis.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We also show that overexpression of aspartate mutant presenilins displaces endogenous PS1 and PS2 from the high MW PSI-NTF- and -CTF-containing complexes but does not alter their incorporation into the lower MW holoprotein-containing precursor complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Taken together, these structural effects on presenilin complex formation explain all previous observations without the need to postulate a novel catalytic activity for these residues.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These results also argue that the low MW holoprotein complexes, regardless of whether they have wild type PS1/PS2 or aspartate mutant PS1/PS2, are nonfunctional intermediaries between PS monomers and PS-NTF CTF-containing higher MW functional complexes.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We elected to investigate the Asp  Ala mutants because the change in both the size and charge of the amino acid would maximize our ability to detect structural effects, which we would predict to be subtle because the aspartate mutant PS1 molecules are not destabilized and degraded.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	50	Initial characterization of our cell lines overexpressing wild type human PS1 (PS1wt), wild type PS2 (PS2wt), aspartate mutant PS1 (PS1D257A and PS1D385A), or aspartate mutant PS2D366A confirmed previous reports of the effects of overexpression of aspartate mutant PS1/PS2 proteins (23, 24).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Thus, overexpression of human PS1D257A or human PS1D385A in MEF lines resulted in the expected "displacement/replacement" of the endogenous mouse PS1, inhibition of the endoproteolysis of the aspartate mutant human PS1, and inhibition of -secretase cleavage of endogenous mouse APP to levels comparable to those in fibroblasts from homozygous PS1-null (PS1/) mice (Fig.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, note that the human specific PS1 antibody NT1 (29) did detect small amounts of the PS1D257A and PS1D385A proteins as processed fragments (Fig.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The aspartate mutant presenilins might be excluded from the mature, larger complexes (e.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Alternatively, it could be argued that it is their failure to undergo endoproteolysis, which inhibits their inclusion in the mature fragment containing complex.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	110	Finally, to address the question of how aspartate mutants (and especially PS2 aspartate mutants) might suppress normal -secretase activity, we examined endogenous PS1 levels in cells overexpressing the PS2D366A mutation (Fig.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	112	 In agreement with prior studies on overexpression of wild type presenilins (10), these experiments showed that overexpression of either wild type or aspartate mutant PS2 displaced and destabilized endogenous PS1 and vice versa.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	113	 However, the displacement phenomenon induced by overexpression of either wild type or aspartate mutant presenilin proteins mainly affects the formation of NTF CTF fragment complexes.

0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	138	Two lines of evidence from our data support the notion that mutation of conserved intramembrane aspartate residues of either PS1 or PS2 has structural effects on the normal presenilin protein complex formation.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	139	 First, these mutations are associated with failed maturation of aspartate mutant presenilin protein complexes such that the majority of aspartate mutant presenilins remain in the smaller (immature) holoprotein-containing complex.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	140	 This failure of aspartate mutant PS complexes to mature into the higher molecular weight forms cannot be ascribed simply to failure of presenilin endoproteolysis.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Even when the PS1D385A mutant is placed within the PS1E10 protein, which does not require endoproteolysis for biological activity, the chimeric PS1E10  D385A protein does not mature and has impaired activity.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that the aspartate residues are important in the formation of intra- or intermolecular interactions in the mature presenilin complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	143	 For instance, the aspartate residues might be involved in the interaction of presenilins with as yet unidentified membrane-bound proteins specific to the higher molecular weight mature complex.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	144	The second line of evidence, which supports a structural effect of these mutations, is our observation that a minor proportion of the aspartate mutant proteins are dispersed into fractions of much higher MW than the fractions containing the physiological wild type high MW presenilin complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The presence of trace amounts of the aspartate mutant presenilins in very high molecular weight fractions might reflect either altered interactions within the lipid bilayer (causing altered apparent buoyancy in the glycerol gradient) or more probably the retention and/or recruitment of additional proteins that are not normal components of the mature high molecular weight PSwt complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	146	Whereas inhibition of physiological complex formation would by itself be sufficient to explain the loss of function effects of these mutations, our observations also suggest a secondary effect that provides a simple and robust explanation for the disparity between the functional consequences of PS2/ and PS2D366A mutations.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Overexpression of aspartate mutant PS2 massively suppresses formation of the endogenous PS1 fragment-containing complex, presumably therefore leaving cells expressing the PS2D366A mutation with no functional PS1 or PS2 activity.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Although it is difficult to precisely compare expression levels of aspartate mutant presenilins (which are detectable mainly as holoproteins) with those of wild-type presenilins (which generate both holoprotein and NTF CTF), it also seems that aspartate mutant presenilins might be more efficient at displacing endogenous presenilins than are wild type presenilins.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	149	The final implication of our results is that the functional presenilin moiety is most likely to be the higher molecular weight NTF CTF-containing complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This is derived from the observation that overexpression of aspartate mutant presenilins massively suppresses formation of the endogenous presenilin higher MW NTF CTF-containing complexes but does not affect the formation or abundance of endogenous lower molecular weight holoprotein complexes.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Because cells expressing aspartate mutant presenilins have reduced presenilin biological activities, this argues that the endogenous holoprotein complexes (whose abundance and size are unaltered) are not the biologically active complex.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The alternate possibility (that aspartate mutant PS2 is forming nonfunctional hetero-oligomers with endogenous PS1) can be dismissed, because PS1 and PS2 form independent complexes and cannot be co-immunoprecipitated even when co-expressed in the same cell (4, 5, 10, 34).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Finally, because this "displacement" event occurs after the formation of stable holoprotein complexes, it implies that there is likely to be a low abundance or labile intermediary complex (which cannot be resolved on the glycerol velocity gradients) prior to the formation of the stable high MW functional complex (see Fig.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We hypothesize that the aspartate mutant proteins reach this intermediary, displace the endogenous presenilins, but are then unable to proceed further (see Fig.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The hypothesis that the functionally active form of the presenilins is in higher MW complexes is in agreement with the discovery that PS1 NTF CTF (but not PS1 holoproteins) and -secretase co-elute on size exclusion chromatography in high molecular weight fractions (35).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	156	Defective maturation of the aspartate mutant presenilins together with efficient displacement of endogenous presenilins by aspartate mutant PS1/PS2 holoproteins, fully explain both the absence of biological activity of the aspartate mutant presenilins and their apparent dominant negative effect on endogenous wild type proteins.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Our results thus provide a complete explanation for the previously discordant observation that cells overexpressing PS2 aspartate mutant have impaired -secretase, whereas -secretase activity is normal in PS2/ cells (24, 26).
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In contrast, it is less obvious how loss of a catalytic site would block presenilin complex maturation or why it would cause more efficient displacement effects.
0.40102017.10856299.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Further biochemical dissection of the presenilin complexes and especially the higher molecular weight NTF CTF-containing complexes will likely identify proteins that are directly involved in the processing of APP, Notch, and endoplasmic reticulum-stress sensor/endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane kinase.

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	4	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   In recent years, important progress has been made in uncovering genes implicated in Alzheimer s disease (AD).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Three causal genes have been identified in which mutations cause familial presenile AD: the amyloid precursor protein gene and the presenilin 1 and 2 genes.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Additionally, the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene was shown to be a major risk factor for AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Despite the genetic heterogeneity, all of these genes work through a common mechanism, i.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	8	 increasing the amount and deposition of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) in brain triggering AD-related neuronal degeneration.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, the levels of Ass and of the factors involved in its production and deposition are important in the neuropathogenesis of AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Regulation of transcription of AD genes might therefore be an important player in the neurodegenerative process.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	11	 In this review, we describe the major features of transcriptional regulation of the known AD genes and the implications of variable expression levels on susceptibility to AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	13	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the brain characterized by neuronal loss, extensive deposition of amyloid ss peptide (Ass) in the brain parenchyma and in vessel walls, and the appearance of neuronal inclusions of abnormally phosphorylated tau.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The regions that are most affected are the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Clinically, AD patients show a gradually progressive decline in memory and cognitive functions that is diagnosed on neurological examination, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Among the dementias, AD is the most frequent, with 70% of cases affected.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The prevalence of AD increases with age, with 40% of the population older than 85 years affected (1).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Apart from aging per se, two other well defined risk factors are gender and family history of AD (2).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The genetic etiology of AD is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors influencing the expression of the phenotype.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Nevertheless, in a small percentage ( < 1%) of AD cases the disease is inherited as a fully penetrant monogenic trait in an autosomal dominant manner.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In all these cases, the disease onset is before the age of 65 years, i.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	22	 presenile AD or early-onset AD (EOAD).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These monogenic AD families have been instrumental in the identification of AD genes using the positional cloning approach.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	24	 At least four genetic loci that confer inherited susceptibility have been identified to date.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Characteristics of these genes are summarized in Table 1.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The first causative gene identified for EOAD is the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) (3) on chromosome 21q21.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	27	2 (4), encoding a single membrane-spanning protein (5 to 9).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Full-length APP is metabolized rapidly by two major pathways in all cells.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In many cells, the most prominent pathway is the constitutive pathway where -secretase cleaves the Ass sequence (10), producing N-truncated Ass peptides.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Neurons, however, have an intrinsic tendency to metabolize APP along the amyloidogenic pathway (11 to 13), in which sequential cleavage by ss- and -secretases releases full-length Ass peptides.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Whereas ss-secretase cleaves highly specifically, -secretase cleaves less specifically, leading to either a 40 amino acid peptide (Ass40) or a 42 amino acid isoform (Ass42) (14,15).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	32	 All eight AD-related APP mutations detected to date are located near the secretase cleavage sites and have been demonstrated to interfere with APP processing, leading to increased secretion of Ass42.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This Ass42 peptide has been shown, at least in vitro, to aggregate more rapidly into fibrils (16) and was claimed to be the earliest and most abundant Ass peptide in amyloid deposits (17 to 19).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Recent theories propose that Ass deposits or partially aggregated soluble Ass trigger a neurotoxic cascade, thereby causing neurodegeneration and AD (20,21).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	35	 As a result, Ass and, in particular, Ass42 were assigned a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	36	 AD genes   The most frequently mutated EOAD gene is presenilin 1 (PSEN1), located on chromosome 14q24.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Based on homology studies, the third causal EOAD gene, presenilin 2 (PSEN2), was isolated and mapped to chromosome 1q42.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The PSEN genes encode highly homologous integral membrane proteins with eight putative transmembrane domains (27 to 30).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To date,  > 60 PSEN1 and 4 PSEN2 mutations have been identified in EOAD patients, scattered over the entire coding region of the genes (http://molgen-www.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Both in vitro and in vivo, PSEN mutations lead to increased Ass42 production, suggesting a role for PSEN in the processing of APP (31 to 45).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Together, these findings led to the hypothesis of a gain of function for mutant PSEN (20) and provided further evidence for the central role of Ass42 in AD pathogenesis.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	42	 PSENs have also been shown to be death substrates undergoing caspase cleavage during apoptosis (46 to 48).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Although the role of apoptosis in neuronal cell death in AD remains to be proven, AD-linked PSEN mutations, as well as decreased expression of PSEN1 and overexpression of PSEN2 (46), result in apoptosis (49).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, the homology with SEL-12 of Caenorhabditis elegans suggested a possible role for PSEN in NOTCH signaling (50).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Further evidence was provided by the study of embryonically lethal PSEN1-deficient mice, which show abnormal somite segmentation, a phenotype shared with NOTCH1-deficient mice (51,52).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Moreover, mutations in other genes involved in NOTCH signaling also lead to central nervous system (CNS) disorders with onset ages in adulthood (53).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	47	In addition to the three causative genes, the 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on chromosome 19 was identified as a genetic risk factor for both EOAD (54,55) and late-onset AD (LOAD) (56 to 58).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The risk associated with the 4 allele is dose dependent, which is reflected in the increased risk and decreased onset age with the number of 4 alleles (59).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Several observations indicated that APOE 4 is also involved in increased Ass deposition.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	50	 It was shown that APOE promotes Ass fibril formation in vitro (60).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Also, APOE 4 has a higher binding affinity for Ass than has APOE 3 (56,61), possibly making Ass insoluble and therefore more prone to deposition.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Although these in vitro data are controversial, AD patients homozygous for APOE 4 have indeed been shown to have more Ass deposits than APOE 3 homozygotes (62).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Also, it was shown that APOE 4 influences the onset age of EOAD patients carrying an AD-related APP mutation but not that of PSEN1 mutation carriers (63).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	54	Since mutations in the causal EOAD genes explain  < 1% and APOE 4  < 20% of all AD cases (22,64,65), it is clear that other genetic factors are involved in AD pathogenesis.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Variation in the regulatory regions of APP (66,67), PSEN1 (22,68,69) and APOE (70 to 73) have been suggested to contribute to susceptibility to AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In this review, we will discuss the importance of expression levels of known AD genes and the implications of variations in their regulatory regions for susceptibility to AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	57	   GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	58	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   APP is expressed in a variety of tissues, with the highest expression in neuronal cells of the CNS (6,74 to 77).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	59	 APP expression can be induced by a variety of agents such as growth hormones and cytokines (9,11,78 to 86) and by stress conditions (87 to 89).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Up-regulation (90,91) of APP promoter activity corroborates with mRNA expression studies (82,92), suggesting a major role for the APP promoter in specific APP expression.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	61	The control mechanisms of APP gene expression have been subject to extensive studies.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The APP promoter contains numerous putative binding sites for regulatory transcription factors (Table 2) (93 to 97).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, deletion mapping of the APP promoter demonstrated that  < 100 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) are sufficient for high levels of expression in numerous cell types (98 to 100).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	64	 This proximal promoter region is devoid of a functional TATA box, and transcription initiation is regulated by a strong initiator element (Inr) surrounding the major TSS +1 (Fig.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Mutations within and immediately upstream of Inr lead to altered use of multiple TSSs and reduce transcriptional activity.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Both Inr and the upstream element (UE) are associated with DNase I-protected domains, suggesting sequence-specific binding of nuclear factors (101).

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	77	  APP promoter activation is covered mainly by two GC-rich elements (Table 2, Fig.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The  to 93/ to 82 fragment (APBss) contributes at least 70% to APP promoter activity in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and was shown to bind the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a known regulator of c-myc expression implicated in the promotion of apoptosis (Table 2, Fig.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The remaining APP promoter activity is accounted for mainly by the  to 65/ to 41 fragment (APB) and is mediated by binding of stimulating protein 1 (SP1) and the upstream stimulatory factor (USF), member of the c-Myc-related family of DNA-binding proteins (99,104 to 106).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Recently, an interaction model for APP transcriptional activity based on DNA looping was presented.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In this model, a novel SP1-like protein forms a homodimer tethering the USF and 5'-flanking SP1 sites, and the upstream AP-1 site with flanking GC-rich motif (Fig.

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	85	  Transcriptional activation of APP can also be mediated by heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) binding to the heat shock element (HSE) at position  to 317 (Table 2, Fig.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	86	 HSF-1 activation is induced by numerous stress factors, including hypoxia, decreased pH, elevated Ca2+, decreased ATP and exposure to reactive species.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	87	 It was also reported recently that members of the NF-B/Rel family can specifically recognize two identical sequences at  to 1837/ to 1822 and  to 2250/ to 2241, in the distal promoter region of APP, referred to as APPB sites (108).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These sites were shown to interact specifically with a complex containing the p50 subunit of the NF-B family that is constitutively expressed in neurons and acts as a positive regulator of gene expression in cells of neuronal origin (109).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The distal APP promoter also harbors at least one negative regulator of transcription, the upstream regulatory element (URE) between  to 2257 and  to 2234, binding an unknown transcription factor (TF), expressed in a restricted number of cell types and different regions of the human brain (110,111).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	90	Not only are the structure and expression pattern of APP highly conserved between species (112,113), but the promoter regions of rodents and primates are also highly homologous to that of the human APP (80%) (93,94,114).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	91	 They all have a high GC content, lack typical TATA and CAAT boxes and share nearly all of the above-described TF-binding sites (Table 2), suggesting a major role for these TFs in APP regulation in vivo (93,94,99,114).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	92	Like APP, the PSENs are ubiquitously expressed, although they display markedly tissue-specific transcriptional differences.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In brain, both PSEN1 transcripts of 2.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	94	5 kb are present at relatively high levels, whereas only one PSEN2 transcript (2.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	95	3 kb) can be detected at relatively low levels (24,26, 115,116).

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In neuronal cells, the PSEN1 promoter binds an Ets-1/2 protein.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Both Ets-1 and Ets-2 are widely expressed in different tissues but are differentially regulated (132,133).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Ets-2 is present at high levels in adult brain, including post-mitotic neurons.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Ets-1 is particularly abundant in the CNS during specific developmental stages (133).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Another Ets family member, Elk-1, has also been shown to be expressed in brain where it is localized exclusively to neurons (134).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Which members of the Ets family are able to activate PSEN1 transcription in vivo is not clear.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Sequences (+107 to +178) downstream from the TSS also contain major cis-elements, controlling 80% of total PSEN1 promoter activity.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Collectively, these data indicate that sequences upstream and downstream of the TSS each control  > 80% of promoter activity, indicating the importance of protein to protein interactions between TFs binding to upstream and downstream cis-elements.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	112	Preliminary data on murine PSEN1 promoter activity and in situ hybridization suggest that PSEN1 is expressed and transcribed preferentially in neurons.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The structure and expression of PSEN1 are highly conserved between mice and human.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Multiple mRNA transcripts, originating from TSSs of alternatively transcribed first exons, have been reported for both species.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Reporter gene analysis showed that both TSSs are most probably controlled by one single promoter spanning the +1 position of exon 1A (130).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	116	 In human, only one exon 1B transcript has been reported so far; therefore, it is difficult to conceive how exon 1B transcription can be driven from the same promoter as the abundant exon 1A transcripts, as described for the mouse transcripts.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Hence, it is possible that transcription from the human exon 1B is controlled by its own promoter or at least by exon 1B-specific cis-elements, possibly located downstream of +178.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Until now, no data on functional cis-elements controlling transcription from human PSEN1 exon 1B have been reported.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	119	In the regulatory region, maximal similarity is found in the  to 39/+117 sequence of the mouse PSEN1 promoter region.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	120	 The +20 GC box (SP1) and the  to 12 Ets motif are strictly conserved, and reporter gene analysis indicated that this region contributes to the neuron-preferred promoter activity (130).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The mouse sequence upstream of position  to 39 differs significantly from the human sequences.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Absence of long stretches of sequence homology is one of the main problems in promoter recognition and it is conceivable that more functional cis-elements, although not located at the corresponding positions, are shared between the mouse and human PSEN1 promoter.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Furthermore, sequences from  to 22 to +178, which confer  > 80% of human PSEN1 promoter activity, coincide with the region of high homology with the mouse promoter.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Also, the major human +1 TSS is located only eight nucleotides downstream of the mouse TSS (130,131), emphasizing the importance of this region for the function of the promoter in both species.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	125	Despite the striking similarities between PSEN2 and PSEN1 in genomic structure, alternative transcripts and use of multiple TSSs (116,135,136), there is little homology in the 5'-flanking region, and the first two exons of PSEN2, although alternatively transcribed, are not mutually exclusive (116).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	126	 There are two distinct cis-elements regulating transcription from the predicted TSS.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	127	 PSEN2 basal promoter activity resides between  to 403 and +13, a TATA-less, GC-rich region containing numerous putative AP-2 and SP1 sites (137).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In this region, a functional nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive element that mediates PSEN2 promoter activation following NGF treatment also resides.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	129	 The observed 2-fold up-regulation by NGF confirmed the predicted involvement of PSENs in neuronal differentiation (138).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Whether the AP-2 or SP1 sites clustered in this region or another as yet unidentified cis-element is responsible for the NGF responsiveness is not yet clear.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Further deletion analysis provided evidence for the existence of a second PSEN2 promoter located in intron 1, directing transcription from the start sites in exon 2, though no functional elements have been identified so far.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	132	APOE is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types and its expression is highly regulated by nutritional, hormonal, tissue- and cell-specific factors, and intracellular cholesterol levels (139,140).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In contrast to the causal AD genes, the 5'-flanking sequence of APOE harbors a functional TATA box (141).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Multiple general and specific cis-elements have been mapped to the APOE promoter (Table 2, Fig.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The proximal GC box binds SP1 and is required for maximum transcriptional activity (142).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Three non-specific enhancer elements, active in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (143), were identified.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Two of these, upstream regulatory elements 1 (URE1) and 2 (URE2), reside in the proximal promoter region and one resides in the first intron, the intron regulatory element 1 (IRE1).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The dominant regulatory sequence in URE1 is located from  to 161 to  to 141 and is termed the positive element for transcription (PET).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This fragment binds at least two TFs, one of which is SP1.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Although SP1 is the only protein required for enhancer activity of PET, a second as yet unknown protein competes with SP1, in this way possibly negatively regulating APOE expression (142).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	141	 A fourth regulatory domain in the APOE promoter, URE3, binds the 300 kDa URE3-binding protein, but needs further characterization (144).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	142	In astrocytic cells, the activity of the proximal promoter of APOE is up-regulated synergistically by cAMP and retinoic acid (RA), which is mediated by two AP-2 sites located in the proximal promoter (145).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	143	 cAMP mimics the changes occurring in reactive gliosis (146,147) and RA is a potent morphogenetic agent on the developing nervous system and a known regulator of AP-2 expression (148).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	144	 It is therefore reasonable to presume that the observed synergistic effect of cAMP and RA on the APOE promoter is probably due to an RA-promoted increase in AP-2, followed by a post-transcriptional activation of AP-2 mediated by cAMP (148,149).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	145	 More tissue-specific cis-elements identified at present seem to reside downstream of APOE, with a potential brain-specific transcriptional activator in the APOE to APOCI intergenic region (150 to 154).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	146	The 5' upstream region of rodent APOE is homologous to human APOE up to 200 bp upstream of the TSS (155,156), with the TATA box, the proximal GC box and URE3 at corresponding positions (Table 2) (141,156,157).

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, a CG transversion was detected at position  to 209 in both affected and unaffected subjects (Table 3) (161).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Although this variation is not unique for AD, it may have an effect on APP transcriptional activity associated with AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Since the number of patients and controls was small and the individual analyses covered only parts of the APP promoter, one cannot yet exclude the existence of AD-related variations in the APP promoter altering transcriptional activity.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Recent sib-pair analyses suggested that genetic variability at the APP locus may contribute to risk for LOAD (66,67).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It is obvious that a systematic screening of the APP regulatory sequences in extended AD populations is necessary.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Promoter variations in AD genes   Besides the amount of full-length APP available, the amount and activity of APP processing factors also influence the production of the amyloidogenic Ass42.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Since PSENs were assigned a pivotal role in APP processing, altered PSEN expression due to variations in regulatory regions is considered a risk factor for AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Genetic association studies in a population-based EOAD case to control sample showed association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  to 48CT with EOAD (Table 3) (68).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Systematic screening of 3 kb of the PSEN1 upstream region in the same population revealed, in addition to  to 48C/T (22), four novel polymorphisms ( to 1789G/A,  to 2154G/A,  to 2319Tn and  to 2823I/D), two of which ( to 2154G/A and  to 2823I/D) were also shown to be associated with increased risk for EOAD (Table 3).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Linkage disequilibrium allowed for the identification of an EOAD risk haplotype ( to 48C/ to 2154G/ to 2823D).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Additionally, two potentially AD-related mutations ( to 280CG and  to 2818AG) were identified (Table 3) (69).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The effect of  to 280CG and  to 48CT on the transcriptional activity of PSEN1 was studied in a transient transfection system.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Luciferase reporter gene analysis demonstrated a neuron-specific 30% decrease in promoter activity for the  to 280G mutant and a neuron-specific 50% decrease in promoter activity for the  to 48C risk allele, which in homozygous individuals can lead to a critical decrease in PSEN1 expression.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Notably, the genetic association of  to 48C with EOAD was explained by an over-representation of the CC genotype in EOAD patients.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These studies provide evidence that increased risk for EOAD associated with PSEN1 may result from genetic variations in the regulatory region leading to altered expression levels of PSEN1 in neuronal cells due to differential binding of nuclear proteins (69,162,163).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	164	 These data suggest that the increased risk for EOAD associated with PSEN1 may result from decreased expression levels of the PSEN1 protein.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	165	Although PSEN2 has also been shown to be involved in APP processing, and changes in its expression levels might be important in AD pathology, no association was found with AD and no PSEN2 promoter variations have been reported to date.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	166	It was shown that the relative APOE 4 mRNA level is increased in AD compared with controls, and it was suggested that genetic variability in the neuronal expression of APOE contributes to disease risk (70).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Multiple studies suggested that genetic variability in the regulatory region of APOE may modulate the risk associated with the APOE 4 isoform.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The first variation detected in the APOE regulatory region was a CG transversion at position +113 in the intron 1 enhancer element (IE1), although no statistically significant association independent of APOE 4 could be detected (Table 3) (164).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In a population-based study, three SNPs ( to 491AT,  to 427TC and  to 219TG alias Th1E47cs) and two heterozygous mutations ( to 557CT and  to 456CT) were identified (Table 3) (71,73).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Reporter gene analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the three SNPs alter transcriptional activity of the APOE promoter due to differential binding of TFs (71,72).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	171	 For all three SNPs, genetic association with AD, independent of APOE 4, was reported (71 to 73).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Although several studies attempted to confirm this association, most reported either absence of association or association due to linkage disequilibrium with APOE 4 (114,165 to 172).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, population-based differences of APOE 4 frequencies, giving rise to differences in relative risk for AD, have been documented previously (173,174).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	174	 It is therefore conceivable that there is a wide variation in relative risk for AD associated with APOE promoter polymorphisms.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	175	In vivo studies demonstrated that the deleterious effect on disease risk of both the  to 219T and  to 491A risk alleles correlated with an increased expression of the 4 allele in brain (175).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Later it was shown that the  to 491AA risk genotype is associated with increased levels of APOE in plasma, independently of APOE 4 or AD status, though more pronounced in AD patients (176).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	177	 These data provide evidence that, in addition to the qualitative effect of the APOE 2/3/4 isoforms on risk for AD, the quantitative variation of expression of these isoforms due to functional APOE promoter variations is a key determinant in AD development.

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	179	 CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The most favored hypothesis suggests a pivotal role for increased Ass42 secretion in AD pathology.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Since the amount of APP and of factors involved in its processing are crucial for this elevation, it is conceivable that the transcriptional regulation of their genes plays an important role in AD pathology.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A number of studies indicate that the amount of APP mRNA is indeed increased in AD brains (177 to 181).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Moreover, trisomy 21 in Down syndrome (DS) patients leads to a 4- to 5-fold overexpression of APP, resulting in a 50 year decrease in onset age of AD in DS patients compared with the normal population (182).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results imply that a fundamental component of the molecular etiology of AD may lie in the expression of APP, its biogenesis and turnover, since the induction of the pathway leading to Ass production will depend on the amount of APP present.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	184	Since overlapping cis-elements are known to be important for differential gene expression (183 to 185), the presence of overlapping SP1- and USF-binding sites in the APP promoter suggests that two different and independent regulatory pathways for APP expression might exist, one mediated by SP1 and the other by USF (104).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	185	 SP1 has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed, however, with a substantial variation in different cell types and during development (186).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The low levels of SP1 detected in different brain regions suggest that USF might also contribute substantially to the high expression of APP in neuronal cells, which was confirmed by EMSA with nuclear extracts from rat brain showing binding to USF but not to SP1.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	187	 A number of factors have been reported that are able to influence SP1 activity in certain cell types, in this way leading to preferred usage of one pathway (187,188).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Therefore, a deregulated overexpression of APP in brain might simply be caused by a local increase in SP1 activity.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	189	Additionally, AD brains exhibit numerous features which indicate that neurons affected by AD exist under conditions of stress.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Since APP expression is regulated by stress factors, one can speculate that APP may be one of the genes coordinately modulated in brain in response to situations that require a defensive reaction.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Stress-induced overexpression of APP can then lead to increased Ass production.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	192	 It is therefore conceivable that an imbalance between different regulatory pathways for APP expression, caused by a variation in a functional cis-element or by altered expression levels of TFs in specific brain regions, might be a risk factor for AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	193	During aging, the expression of PSENs decreases (120), and an even more significant decrease in PSEN has been reported in neurons from brain areas adversely affected by AD (189,190).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast, astrocytes reacting to neurodegeneration express elevated levels of PSEN (189,191).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Several lines of evidence indicate that PSEN1 is closely linked to the -secretase processing of APP and that decreased expression ( < 50%) and mutations in PSEN1 lead to increased secretion of Ass42 (20,192).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Small changes in PSEN expression levels can have major implications for APP processing and AD pathology.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	197	Additionally, PSENs were shown to be death substrates undergoing caspase cleavage during apoptosis (46 to 48,193).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Although the role of apoptosis in neuronal cell death in AD remains to be proven, it is interesting that PSEN2 overexpression and AD-linked mutations in both PSENs can shift conventional PSEN cleavage towards caspase cleavage (46), whereas a reduction of PSEN1 results in apoptosis (49).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Regardless of the hypothesis on AD pathology, it is clear that expression of both PSENs is highly regulated and that mutations or variations leading to altered expression can easily be imagined to have major effects on PSEN functioning.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	200	APOE was suggested to be involved in the repair process following nerve injury.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	201	 It was shown that APOE has an effect on neurite morphogenesis of cultured neurons, where APOE 3 reduces the amount of neurite branching and promotes neurite extension, whereas APOE 4 does not (194,195).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In brain, APOE synthesis takes place in astrocytes (196,197) and is increased dramatically after nerve injury (198 to 200).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	203	 The reactive gliosis in AD brains involves a series of morphological and biochemical changes in activated astrocytes (201), including up-regulation of APOE mRNA levels which is mediated by AP-2 (202).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Further determination of the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of APOE synthesis in brain is a matter of greatest importance, considering the possible roles of this protein in processes of repair in the pathogenesis of AD (56,59).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Here, special attention needs to be drawn to mechanisms of differential expression of the different APOE isoforms.

0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	216	It is well documented that single nucleotide changes in a promoter region may affect transcriptional activity mediated by TFs (203,204), either by directly altering a TF-binding site or by changing the structure of DNA, thereby affecting the access of TFs.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Multiple studies provided evidence that altered expression levels of APP, PSENs and the different isoforms of APOE are involved in AD pathology, suggesting a role for transcriptional regulation in the disease process.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Variations in functional regulatory elements can therefore be considered risk factors for AD when altering gene expression.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	219	 To date, promoter variations in PSEN1 and APOE have been shown to be associated with increased risk for AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Functional data suggested that the increased risk for AD could be explained by the effect of the promoter variations on transcriptional levels of both genes either by decreasing the levels of total expression (PSEN1) or by differentially influencing the expression levels of different isoforms (APOE).
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Further analysis of the transcriptional regulation of AD genes and of variations in their regulatory regions will lead to more insight into AD etiology.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	222	Multiple factors, both genetic and environmental, underlie the etiology of complex diseases like AD.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is therefore conceivable that an interplay of discrete transcriptional changes of different genes can influence disease processes.
0.5181356.11005793.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Analysis of regulatory regions of disease genes and the effect of variations on gene regulation is therefore very important for the elucidation of complex disease processes.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Polarized, laminin 1-positive renal vesicles were readily identifiable in PSEN-null kidney (Fig.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	173	 The epithelial nature of these mesenchymal derivatives was further confirmed by their positive staining for E-cadherin (present in both ductal and renal epithelia, green) and negative for cytokeratin 8 (ductal epithelium only, red) (Fig.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	174	 These results establish the notion that presenilins are not required for MET.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	175	Analysis of nephron patterning Detailed examination of NCAM-positive structures revealed that multiple types were identified, including laminin-low irregular aggregates (Fig.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	178	 4A, part d, thick arrow), suggesting that the pretubular aggregates progressed into renal vesicles and tubules in PSEN-null mutant kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Consistent with this assessment, the E-cadherin-positive renal derivatives in PSEN-null mutant, similar to the littermate control, have formed immature tubular structures which were either in close proximity (Fig.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This negative staining could be attributed by the lack of Dll induction caused by defective Notch signaling or by the absence of comma- and S-shaped bodies in PSEN-null mutant kidney.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	272	5, the mutant kidney was indistinguishable from that of littermate controls, as evidenced by the formation of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric buds.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	273	 However, the difference became apparent at E13.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	274	 While the control kidney undergoes further development to form pretubular aggregates, renal vesicles and comma- and S-shaped bodies, only pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles can be found in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In situ hybridization analyses of kidney development markers revealed that Gdnf and Bmp7 were normally expressed in PSEN-null kidney (data not shown), demonstrating that the uninduced mesenchyme was not affected by the loss of presenilins.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	276	 The positive staining of Pax2, Pax8 and Wnt4 in the mutant established that the metanephric mesenchyme was competent in receiving signals from the ureteric bud to form condensates and aggregates.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	277	 Last, the fact that Ret, which is a marker for the newly formed ureteric bud tips, was expressed similarly in the control and mutant at E13.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	278	5 suggests that presenilins do not exert a direct effect on primary branching morphogenesis.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	280	5 are likely caused by the absence of comma- and S-shaped bodies.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The combined effect led to impaired secondary and tertiary branching, as evidenced by the decreased number of Ret-positive tips in the mutant at E15.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	282	 This notion is supported by kidney organ culture experiments in which loss of presenilins only affected branching in a minor fashion while formation of glomeruli were completely blocked.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Limited secondary and tertiary branching and increased apoptotic cell death at later stages may in turn be the result of the failed progression through nephrogenesis in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	284	 These results, combined with our finding that presenilin -secretase activity is restricted to the mesenchymal derivatives, support a role for presenilins in the differentiation from pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles towards comma- and S-shaped bodies within the mesenchyme.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	285	Progression from pretubular aggregates to comma- and S-shaped bodies requires the conversion and patterning of mesenchymal cells into highly organized and polarized epithelia.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Analysis of cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins, NCAM and E-cadherin, revealed that renal vesicles and tubular derivatives were partially formed in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Importantly, laminin stained these renal structures suggesting that they developed polarized cells with basement membranes.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Thus, presenilins are not essential in the mesenchyme to epithelium transition.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	289	 However, despite the formation and apparent fusion of some E-cadherin positive distal renal tubule structures to the bud epithelium, mature proximal tubules and glomeruli were completely absent in PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	290	 This conclusion was supported by the negative binding to LTL and lack of expression of WT1, respectively.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	291	 From these data, we conclude that presenilins play an indispensable role in the patterning and differentiation of renal vesicles leading to proximal tubules and glomeruli.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	292	In contrast to inductive interactions and MET, our current understanding about nephron patterning is limited.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	293	 There are candidate regulatory mechanisms in tubule patterning by molecules such as the cadherins, which are differentially regulated in the various renal epithelial compartments (Cho et al.

0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	299	 Our analysis showed that the presenilin -secretase activated form of Notch1 (NICD), Notch downstream target Hesr1 and ligands Dll1 and Jag1 were expressed in mesenchymal derivatives and that their expressions were critically impaired in PSEN-null kidneys.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Thus, the Notch pathway, particularly signaling through Notch1, may be the underlying mediator for presenilin activity in kidney development.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	301	 It is noteworthy that mice expressing a hypomorphic allele of Notch2 exhibit kidney glomerulogenesis defects (McCright et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	302	 As all four mammalian Notch proteins are presenilin substrates in vitro (Saxena et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	303	, 2001), a defective Notch2-mediated pathway may also account for the PSEN-null kidney phenotype.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	304	 However, the presence of glomeruli in Notch2 mutant kidneys, albeit structurally abnormal, indicates that Notch2 functions downstream of tubule patterning (McCright et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	305	Although an essential role for the presenilins in Notch signaling has been well established, how this regulation affects Notch ligand expression has been the subject of controversy.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Some support a lateral inhibition model in which loss of Notch signaling resulting from presenilin deficiency leads to ectopic overexpression of the ligand (Donoviel et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	307	, 2000); Others suggest that presenilin-mediated Notch signaling is necessary for proper induction of its ligand (Takahashi et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	308	 The differences may be caused in part by variations of the systems of study; as ligand expression seems to be subjected to strict temporal-, spatial- and cell type-specific regulation.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	309	In kidney development, detailed examination of expression patterns of Jag1 and Dll1 yielded some interesting findings.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	310	(1) Jag1 is not expressed in condensed mesenchyme but its expression can be detected in pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	311	 This distinct Jag1 staining pattern was similar in the control and the PSEN-null kidneys at E14.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	312	5, suggesting that transition from condensed mesenchyme to pretubular aggregates does not depend on presenilins.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	313	 Interestingly, although pretubular aggregates and renal vesicles still exist in PSEN-null mutant at E16.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	314	 These data suggest that sustained Notch activation is necessary for the maintenance of Jag1 expression during nephrogenesis.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	315	(2) In contrast to Jag1, Dll1 message cannot be detected in pretubular aggregates.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	316	 In the control kidney, Dll1 expression seems to be restricted to a specific region of the comma- and S-shaped bodies at E14.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Although the origin of these cells is not known, this spatiotemporally restricted expression pattern may imply functional significance.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Indeed, during somite patterning, caudally restricted expression of Dll1 has been shown to be important for prefiguring somite identity, and proper Dll1 induction requires presenilin-dependent Notch signaling (Takahashi et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Equally possible, however, the absence of Dll1 expression could also be due to the physical lack of comma- and S-shaped bodies in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	320	Besides Notch and APP, numerous other proteins have been reported as substrates of presenilin-dependent proteolysis (Lammich et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Although the physiological significance is not clear, impaired processing of these molecules cannot be excluded as a potential mechanism for the kidney defects.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	322	 Through processing-independent mechanisms, PSEN1 has been shown to interact with ss-catenin and to facilitate its turnover (Kang et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Therefore, it is possible that deregulation of the ss-catenin pathway in the PSEN-null may contribute to the kidney phenotype.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	324	 The Wnt pathway has been implicated in the inductive phase of kidney development (Dressler, 2002), but is essentially unaffected in the PSEN-null.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	325	 In addition, we have created mice with a deletion of exon 10 of the endogenous Psen1 essential for ss-catenin interaction.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Homozygous exon 10-deleted mice, when crossed onto the Psen2-null background, are viable and do not exhibit kidney defects (H.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	327	 These observations thus argue against a potential ss-catenin involvement in the PSEN-null kidney.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	328	In addition to the kidney patterning defect, Psen1- and Psen2-double null embryos display other abnormalities, most noticeably defects in heart looping and vascular remodeling (Donoviel et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	329	 These defects were apparently corrected by the human PSEN1 transgene presumably because of its early expression in mesoderm and in relevant cell derivatives.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	330	 Indeed, the human Thy-1 promoter has been shown to be active in endothelial cells (Gordon et al.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	331	, 1987), and expression of Hesr1, although absent in developing nephrons of the PSEN-null kidney, can be detected in blood vessels.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	332	 The analysis of mechanisms leading to these phenotypes is currently ongoing.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	333	In summary, using our novel presenilin `rescue' system, we have identified a novel function of the presenilins in nephrogenesis.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	334	 Specifically, presenilins are indispensable for the patterning of renal epithelial structures to form mature proximal tubules and glomeruli.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	335	 Loss of presenilins is associated with failed progression from renal vesicles to comma- and S-shaped bodies.
0.49538547.12930775.html.plaintext.txt	336	 On the molecular level, we reveal an obligatory role of presenilins in the activation of Notch signaling and maintenance of the Notch ligand Jag1 expression in the mesenchymal derivatives during kidney development.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	5	 One of these cleavage events (termed -secretase) generates the C-terminal end of the A-peptide by proteolysis near residue 710 or 712 of APP770.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Another event (termed -like or -secretase cleavage) cleaves near residue 721 at ~2-5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary to generate a series of stable, C-terminal APP fragments.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This latter cleavage is analogous to S3-cleavage of Notch.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We report here that specific mutations in the N terminus, loop, or C terminus of PS1 all increase the production of A42 but cause inhibition of both -secretase cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These data support the hypothesis that -cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are similar events.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	12	The -amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events (Fig.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	13	 One processing event, which is mediated sequentially first by -secretase and then by -secretase, generates several proteolytic fragments, including a 40-42-amino acid fragment termed A and a number of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that contain the cytoplasmic tail of APP.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These CTFs have been variously termed "-stubs," "-stubs," or "APP intracellular domain" (AICD).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Detailed analysis of these products has revealed that the cleavage events that give rise to the C terminus of A occur after residues 40 or 42 of the -secretase stub (Fig.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	16	 However, those that give rise to the predominant, stable CTFs have an N terminus at residues 49, 50, or 52, which are located 2-5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (1-7).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These latter cleavage events and the S3-cleavage of Notch occur at approximately the same position relative to the inner surface of the membrane (i.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Consequently, it has been suggested that PS1 and PS2 mutations have a "gain-of-function" effect on -secretase activity.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Paradoxically, several of these mutations suppress the ability of human presenilin proteins to complement the Notch signaling phenotype induced by the loss-of-function C60S mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans (11, 12).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Conversely, the C60S loss-of-function mutation in the sel-12 presenilin homologue, which inhibits Notch processing of C.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, the -secretase cleavages of APP near residue 42 (15), the -cleavages of APP near residue 50 (1-5), and the S3-cleavage of Notch (7, 16) all appear to be presenilin-dependent.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	34	 It has been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the apparently opposing action of pathogenic presenilin mutations on A production in mammalian cells and on Notch cleavage in invertebrates.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We now report that, although PS1 mutations augment -secretase cleavage at residue 42, they in fact suppress both S3-cleavage of Notch and -cleavage of APP near residue 50.

0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This differential effect of these PS1 mutations provides insight into the complex, regulated, intramembranous proteolysis of type 1 membrane proteins such as APP and Notch.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	160	 First, our data support the growing body of evidence that suggests that -cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are likely to be similar, if not identical, proteolytic processing events (1-5).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The single difference that has been noted to date between the - and S3-cleavages is that S3-cleavage of Notch is sequence-dependent, whereas -cleavage of APP is not (1-5).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	162	Second, our data show that the increase in 42-cleavage of APP is accompanied by decreases in - and S3-cleavage activities.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This conclusion is entirely compatible with prior data that suggest that FAD-pathogenic mutations have a loss-of-function effect on S3-cleavage of Notch when examined both in vivo in C.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	164	 elegans and biochemically in vitro (7, 11, 12).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The reduction in S3-cleavage of Notch is modest, which provides an explanation for why FAD-associated mutations in PS1 do not have clinical evidence of embryonic defects in humans, who are usually heterozygous for PS1 mutations, and for why transgenes encoding FAD-linked PS1 mutants are able to rescue the Notch phenotype of PS1/ mice (27).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	166	 (We are, however, aware of one case with a compound heterozygote mutation in PS1 (M146V/S365T) in which the affected proband did have several minor congenital malformations (28)).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Our data are also in accord with previously published data indicating that when the C.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	168	 elegans sel-12 C60S loss-of-function mutant is expressed in mammalian cells as the human PS1-C92S homologue, it reduced processing of Notch and increased A42 production (13, 14).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	169	Finally, the reciprocal relationship between 42-secretase and the -secretase/S3-cleavage suggests that the molecular events leading to the production of A peptide are probably more complex than a single proteolytic cleavage.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	170	 It seems likely that both the -secretase and the -/S3-cleavage functions are presenilin-dependent.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, it remains unclear whether both - and -secretase cleavages are necessary for the generation of A, and if so, in which order these cleavage events occur.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The fact that an authentic -stub (containing residues 43-99) has never been observed has been taken to support the view that -cleavage may be the initial and necessary cleavage followed by a carboxyl-exopeptidase degradation back to residue 42.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, our data suggest that these two activities are more likely to be separate events.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Indeed, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that there are two pathways: a physiological pathway mediating - and S3-cleavage (to generate signal transduction molecules such as AICD and NICD) and a default pathway that generates A42.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	175	 These functionally distinct pathways, however, could still be subserved by the same catalytic machinery.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Thus, in the absence of the presenilin complex, neither pathway would be active.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, functional modulation of the presenilin complex (for instance, by missense mutations or by post-translational modification of the presenilins themselves) or of other components of the presenilin complex (e.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	178	 glycosylation of nicastrin) might alter the relative balance of - and -cleavage pathways.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	179	 We cannot, of course, preclude the alternate possibility that distinct structural components are involved in these two pathways.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Our data, in agreement with previously published data, show that although many missense mutations in the substrate for -/-secretase cleavage (C99-APP) can alter A production, they do not modulate -cleavage (1, 29).
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Such observations are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) the molecular mechanisms of substrate:catalysis interactions for A generation and -stub/NICD production are different and 2) PS1 mutations might primarily affect a regulatory function rather than directly execute catalytic cleavage.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	182	Cumulatively, our data provide the basis for arguing that -secretase cleavage, which results in the generation of A42, is functionally distinct from the cleavages necessary for the production of signaling molecules such as AICD and NICD.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	183	 More work must be undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these distinct pathways.
0.3291776.12119298.html.plaintext.txt	184	 However, when taken in conjunction with other results, our data raise the possibility of generating compounds that can selectively inhibit A peptide production while minimally affecting AICD or NICD production.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This makes VR22 an attractive candidate gene because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1, which has many mutations that elevate Ass42 and cause early onset familial AD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We identified two intronic VR22 SNPs (4360 and 4783) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) that showed highly significant association (P=0.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This association clearly contributed to the linkage at 80 cM because the lod scores decreased when linkage analysis was performed conditional upon the VR22 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This association replicated in another independent set of 12 LOAD families (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Bounding of the association region using multiple SNPs showed VR22 to be the only confirmed gene within the region of association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings indicate that VR22 has variant(s) which influence Ass42 and contribute to the previously reported linkage for plasma Ass42 in LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a complex genetic disorder (1) with an onset defined as  > 60 to 65 years of age.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Twin studies have suggested that as much as 74% of the risk for LOAD may be due to genetic factors (2,3).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It is well established that ApoE plays an important role in the genetics of LOAD (4,5).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A recent study has estimated, however, that four additional loci make a contribution to the variance in LOAD age at onset that have an effect size similar to or greater than that of ApoE (6).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Given the heterogeneity that is likely if at least five loci contribute substantially to the genetics of LOAD, it is not surprising that the large number of single gene association studies that have been performed have so far failed to identify variants that associate reproducibly with LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other reasons for failure of replication are possible gene to gene, gene to environment interactions that can be difficult to account for and poor study design.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	20	Several groups (7 to 9) have suggested that quantitative, intermediate phenotypes may be useful in unraveling the complex genetics of disorders such as LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Clinical disease states such as LOAD are likely to result from an uncertain, complex sequence of pathophysiologic events whereas intermediate phenotypes may be more directly related to the action of a set of genes that are more easily identified.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Thus the identification of genes with variants that contribute to specific intermediate phenotypes may be a tractable way to identify at least some of the genes that contribute to diseases governed by complex genetics.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To optimize the utility of this approach, it is important to select intermediate phenotypes that are highly heritable and have a close biological link to the disease in question.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	24	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	35	The APP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes have many, fully penetrant mutations that cause early onset familial AD (EOFAD) (22 to 25).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Apart from its early onset and causation by specific mutations, EOFAD is clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Importantly, we observed plasma Ass42 elevations both in EOFAD patients and in young, cognitively normal carriers of EOFAD mutations (31).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We also observed Ass42 elevations in plasma from non-demented relatives of LOAD patients between the ages of 20 and 65 (32).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Importantly, these elevations were not associated with the ApoE4 allele or with variants in any of the EOFAD genes (32).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	41	 (33) found in a longitudinal study of unrelated elderly individuals, that those who subsequently developed AD had higher plasma levels of Ass42 than did those who remained free of dementia.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Collectively these findings show that Ass42 is closely linked to AD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	43	 To investigate the heritability of plasma Ass, we analyzed extended LOAD families and found that plasma Ass40 and Ass42 levels both have substantial heritability (34).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	44	Given these findings that the level of plasma Ass42 was likely to be useful as an intermediate, quantitative phenotype for LOAD, we performed variance components linkage analysis on this trait in a group of extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This analysis showed significant linkage to a locus at 80 cM on chromosome 10 (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs (36).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The sib-pair group estimated the effect of this locus to be equivalent to that of ApoE, suggesting that it was likely to be a major risk factor for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	49	 A third group found linkage in a more downstream region of chromosome 10 and focused on the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a possible candidate gene in this region (37).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	50	 More recently, a fourth group using age of onset as a quantitative phenotype in AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) families found suggestive linkage to chromosome 10 at 133 to 135 cM (38).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	51	An important advantage of the variance components approach employed here is that candidate genes, identified through their likely effect on Ass42, can be evaluated systematically to determine how much various within-gene variants contribute to linkage.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	56	 -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	57	 -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	58	 -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	59	 (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	61	 (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	65	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Association between VR22 SNPs and plasma Ass42 In our initial assessment of VR22, we examined three SNPs [4825 (C/A), 4783 (A/G) and 4360 (T/C)] in the intron between exons 10 and 11.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	66	 These SNPs (Table 1), which spanned 465 bp, were genotyped in the 10 extended LOAD families previously analyzed for linkage (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The effect of each of the three VR22 SNPs was analyzed by encoding it as a covariate and testing its effect on the variance of plasma Ass42 in a regression style approach implemented in SOLAR (Table 1).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To control for the effect of linkage, the linkage component was included in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The 4360 (T/C) and 4783 (A/G) SNPs, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, both showed strong association (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The 4825 SNP showed only marginal association (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	72	 All three SNPs were also examined in a second set of 12 additional LOAD families (Table 1) (34).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The VR22 4783 SNP showed significant association (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	74	04), VR22 4360 SNP yielded marginal association (P=0.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	77	 When all 22 families were combined, the significance of association reached P=5.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Consistent with the association results, a genotype dependent effect on plasma Ass levels is observed, where 4360 TT genotype is associated with the highest Ass42 levels, CT with intermediate levels and CC with lowest levels.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	83	  To determine if other SNPs in this region of the VR22 gene show stronger association, we analyzed 10 additional SNPs for a total of 13 SNPs analyzed in a region spanning 8.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	84	8 kb (Table 2, hCV3096482 to hCV11295092).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	85	8 kb region were in linkage disequilibrium.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Many SNPs in this region showed nominally significant association, but none showed association stronger than that observed with 4360 and 4783 (Table 1).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	87	 P-values for association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old subjects from extended LOAD families   Bounding of the association between VR22 SNPs and plasma Ass42 To bound the region of VR22 4360/4783 association, we evaluated a total of 49 additional SNPs spaced on either side of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The known exons in VR22 were 43.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	90	3 kb (median) away from the closest SNP in the closest SNP group (mean=53.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Given that the extent of LD in the human genome was estimated in different studies to be anywhere between 10 and  > 100  kb (41 to 45); and that this extent in any one genomic region is not predictable a priori, it is possible to miss association signals due to variants in-between our SNP groups.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Using a covariate style regression approach, each SNP was analyzed for association with plasma Ass42 in the 10, 12 and 22 combined LOAD families (Table 2 and Fig.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	101	  On both the 3 and the 5 sides of the strongly associating 4360 SNP, LD with flanking SNPs fell to essentially baseline levels within the large VR22 gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	102	 On the 5 side, SNP association with Ass42 also decreased to baseline levels within the VR22 gene (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	103	 On the 3 side, the significance of SNP association decreased by more than 2 orders of magnitude (from 0.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Association was at baseline levels on the 3 side 1 000 kb from the 3 margin of VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	106	This bounding approach effectively limits the region of potential association on both the 3 and 5 sides of 4360 to within VR22.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Thus, our data provide strong evidence that the association of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs with plasma Ass42 is due to variant(s) in the VR22 gene.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	108	Given that a total of 51 SNPs were genotyped, the issue of multiple testing can be raised.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Many of the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and therefore are not independent from one another (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Therefore, a simple Bonferroni correction under the assumption of 51 independent tests is overly conservative for this study.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Nonetheless, even when Bonferroni correction is applied, the 4783 and 4360 SNPs are still significant in the 10 families (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	112	005) and the 22 combined families (P=0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The association in the smaller set of 12 families are no longer significant after this overly conservative correction (P=2 and 4 for 4783 and 4360, respectively), nonetheless their inclusion in the analysis leads to improved evidence for association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	114	Contribution of VR22 association to linkage at 80 cM We next investigated the contribution of the VR22 4360/4783 association to the linkage that we previously reported.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Our initial linkage findings were obtained using seven markers covering 14 cM on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	116	 To analyze the entirety of chromosome 10, we genotyped 26 additional markers spanning 165 cM in the 10 LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	117	 When all 10 families were combined, the best two point lod scores were obtained with 4783 (2.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The peak described by the multipoint lod scores broadened and flattened considerably with the incorporation of the additional markers, but the maximum multipoint lod score continued to be at 80 cM (Fig.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	124	  The reason for the broader and flatter peak in this fine-mapping analysis may be several-fold.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	125	 First, we utilized the MCMC MIBD estimation implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47) for the multipoint linkage results presented in this paper as opposed to the regression-based MIBD estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was used in our original paper (34, see also Subjects and Methods).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Second, genotyping of additional markers leads to more information regarding recombination that could potentially lead to a decrease in the original linkage signal obtained by fewer markers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Third, utilizing a larger number of markers increases the likelihood of map or genotyping errors, despite the implementation of strict genotype-quality control measures.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Indeed, others have also found that fine-mapping with more markers can lead to a lowering in their original lod scores obtained with a lesser number of markers (48,49).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	129	To evaluate the extent to which the 4360 and 4783 SNPs [or functional SNP(s) associated with this tightly linked pair] account for the linkage observed, we repeated linkage analysis after regressing out the effect of the VR22 4360 association by including it as a covariate in the linkage model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	130	 After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The residual linkage signal that persisted after regressing out the VR22 4360 association indicates that there are likely to be additional variants that contribute to linkage, though this residual signal may also be due to random variation.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The diminution in the maximum multipoint lod scores, upon inclusion of the 4360 SNP as a covariate, is also evident from the comparison of the variance component model that excludes this covariate (Table 3B) to the one that includes it (Table 3C).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The P-value for the major gene effect at the maximum multipoint locus goes from 0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The same trend is observed when the twopoint linkage for the 4360 SNP is assessed with and without including 4360 as a covariate (Table 3D and E).

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We found two VR22 SNPs, 4360 and 4783, which showed significant, robust association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old family members of the extended LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	139	 These two SNPs are 423 bp apart, and they are in such strong LD that they give virtually identical results.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The 4360 and 4783 SNPs are located in the 177 kb intron between exons 10 and 11 at a distance of 1.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We identified 11 additional SNPs within 6 kb of 4360/4783, eight in the intron between exons 10 and 11 and three in the intron between exons 11 and 12, but none of these SNPs gave more significant association than 4360/4783.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Careful bounding showed that the large (1.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	143	7 Mb) VR22 gene is the only confirmed gene within the region of 4360/4783 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Analyses in which 4360 was used as a covariate in both the null and linkage models reduced the multipoint lod score indicating that the VR22 4360/4783 association contributes to linkage.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The large reduction observed when all 10 families were analyzed suggests that the 4360/4783 association contributes substantially to the linkage signal observed in these families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The presence of residual linkage after regressing out the effect of VR22 4360 SNP indicates, however, that the 4360 association does not entirely account for linkage.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Thus our data provide substantial evidence that VR22 variant(s) contribute to the linkage signal we previously reported.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Though the residual linkage signal may be due to random variation, it could also indicate that there may be additional variants that contribute to linkage.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Whether these variants are in the large VR22 gene or in nearby gene(s) remains to be determined.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	150	Since they are intronic SNPs located 1.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	151	4 kb from the nearest exon, 4360 and 4783 are unlikely to have a functional effect, and their association with Ass42 presumably occurs because they are in LD with one or several functional VR22 SNPs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Our sequencing of all VR22 exons in the only reported VR22 transcript (39) failed to identify any potentially functional SNP(s) that could account for the 4360/4783 association.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It is possible that there are functional SNPs that affect the splicing of known or alternatively spliced exons, in strong LD with 4360/4783.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	154	The basic premise in studying plasma Ass42 as an intermediate phenotype is that genes with variants that influence plasma Ass42 will be genes with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	156	 An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	157	 It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	159	 It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	160	 It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	161	The results reported here indicate that VR22 variants significantly associate with plasma Ass42 and account for a substantial portion of our linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Additional analysis is needed to identify the entire set of functional variants that account for the Ass42 linkage at 80 cM.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Once they are identified it will be important to test their effects on Ass production and VR22 gene function by biological experiments; as well as to determine whether these functional variants modify the risk for AD.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	164	   SUBJECTS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Subjects We collected 10 extended LOAD families composed of 292 individuals, 205 of whom were between the ages of 20 and 65.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	167	 One of the probands from the  non-extreme  families was determined to have extremely high plasma Ass levels after the family collection; therefore this family was grouped with the  extreme families  subsequently.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Except for this one family, the distinction between the  extreme  and  non-extreme  families were made a priori, before the family collection, based on the plasma Ass42 levels of the proband.

0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The order and location of 27 chromosome 10 microsatellite markers were determined from the Marshfield linkage map.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Two markers, D10S1435 and D10S1211, which did not have locations on the Marshfield linkage map (51), were placed on the linkage map according to the location estimates obtained from the MAP-O-MAT program (http://compgen.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Two SNPs found in the VR22 gene were also used as markers in linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	182	 These SNPs, 4360TC and 4783AG, are located at 61137462 and 61137039 bp, respectively, on the chromosome 10 genomic map in the Celera database (http://www.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The two SNPs were placed on the linkage map based on their approximate centimorgan locations estimated from the physical maps.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	184	Identification and genotyping of SNPs The VR22 genomic and mRNA sequences were initially obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site using the genomic contig NT_008663 and AF091606.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In order to identify SNPs, primers were designed to cover all known exons and a 7 kb intronic region between exons 10 and 11.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	186	 LOAD cases, elderly control subjects and family members from the extended LOAD pedigrees were then sequenced to identify polymorphisms.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The initial sequencing of the VR22 exons and the 7 kb intronic region identified three SNPs in the intronic 7 kb region (4825, 4783 and 4360).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Subsequently, many additional SNPS in VR22 and flanking genes were identified using the Celera database.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Our aim was to cover this region using SNP groups that are located at every 250 kb, with each group composed of 3 to 5 SNPs separated by 1 to 5 kb.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	190	 A total of 51 SNPs, including VR22 4360 and 4783 were genotyped throughout VR22 and the 3 (ANXA2P3) and 5 (SIRT1) flanking genes.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The SNPs within each group were found to be in strong LD with each other.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The SNP locations were obtained from the Celera sequence map.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	193	Variance components analysis We employed the variance components methodology, implemented in the software package SOLAR (53,54) to estimate the heritability of plasma Ass42 levels and to perform linkage and association analyses to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that affect the variance of Ass42 in our extended LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	194	 This method, described in detail elsewhere (53,54), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait due to a particular genetic locus (q2), residual genetic factors (g2) and individual-specific, random environmental factors (e2), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The covariance matrix takes the form.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	196	where is the matrix of the probabilities that each pair of individuals share genetic material identical by descent for a given chromosomal location (estimated from the genetic marker data), 2 is the matrix of kinship coefficients describing polygenic factors and I is the identity matrix describing sporadic environmental factors.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	197	In addition, the effect of shared-environment (h2) on the variance of the trait can also be estimated by including a household matrix in the model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	204	 For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	207	The scalars q2, g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	208	 For heritability estimations, we compared an environmental model where q2 and g2 were fixed at zero and h2 and e2 were estimated, to the polygenic model where g2, h2 and e2 were estimated.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	211	 We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	212	 None of these covariates were significant at P < 0.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	213	05 therefore, they were excluded from the multipoint linkage analysis.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	214	In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	219	 All samples were measured in duplicate.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The results from these five standard samples were used to normalize the values obtained so as to reduce plate-to-plate and day-to-day variance.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	222	Identity-by-descent probability estimations The identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities at each genotyped marker were estimated using the pairwise likelihood-based estimation method implemented in SOLAR (53).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The results of the latter are presented here.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	230	 There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	234	 (47), demonstrated significant differences between the results obtained by these two methods using the same dataset and concluded that the multipoint MCMC approach yielded more accurate MIBD probability estimates for inter-marker loci.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	235	 For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	236	Tests of association We initially tested for association between the SNPs and plasma Ass42 in the 10 extended LOAD families using a regression based covariate approach in the variance components paradigm implemented in the computer program SOLAR (53).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, we included the linkage component (q2) in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We used the multipoint IBD matrix () that yielded the maximum multipoint lod score at 80 cM in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The multipoint IBD probabilities in the matrix , were estimated in Simwalk, using the genetic marker information as described above.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	240	To test the effect of specific SNP genotypes, we used the measured genotype approach where we included the copy number of the SNP allele as a covariate in the analysis and regressed the plasma Ass42 phenotype on this covariate for each individual.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	243	 For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	248	 We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	250	 We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	251	Linkage analysis conditional upon association A conditional linkage analysis that accounts for association with a functional polymorphism (or one in strong LD with it) at the linkage locus will decrease or eliminate the linkage signal (58,59).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	252	 For this reason, we performed linkage analysis conditional on the association with our most strongly associating SNP (4360TC).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	253	 We performed this test by estimating the proportion of variance due to linkage on the background of a model that included this SNP as a covariate and comparing it to a linkage only model that excluded this covariate.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	254	Analysis of linkage disequilibrium We measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs and the haplotype groups within the 22 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (60).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We used the expectation-maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (61) to determine various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient D (62).
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This algorithm determines LD from the founders and married-ins.
0.4394662.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	257	 LD was estimated between the VR22 4360 SNP and all other SNPs.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	6	Mutations of presenilin 1 (PS1) causing Alzheimer's disease selectively increase the secretion of the amyloidogenic ssA4(1-42), whereas knocking out the gene results in decreased production of both ssA4(1-40) and (1-42) amyloid peptides (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Therefore, PS1 function is closely linked to the -secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Given the ongoing controversy on the subcellular localization of PS1, it remains unclear at what level of the secretory and endocytic pathways PS1 exerts its activity on APP and on the APP carboxy-terminal fragments that are the direct substrates for -secretase.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, we have reinvestigated the subcellular localization of endogenously expressed PS1 in neurons in vitro and in vivo using confocal microscopy and fine-tuned subcellular fractionation.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We show that uncleaved PS1 holoprotein is recovered in the nuclear envelope fraction, whereas the cleaved PS fragments are found mainly in post-ER membranes including the intermediate compartment (IC).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	11	 PS1 is concentrated in discrete sec23p- and p58/ERGIC-53 to positive patches, suggesting its localization in subdomains involved in ER export.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	12	 PS1 is not found to significant amounts beyond the cis-Golgi.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Surprisingly, we found that APP carboxy-terminal fragments also coenrich in the pre-Golgi membrane fractions, consistent with the idea that these fragments are the real substrates for -secretase.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Functional evidence that PS1 exerts its effects on -secretase processing of APP in the ER/IC was obtained using a series of APP trafficking mutants.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These mutants were investigated in hippocampal neurons derived from transgenic mice expressing PS1wt or PS1 containing clinical mutations (PS1M146L and PS1L286V) at physiologically relevant levels.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	16	 We demonstrate that the APP-London and PS1 mutations have additive effects on the increased secretion of ssA4(1-42) relative to ssA4(1-40), indicating that both mutations operate independently.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Overall, our data clearly establish that PS1 controls 42-secretase activity in pre-Golgi compartments.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	18	 We discuss models that reconcile this conclusion with the effects of PS1 deficiency on the generation of ssA4(1-40) peptide in the late biosynthetic and endocytic pathways.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	21	THE molecular cascades causing the complex neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 are far from resolved.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	22	, senile plaques and tangles, of sporadic and familial AD (FAD) are nevertheless similar, suggesting a common pathogenic pathway.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This allows us to approach the complicated problem of the pathogenesis of the sporadic form by the study of the genes and gene products involved in FAD.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Most of the familial forms of AD are caused by missense mutations in the genes coding for presenilin 1 (PS1) and 2.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The PS1/2 genes encode proteins of 467 and 448 amino acids, respectively, and show an overall amino acid similarity of 67% (Levy-Lahad et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Their homology with a series of related Caenorhabditis elegans proteins indicates a conserved, albeit incompletely understood, function throughout evolution (Levitan and Greenwald 1995 ; Baumeister and Haass 1998 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Hydropathy plots suggest up to 10 hydrophobic regions, of which most probably only 8 actually traverse the membrane (Li and Greenwald 1996 , Li and Greenwald 1998 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Both the amino and carboxy termini as well as the large loop domain between hydrophobic regions 6 and 8 are orientated to the cytoplasm (Doan et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	29	 1997 ; Li and Greenwald 1998 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	30	Although PS is synthesized as a full-length protein of ~45 kD, it undergoes proteolytic cleavage within its hydrophilic loop domain, resulting in the generation of stable amino-terminal (PS1-NTF) and carboxyl-terminal fragments (PS1-CTF) in a 1:1 stoichiometry (Mercken et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Except for the G209V PS1 mutation (Levey et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	32	 1997 ), all missense mutations studied to date do not influence endoproteolysis significantly (Thinakaran and Sisodia 1998 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The deletion mutant PS1exon 9, in which exon 9 encoding the cleavage site is deleted, prevents endoproteolysis and also causes FAD, indicating that the clipping by itself is not a prerequisite to develop the disease (Thinakaran et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At least one common effect of the clinical mutations is an increased secretion of the highly amyloidogenic ssA4(1-42) peptide as compared with the ssA4(1-40) peptide.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This effect has been demonstrated in cells derived from affected individuals (Scheuner et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	36	 1996 ) as well as in transfected cells and brains of transgenic mice (Borchelt et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The amyloid peptides are derived from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP) through consecutive clipping by two, hitherto unknown, proteinases called ss- and -secretase.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A third enzyme, -secretase, cleaves the protein in the amyloid region, precluding the formation of these amyloid peptides (Haass and Selkoe 1993 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	39	 PS1 is directly involved in -secretase processing of APP, as was demonstrated using knockout models.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Targeted deletion of the PS1 gene resulted in a greatly diminished production of ssA4(1-42) as well as (1-40) peptides.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	41	 As ss- (and -) clipping was virtually normal in neurons derived from those animals, the effect on APP processing is confined to -secretase activities (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	42	 This observation was recently considerably extended by the demonstration that site-directed mutagenesis of either one of two aspartic residues in the transmembrane domain 6 or 7, respectively, of PS1 results in a dominant negative form of the protein (Brockhaus et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In cells overexpressing these mutant forms, a similar inhibition of -secretase processing is observed as in the PS1-deficient cells (Wolfe et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	44	 These results are compatible with a catalytic role of presenilin.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, it remains difficult to explain how presenilin, which is predominantly located in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathways, can influence the processing of APP, which is thought to occur mainly in the late compartments of this pathway, at the cell surface, and endosomes (Sambamurti et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	46	 1992 ; Sisodia 1992 ; De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	47	 1993 ; Koo and Squazzo 1994 ; Haass et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	48	The important issue raised by all these observations is how presenilins can affect -secretase processing.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Indeed, from a cell biological point of view at least three possibilities present themselves: (1) PS1 is indeed more widely distributed than believed until now and is located beyond the Golgi apparatus; (2) APP to carboxy-terminal stubs are redirected to the ER after their generation in the Golgi apparatus in trafficking vesicles and at the cell surface; or (3) PS1 affects -secretase and APP sorting to a common subcellular compartment or microenvironment, affecting -secretase processing of APP indirectly.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	50	 To address this problem, we have reinvestigated the subcellular localization of the presenilins and the APP carboxy-terminal stubs using advanced cell fractionation and confocal microscopy and a panel of well-characterized subcellular marker proteins.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	51	 In addition, a series of APP sorting mutants was used to delineate functionally the subcellular compartment(s) where PS1 exerts its activity.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	52	 We focused our study on (transgenic) mouse brain and primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, thereby avoiding possible artifacts that could arise from overexpression of presenilins.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Indeed, in transiently or stable transfected cell lines, overexpressed PS1 exists in the ER and Golgi compartments mainly as an uncleaved holoprotein, in contrast to the normal in vivo situation where PS1 is present as cleaved fragments (Kovacs et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	54	 It is far from clear whether this overexpressed full-length protein remains biological functional and whether it remains located in its physiologically relevant compartment (Kovacs et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In contrast, transgenic mice expressing PS1 do not accumulate full-length protein and display physiological relevant levels of the cleaved fragments (Borchelt et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In this study, brains and neurons derived from mice expressing endogenous levels of mouse PS1, human wild-type PS1, PS1M146L or PS1L286V were used.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The Semliki Forest virus (SFV) expression system allowed expression of APP as documented before (Liljestrom and Garoff 1991 ; De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	58	 We paid particular attention to the effects of the PS mutations on the formation of APP intermediate metabolites, such as the - and ss-cleaved stubs, since this aspect of APP metabolism has been somewhat neglected in previous studies.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In addition, we addressed the question of the combined effects of PS1 and the APP London mutation on APP processing.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Finally, three sorting mutants of APP were analyzed: one mainly processed in the early secretory pathway (APP/KK), one in the late secretory pathway (APP-CT), and, finally, one targeted to the endosomal recycling compartment (APP/LDLR).

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Thus, the PS1 immunoreactivity in the low density region (fractions 4 and 5) of the gradient cannot be explained by contaminating RER membranes.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Given the restricted distribution of PS1 in the ER, IC, and early cis-Golgi compartments, the question arises how the -secretase cleavage of these APP stubs can be controlled by PS1.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	302	Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of endogenous APP in the same fractions analyzed before for presenilin immunoreactivity.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	303	 As shown in Figure 5 a, both the gradient distributions of the APP holoprotein and the APP carboxy-terminal fragments were bimodal, which is similar to what was found for PS1 (Figure 3 a).

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	305	 Further purification resulted in the concomitant enrichment for the APP carboxy-terminal fragments in the F3 interface (Figure 5 b), where PS1 is also recovered.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Remarkably, this enrichment was much less obvious for the APP holoprotein, suggesting a selective accumulation of the carboxy-terminal APP fragments in this fraction.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Interestingly, therefore, the carboxy-terminal fragments of APP are apparently at least partially codistributing with PS1-NTF and -CTF in the same subcellular membrane compartments (see Discussion).

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	350	 We also investigated the effects of the clinical APP/London mutation in combination with the PS1 mutations, to see whether these mutations operate additively or not.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	351	 The APP constructs were expressed in neurons using the SFV expression system.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Similar expression levels for all constructs were obtained in hippocampal cultures, except for APPCT (Figure 8, CELL).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	353	 For comparisons between the different experiments, the obtained phosphorimaging results were normalized to the expression levels of APP holoprotein in the cell extracts.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Expression of APPCT led to decreased ssA4 secretion concomitantly with the production of a short cell-associated ss-stub.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	355	 In the case of APP/KK infection, the decrease of secreted ssA4 was even more pronounced (also see below).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The APP/KK mutant is actively retrieved from the cis-Golgi to the ER as a consequence of the dilysine motif.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	358	 The striking colocalization of endogenous PS1 with virally expressed APP/KK (Figure 9 c, inset) should be noticed.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	359	 As a control, SFV-APPwt is shown, which confirms the axonal delivery of this protein (Figure 9 a) (Simons et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	360	 We analyzed systematically the metabolism of the expressed APP mutants (Table 1).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Quantitative immunoprecipitation and phosphorimaging determined the total amounts of cell-associated - and ss-stubs and secreted ssA4.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	362	 To standardize and to allow comparisons between different experiments, we normalized all values to cell-associated APP holoprotein.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Similarly, normalization of the numbers obtained in the ELISA experiments was performed because of the relative large variations in the absolute amounts of peptide produced in separate independent experiments.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	392	 The clinical mutations in PS1 do not affect - and ss-secretase activity, complementing the data obtained previously in PS1-deficient neurons (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	393	 However, in the case of the London mutant, levels of - and ss-stubs were surprisingly decreased in the FAD mutant PS1 neurons.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	394	 This reflects probably the increased turnover of both stubs by -secretase cleavage, in accordance with the strong additive effects of the London- and FAD-linked PS1 mutations (especially PS1M146L) on -secretase processing (see below).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	395	To evaluate -secretase activities, we measured the total pool of secreted ssA4 by immune precipitation as well as the ratio of the individual peptides by ELISA.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	396	 A modest increase in the total amount of secreted ssA4 was observed for the PS1M146L mutant.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	397	 This effect was not very dramatic (except for the APP/KK, see below).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	398	 In contrast, PS1 mutations caused dramatic increases in the ssA4(1-42) to ssA4(1-40) peptide ratio, and this effect was even more pronounced when the effect of the mild overexpression of PS1wt alone was directly compared with that of PS1 containing clinical mutations.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	399	 The PS1M146L mutation was overall more effective than the PS1L286V mutation.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	400	The London mutation on its own caused a threefold increase (3.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	401	43; n = 6) in the ratio of secreted ssA4(1-42)/(1-40) versus APP wild-type in control neurons (not shown).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	402	 Interestingly, an additional rise in this ratio was observed in combination with PS1 mutations (Table 1 B).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	403	07 (n = 8) for the PS1L286V mutation to 2.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	404	65 (n = 3) for the PS1M146L mutation.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	405	 When compared with APPwt expressed in wild-type neurons, the total raise ranged up to 12.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	406	 The increase appears to be solely due to an increased secretion of the ss4A(1-42) peptide and not a consequence of a decreased ssA4(1-40) production, explaining the decrease in - and ss-carboxy-terminal fragments as mentioned above.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	407	APPCT in control neurons yielded low levels of secreted ssA4.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	408	 However, the ratio between the two peptides was slightly raised compared with SFV-APPwt (1.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	409	 This ratio increased even further when this mutant was expressed in PS1M146L neurons (Table 1 C).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	410	 For APP/KK, the total secretion of ssA4(1-40) was also lowered dramatically to 5.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	411	6% (n = 6) when compared with APPwt (see also Figure 8).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	412	 The ssA4(1-42) secretion was not affected as strongly as the ssA4(1-40) secretion and only dropped to 18.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	413	7% (n = 6) when compared with APPwt.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The introduction of the ER-retrieving dilysine motif on its own, therefore, caused an appreciable increase in the 42:40 ratio of the secreted peptides to 3.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	415	70 (n = 6) times relative to APPwt.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	416	 Upon expression in PS1M146L neurons, an additional raise in this ratio of 2.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	417	57 (n = 6, Table 1 D) was observed.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	418	 The increase could again solely be contributed to an increased secretion of the ssA4(1-42) peptide.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Interestingly, only for this construct, a sharp rise in total secreted ssA4 was noticed in PS1M146L neurons.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	420	 It should be noticed that the main peptide produced by APP/KK is ssA4(1-42).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	421	 This observation indicates that some of the presenilin mutations do not only affect the ratio of the secreted peptides, but can also increase the total production of ssA4(1-42).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	422	 The results obtained with this ER-retained APP/KK mutant also indicate that the clinical PS mutations are operating in the ER.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	423	 This conclusion was further corroborated in an experiment comparing the amyloid peptide production from APP/LDLR in control and PS1M146L hippocampal neurons.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	424	 As expected for a mutant trafficking mainly in the endocytic compartments, a relative increase in secreted ssA4(1-40) of 2.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	425	18 (n = 3, SEM) fold was observed, whereas secretion of ssA4(1-42) remained largely unaffected.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	426	 Interestingly, the PS1M146L mutation did not cause a statistically significant effect on the ratio of secreted ssA4 peptides in these neurons.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Finally, we note that in our experimental system, and for all APP constructs studied, PS1 clinical mutations do not cause a significant increase in the ssA4(1-42)/(1-40) ratio of intracellular peptides.

0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	429	In this study, we provide conclusive evidence that the bulk of endogenously expressed PS1 in neurons is localized in the early compartments of the secretory pathway, i.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	430	, in the ER, the IC, and the early Golgi.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	431	 Relatively limited levels of PS1 are furthermore detected in the nuclear envelope and the RER.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	432	 The ER, in contrast to the Golgi apparatus, is widely distributed in the soma and the dendrites (including the most distal regions) of neurons (Krijnse-Locker et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	433	 Therefore, our data explain the previously documented somatodendritic localization of the presenilins (Cook et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Within these early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway, a clear gradient of increasing amounts of the supposedly functional PS1 fragments is observed.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	435	 The PS1 immunoreactivity previously detected in the nuclear membrane (Li et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	436	 1997 ) is, therefore, a mixture of (predominantly) PS1 fragments and full-length PS1, indicating that cleavage of PS1 by the unknown presenilinase occurs very early after biosynthesis (Xia et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	437	 Importantly, these results definitively resolve the controversy whether and where full-length presenilin can be detected, namely in nuclear envelope fractions.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	438	Interestingly, both the PS1-NTF and -CTF codistributed and coenriched in all fractionation schemes applied, confirming at the endogenous level of protein expression that both fragments remain in a 1:1 stoichiometric relationship along the whole early biosynthetic pathway (Thinakaran et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Our data not only settle the debate on the subcellular localization of presenilin, but also document for the first time that PS1 immunoreactivity in the ER is concentrated in discrete patches that are sec23p-positive.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Sec23p is one out of the five cytosolic proteins that constitute the COPII coat complex required for vesicle budding from the ER (Barlowe et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	441	 These COPII components bind specifically with cargo molecules destined for sorting into transport vesicles and separate them from the ER resident proteins (Campbell and Schekman 1997 ; Aridor et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	442	 The formation of COPII transport vesicles occurs nonrandomly in the ER at tubular protrusions often juxtaposed to VTC, referred to as the IC (Schweizer et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	443	 1991 ; Bannykh and Balch 1998 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	444	 PS1 codistributes and coenriches with markers of this intriguing compartment such as p58/ERGIC-53 (Saraste and Svensson 1991 ; Schweizer et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	445	 1991 ), suggesting that PS1 is operating in these compartments.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	446	 A similar conclusion was recently made by Culvenor et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	447	 1997 who, based on temperature block experiments, suggested that PS1 is localized in the IC and cis-Golgi in stably transfected SY5Y and P19 cell lines.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	448	 On the other hand, and in contrast with many earlier studies investigating overexpressed PS1 (for instance De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	449	 1997 ), we could not confirm that PS1 at the endogenous level of expression distributes to a significant extent into the Golgi apparatus.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	450	 This limits the subcellular compartment where PS1 is operating to the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	451	 The earlier reported abundant Golgi localization of the presenilins is probably a consequence of overexpression and missorting of the protein.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	452	 As illustrated in Figure 4 B, f and i, colocalization studies should indeed be carefully interpreted.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	453	 As we suggested before (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	454	 1997 ), experiments based on overexpression of presenilins may lead to erroneous conclusions since normal proteolytic maturation and also normal subcellular ER localization is apparently significantly disturbed.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	455	This conclusion is further corroborated by recent findings that overexpression of presenilins results in their redistribution into aggresomes (Johnston et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	456	 These structures are located at the perinuclear microtubule organizing center, where also the Golgi apparatus is located and are the signature of abnormal biosynthetic stress in the cell.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	457	 In view of our new data, it is conceivable that PS1 passes from the ER, via VTCs, to cis-Golgi cisternae.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	458	 The close colocalization of PS1 with sec23p further indicates that at least part of this transport is associated with the trafficking of COPII vesicles.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	459	 Since PS1 fragments exist as a stable complex with a long half-life (Ratovitski et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	460	 1997 ) and no accumulation in the Golgi apparatus was observed, PS1 is probably also retrogradely transported.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	461	 Electron microscopical observations demonstrating abundant PS1 immunoreactivity in vesiculotubular structures and coated vesicles in close vicinity or in continuity with Golgi cisternae support the view that presenilins are actively transported back and forward between the ER and cis-Golgi (Lah et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	462	 The lack of PS1 immunoreactivity in TGN-enriched fractions (Figure 4 A) suggests that only minimal amounts of PS1, if any, exit the Golgi area.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	463	 Indeed, no significant amounts of PS1 were found in recycling endosomes, lysosomes, synaptic vesicles, or clathrin-coated vesicles (not shown and Efthimiopoulos et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	464	 Finally, all published data that support the localization of PS1 at the plasma membrane (Dewji and Singer 1997 ; Schwarzman et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	465	 1999 ) imply a topology of PS1 with the amino-terminal domain at the luminal side of the ER.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	466	 This is not in agreement with several studies (Doan et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	467	 1996 ; Li and Greenwald 1996 ; De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	468	 1997 ) that addressed this question more specifically, although it could be speculated that cell type to specific differences exist.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	469	 In any event, our data in hippocampal neurons clearly indicate that the bulk of PS1 fragments are localized in compartments of the early biosynthetic pathway and that only limited amounts (if any at all) traffic beyond the Golgi apparatus, a finding that needs to be taken into account when considering the association of presenilin with - secretase activities.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	470	Accumulating evidence indicate that presenilins are either part of the catalytic -secretase activity (Wolfe et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	471	 1999 ) or at least controlling its activity (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	472	 1999 presented evidence that presenilins are aspartate proteases that become inactivated by mutating one of the two aspartic acid residues in the sixth or seventh transmembrane region respectively.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	473	 Overexpression of this mutant PS1 results in dominant negative effects on -secretase activity (Steiner et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	474	 The most simple explanation is that PS1 is -secretase itself.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	475	 This interpretation is consistent with the observation that deletion of the PS1 gene also results in the inhibition of -secretase (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	476	 In both experiments, secretion of ssA4(1-40) as well as ssA4(1-42) peptides was equally affected (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	477	 The subcellular localization of PS1 in the ER as we demonstrate here, is, however, difficult to reconcile with current concepts that -secretase processing of APP mainly occurs in the endocytic limb of the subcellular trafficking pathways.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	478	There is clearly a spatial paradox.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	479	 The first question to be addressed in this regard is whether the real substrates of -secretase, namely the - and ss-secretase cleaved APP carboxy-terminal stubs generally believed to be generated in the late biosynthetic compartments and the endocytic pathways, can indeed reach the subcellular compartments where PS1 resides.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	480	 Unexpectedly, we could demonstrate the enrichment of the APP carboxy-terminal stubs in the ER/IC subcellular fractions where PS1 resides.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	481	 From a cell biological point of view, it remains to be explained how this retrograde transport of the APP carboxy-terminal fragments to the ER/IC can occur and which sorting signals are involved, but this finding is at least consistent with the PS1 to -secretase hypothesis (Wolfe et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	482	 The second question is whether and how PS1 can affect the generation of amyloid peptide in the endocytic limb of the protein trafficking pathways in the cell.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	483	 This problem was addressed via a functional approach by expressing a series of APP trafficking mutants in hippocampal neurons using the recombinant SFV system.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	484	 In previous work, it has been extensively demonstrated that the processing and subcellular trafficking of APP expressed with this system does not differ from that observed with endogenously expressed APP (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	485	 Therefore, and in contrast with presenilins, the results obtained after transfection of APP with SFV under the experimental conditions used, can be considered as biologically relevant.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	486	The results (see Table 1) obtained with APP retained in the ER (APP/KK), with APP processed in the biosynthetic pathway (APPCT) or with APP retrieved in the endocytic pathway (APP/LDLR, not shown), corroborated the conclusion that presenilins operate in the ER/IC.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	487	 Significant increases in ssA4(1-42) secretion were observed with the APP/KK and to a lesser extent with the APPCT mutant in neurons expressing PS1M146L.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	488	 Such an effect was almost undetectable with the APP/LDL mutant.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	489	 The latter most likely reflects the inability of the APP/LDLR carboxy-terminal fragments generated by - or ss-secretase to be recycled to compartments where -secretase resides.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	490	 The APP/KK mutant was particular relevant in this regard.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	491	 The dilysine Golgi to ER retrieval signal is recognized by COPI subunits in proteins such as p58/ERGIC-53 and results in their retrograde retrieval from VTCs and cis-Golgi cisternae to the ER (Cosson and Letourneur 1994 ; Arar et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	492	 1996 ; Bannykh and Balch 1997 ).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	493	 The KK motif limits the trafficking of APP/KK to those compartments where also PS1 resides.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	494	 Indeed, the subcellular distribution of APP/KK was strikingly similar to that of endogenous PS1 (Figure 9).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	495	 As previously demonstrated, only very low amounts of amyloid peptide are recovered in the media with this construct (5% compared with wild-type APP).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	496	 Since ss-secretase is mainly operating beyond the ER/IC (Higaki et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	497	 1997 ), it is not surprising that only very small amounts of the immediate precursor of ssA4, i.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	498	, the ss-secretase cleaved carboxy-terminal APP fragment (Paganetti et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	499	 1998 ), are generated with APP/KK (Figure 9).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	500	 In contrast to the interpretation of Chyung et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	501	 1997 , we do not consider the residual ss-secretase activity as evidence for a novel, ER-linked ss-secretase activity.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	502	 Since >95% of the normal ss-secretase activity is precluded with this construct, this indicates in fact that ss-secretase is operating mainly beyond the cis-Golgi, and that APP/KK is only marginally processed by enzyme trailing in the cis-Golgi.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	503	 This interpretation is certainly more in line with general concepts of ss-secretase activity in other cell types since shown to depend on the activity of Rab1B (Dugan et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	504	 1995 ) and on O-glycosylation (Tomita et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	505	 In any event, the residual generation of ss-secretase cleaved fragments obtained with APP/KK was sufficient to demonstrate that mainly 1-42 peptide is generated in ER, IC, and early cis-Golgi, where the APP/KK carboxy-terminal stub is recycling.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	506	 More importantly, the presenilin mutants have a pronounced effect on this process, which is clearly consistent with their subcellular localization.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	507	On the other hand, 40-secretase processing in the endocytic pathways is not at all influenced by the PS1 mutations as was most dramatically illustrated with the APP/LDLR mutant.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	508	 The processing of this mutant, which selectively increases the production and secretion of the ss4A(1-40) peptide (this study), was not altered by coexpression of the PS1M146L.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	509	 It is generally accepted that the bulk of the ssA4(1-40) peptide is generated beyond the TGN (Cook et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	510	 1997 ) and in the endocytic pathways (Koo and Squazzo 1994 ; Perez et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	511	 1999 ) compartments where no PS1 is found (this study).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	512	 This explains why PS1 mutations have no major effects on the secretion of ssA4(1-40).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	513	 Further evidence for the selective effect of the presenilin mutations on -secretase cleavage at position 42 was obtained when coexpressing APP-London together with mutant PS1 (Borchelt et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	514	 Both clinical mutations increase the ssA4(1-42) secretion and act additively, which suggests independent or at least synergistic mechanisms operating with the two mutations.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	515	 The experimental evidence presented here together with many reports in the literature suggests strongly an exclusive role for the presenilins in 42-cleavage (as opposed to 40 cleavage).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	516	 The effect of the inactivation of PS1 (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	517	 1998 ) or the expression of dominant negative forms of PS1 (Wolfe et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	518	 1999 ) on 40-secretase activity must, therefore, be indirect.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	519	 One possibility is a precursor to product relationship between ssA4(1-42) and ssA4(1-40).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	520	 In this view, only one -secretase is needed that generates ssA4(1-42), whereas in compartments distal to the ER, carboxypeptidases convert this peptide to ssA4(1-40).
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	521	 This would explain the above-mentioned spatial paradox, but not completely the selective increased secretion of ssA4(1-42) linked to PS1 clinical mutations.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	522	 In a precursor to product relationship, one should also expect a rise in the secretion of ssA4(1-40), and this has not been really observed yet.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	523	 Along similar lines, the fact that the APP/LDLR or APPCT mutations that affect APP trafficking in the endocytic compartments have a direct effect on ssA4(1-40) production and secretion, support the general importance of this pathway in APP processing, and imply the existence of a 40-secretase activity in the endocytic limb.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	524	 Therefore, it is clear that further investigations are needed to explain the relationship between PS1 and 40-secretase activity.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	525	Unexpectedly, blocking the processing of APP in the endocytic pathway also decreases secretion of ssA4(1-42) (this study; Perez et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	526	 1999 ), whereas stimulating the endocytic recycling (APP/LDLR) selectively promotes ssA4(1-40) secretion.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	527	 A recent study provided evidence that the cytoplasmic tail of APP contains, in addition to endocytic signals, information that influences its metabolism in the exocytotic limb (Perez et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	528	Apart from the spatial paradox, it remains to be explained why mainly the immature, N-glycosylated form of APP holoprotein has been found to interact physically with PS1 (Weidemann et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	529	 One would predict a preferential association with the carboxy-terminal APP fragments if PS1 was indeed -secretase.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	530	 It could be speculated that PS1 is involved in a posttranslational modification of the newly synthesized APP, tagging it for later recognition by the -secretases, although any direct evidence supporting such a possibility is lacking.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	531	 Other hypotheses have been proposed as well.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	532	 PS1 might control trafficking of APP to its processing compartments, or alternatively, control trafficking of the -secretases to APP-bearing compartments.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	533	 For instance, the subtle effects on the maturation of TrkB and on BDNF-inducible TrkB autophosphorylation caused by PS1 deficiency in neurons was interpreted to reflect such a function (Naruse et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	534	 Our findings that endogenous PS1 colocalizes with marker proteins of the IC and ER, would agree with a recruiting or activating function for PS1, either as a chaperone or an adaptor molecule bringing -secretase, APP carboxy-terminal fragments, and maybe other substrates (De Strooper et al.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	535	 1999 ) together in the right subcellular microenvironment needed for the controlled and limited proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane domain.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	536	In conclusion, our data indicate clearly a direct role for PS1 in 42-secretase activity in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	537	 They are compatible with the hypothesis that PS1 is 42-secretase, and imply that 42-secretase exerts its activity in close association with transport processes between ER and the cis-Golgi.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	538	 However, some caution with this straightforward interpretation remains indicated, since several other observations remain difficult to integrate with this concept, most notoriously the relationship between PS1 deficiency and 40-secretase processing.
0.39283335.10525535.html.plaintext.txt	539	 Therefore, the alternative possibilities discussed above have to be further explored, and further research should clarify the exact molecular relationship between PS1 and 40- and 42-secretase activity.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Several lines of evidence have indicated that the presenilin proteins function within macromolecular complexes and are necessary for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of certain type 1 transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein, Notch, and p75.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Data from multiple complementary experiments now suggest that there may be several distinct presenilin complexes.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We show here that presenilin mutations and certain detergents affect the abundance and componentry of the presenilin complexes, and these structural effects correlate with their effects on -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Our data suggest that there are at least three complexes, including a 150-kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex (which is likely to be a precursor complex).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	7	 There is a stable and abundant intermediate complex of 440 kDa, which contains aph-1, pen-2, nicastrin, and PS1.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, it is the very low abundance, high mass (670 kDa) heteromeric complexes that are associated with the highest -secretase-specific activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   After their initial cloning as the site of mutations causing familial Alzheimer disease (1 to 3), numerous functional studies have shown that the presenilin proteins are necessary for an unusual form of proteolytic cleavage in which selected type 1 transmembrane proteins are cleaved within their hydrophobic transmembrane domains.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This form of regulated intramembranous proteolysis requires the presence of a complex of interacting membrane-bound proteins, including the presenilin proteins, aph-1 (4, 5), pen-2 (5), and nicastrin (6).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Others and we have previously suggested that although these proteins clearly physically interact with each other, they may in fact form more than a single complex (7 to 11).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We now report the results of several complementary experiments that directly support this notion and that show that functional -secretase activity mostly arises from a low-abundance, very high molecular weight complex (670 kDa).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These data continue to raise the possibility that either additional proteins may be present in these functional complexes or the functional complex is a higher order multimer of the presenilin, aph-1, pen-2, and nicastrin proteins.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These data also provide a partial structural explanation for the differential effects of detergents and certain mutations on -secretase activity.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	65	 To explore this, we undertook immunocytochemical studies of endogenous presenilin components in KNS glioma cells, mouse cerebellar granule neurons (not shown), and mouse cerebellar glial cells (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	66	 It was immediately apparent that although there is overlap between the distributions of these proteins, the degree of overlap is far from a perfect spatial co-registration (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These results hint either that there may be more than one type of complex formed by various different combinations of these proteins or that the complex components might be added to complexes in a spatially and temporally defined order.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The conclusion that there may not be a single "presenilin complex" would be in good agreement with previously published biochemical experiments, which had have shown that aph-1 and immature forms of nicastrin co-fractionate separately from PS1 and pen-2 on glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic fractionations (8, 9).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	69	 If nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, and the presenilins do indeed form more than a single type of complex, it immediately begs the question as to whether all of these complexes have -secretase activity.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Any two components showed partial overlap (A, bottom row), but all three components showed only modest overlap (B).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	73	  To begin to address these issues, we undertook detailed 2D gel electrophoresis studies using BN gel electrophoresis in the first dimension, followed by standard SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis in the second dimension.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	74	 When the initial cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish were prepared using 1% CHAPSO as the solubilizing detergent, at least two distinct PS1 immunoreactive spots were identified at 440 and 670 kDa, together with a smear pattern at even higher masses (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The 440- and 670-kDa complexes both contained maturely glycosylated nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, PS1-NTF, and PS1-CTF.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	76	 However, only the 670-kDa complex contained APP-CTFs.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	77	 These observations are unlikely to simply represent idiosyncrasies of the gel electrophoresis methodology because a broad distribution of complexes ranging from 150 to 670 kDa were also seen when these lysates were resolved on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Because the resolution of individual complexes is less robust on unidimensional glycerol velocity gradients, and because the glycerol velocity gradients resolve proteins according to relative buoyancy rather than by charge and mass as in gel electrophoretic separations, the predicted mass measurements are not identical between the 2D gel studies and the velocity gradients.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nevertheless, in general agreement with the result of the 2D gels, immature nicastrin and one of two peaks of aph-1 are enriched in lower molecular weight fractions at 100 to 200 kDa (Fig.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This result argues that the absence of -stub generation by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (B, right) is caused by the failure of digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes to dock -secretase substrates.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	99	  The 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is unlikely to subserve catalytic activity because it is present in PS1 to / to  cells, which do not support -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	100	 From these experiments alone, it is not possible to conclude which, if any, of the other higher mass complexes are associated with functional -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Attempts to measure the activity of specific complexes isolated from the 2D gels were not successful, presumably because of the low abundance of properly folded complexes being recovered.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	102	 To circumvent this problem, we elected to use three complementary strategies, which might, when taken together, indirectly infer which of these complexes were necessary for functional activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	103	 These three approaches were: 1) direct ascertainment of functional -secretase activity from glycerol velocity gradient fractions; 2) analysis of the differential effects of detergents on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size; and 3) analysis of the differential effects on PS1 mutations on -secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	104	To estimate the -secretase activity of these complexes, we used a cell-free assay (16) to investigate the generation of -stubs by anti-PS1 immunopurified membranes that were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO and that had then been resolved by size on the glycerol velocity gradients.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The highest specific -secretase activity relative to the amount of PS1-NTF in each fraction was found in the higher mass fractions ( > 500 kDa) of the glycerol velocity gradient (specific activity, 34.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	106	1 in fractions 9 to 10 and 11 to 12, respectively, compared with 12.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	107	63 in fractions 3 to 4 and 5 to 6, respectively, p  <  0.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	108	Previous in vitro studies have shown that CHAPSO is the optimum detergent for preserving -secretase activity in cell-free membrane preparations and that -secretase activity is significantly reduced by digitonin and completely abolished by Triton X-100, n-octyl glucoside, and many other detergents (18, 19).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	109	 When the glycerol velocity and 2D gel electrophoretic experiments were repeated using digitonin, there was a significant (100-fold) reduction in the abundance of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes on both the 2D gel electrophoreses (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	110	 2, right) and on the glycerol velocity fractionation experiments (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Furthermore, these fractions contain very little co-immunoprecipitating APP-CTFs and failed to generate significant quantities of -stubs in the cell-free -secretase assay (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	112	 To confirm that the absence of -secretase activity in digitonin-solubilized fractions was caused by failure of docking and cleavage of APP-CTFs by the digitonin-solubilized complexes (as opposed to artifacts such as simple degradation of APP-CTFs during the assay), we performed two additional experiments.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	113	 First, we immunopurified CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes, and split the product into two aliquots.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	114	 One aliquot was then submitted directly for -secretase assay, whereas digitonin was added to the other aliquot to a final concentration of 0.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	115	25%, and then submitted for -secretase assay.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	116	 No -stubs were generated by the aliquot containing digitonin (data not shown).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In the second experiment, we simply added additional purified APP-C99 to CHAPSO-solubilized and to digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Again, despite the abundant presence of substrate, the digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes failed to generate -stubs (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Taken together, these experiments suggest that digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes have undergone either a conformational shift and/or have lost a substrated adaptor protein.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	120	 When the presenilin complexes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 or in 1% n-octyl glucoside (neither of which support -secretase activity), the very high molecular weight presenilin complex species were essentially abolished and only monomeric species were found (data not shown).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	121	Functional -secretase activity is also modulated by selected mutations in the presenilin proteins.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	122	 In particular, mutation of either or both of the two aspartyl residues within membrane-embedded hydrophobic domains (PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A) have been associated with loss of proteolytic activity (20 to 22).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	123	 We therefore investigated the structure and relative abundance of presenilin complexes isolated from cells overexpressing either wild-type PS1 or the PS1 D385A loss-of-function mutant.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	124	 We have shown previously that the PS1 D385A mutation causes a reduction in the abundance of higher MW species on glycerol velocity gradient fractionation (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	125	 We have also shown that this reduction is not caused by the simple failure of endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Thus, high molecular weight complexes comparable in size with those of wild-type PS1-NTF/CTFs were observed in cells expressing the holoprotein of the PS1 Exon 9 deletion mutant (which causes increased 42-secretase activity but impaired PS1 endoproteolysis) (23).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In agreement with these prior observations, in the current 2D gel analyses, the PS1 D385A mutation was again associated with an altered distribution of complexes and components (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Thus, the 670-kDa complex was absent in digitonin-solubilized lysates of PS1 D385A-expressing cells, which displayed only the 440-kDa complex, and monomeric bands for nicastrin (110 kDa) and the PS1 D385A holoprotein (65 kDa) were observed (Fig 4A, right).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Similar but less profound changes in relative abundance of the 670- and 440-kDa complexes were also apparent after CHAPSO solubilization (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Thus, in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	131	 4, B, left, and C to F), there was greater abundance of the 670-kDa complex relative to the 440-kDa complexes (670 kDa/470 kDa ratio, 1.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	132	 However, in PS1 D385A overexpressing cells (Fig.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	133	 4, B, right, and C to F), there was a significant loss of the 670-kDa complex and a corresponding overabundance of the 440-kDa complex (670 kDa/440 kDa ratio, 0.

0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	141	 C to F, to confirm the results of direct visual interpretations, the intensity profiles of Western blotting signals were plotted using NIH Image software (solid line, wild-type PS1; dotted line, PS1 D385A).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Peak heights were then computed for the 440- and 670-kDa complexes, and these data were then used to compare the effects of detergents and PS1 mutations using the 670 kDa/440 kDa peak height ratio.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In wild-type PS1-expressing cells, the 670-kDa complex predominated, whereas in PS1 D385A mutant cells, the 440-kDa complex predominated (p  <  0.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	144	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The immunocytochemical data, the data from glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic separations, and the functional data arising from the differential effects of detergents and PS1 mutations cumulatively argue that there are several, authentic, independent complexes each with different molecular masses.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Although each of the techniques differs in the observed sizes of the complexes, their results are congruent, and it therefore seems very unlikely that these apparently distinct complexes are artifacts.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	146	 A more probable explanation is that the multiplicity of complexes relates to the maturation of the presenilin complex and to its functional regulation.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Based upon the fact that aph-1 is relatively stable in the absence of PS1 and binds to immature nicastrin, we have previously suggested that aph-1 is an initial scaffolding molecule upon which the functional complex is built (8).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This is supported by the fact that in PS1 to / to  cells, the 150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is stable and contains immature nicastrin, whereas the 440- and 670-kDa complexes are destabilized.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We now propose that the 440-kDa complex, which contains additional components (aph-1, PS1, nicastrin, and pen-2) but does not dock the APP-CTF substrate efficiently, is a relatively abundant but non-functional intermediary complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In support of this, the 440-kDa complex is stably present under conditions that are not associated with functional -secretase activity (i.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	151	 in the presence of digitonin or the PS1 D385A missense loss of function mutation).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The prevalence (albeit at low levels of abundance) of the high molecular weight 670-kDa complex under conditions associated with functional -secretase activity suggests that these complexes are the species that contain full enzymatic activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This is directly supported by the fact that the highest specific activity for -secretase activity is obtained in the glycerol velocity fractions containing complexes of  > 500 kDa.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	154	There are two potential explanations for our results.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The first and most straightforward explanation is that these complexes reflect the evolution of the presenilin complexes as they are assembled.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The lower mass (150 and 440 kDa) complexes might then represent initial and intermediary complexes, whereas the low abundance, high mass complexes (670 kDa) could represent functional complexes that contain either additional components or contain the four known components in a higher order stoichiometry (e.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Direct experiments analyzing the composition of these complexes will be required to resolve this possibility.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	158	 There are, however, two caveats to this hypothesis.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	159	 First, small, but measurable amounts of the 670-kDa complexes are still present in CHAPSO lysates of PS1 D385A cells (although these complexes are considerably reduced in abundance relative to the 440-kDa complexes).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This does not completely negate our hypothesis that the 670-kDa complexes are the functional conform because a substantial proportion of the PS1 D385A molecules are clearly in an aberrant conformational 440-kDa state in CHAPSO and nearly all of the PS1 D385A molecules are in the 400-kDa complex in digitonin.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	161	 As a result, it is probable that the PS1 D385A molecules in the 670-kDa complexes in CHAPSO do not have an entirely normal conform.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	162	 The second caveat concerning our postulated hierarchy of complexes arises from the observation that PS1 D385A-expressing cells do not assemble a robust nicastrin-aph-1 150-kDa complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It could be argued that the 150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex is not a precursor complex as we have postulated, but represents a downstream catabolic product of the 440- or 670-kDa complexes.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The stable presence of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 to / to  cells makes this hypothesis unlikely.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	165	 An alternate explanation for the disappearance of the 150-kDa complex in PS1 D385A cells, but not in PS1 to / to  cells, is that the 150-kDa complex could have a dual role.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This complex could be involved in presenting new nicastrin molecules to the 440-kDa complexes, and involved in recovering and re-presenting used nicastrin molecules back to the 440-kDa complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	167	 It is conceivable that in the presence of the PS1 D385A mutant, all available aph-1 might become locked-up in the PS1 D385A mutant 440-kDa complex, which fails to further mature, thereby causing disappearance of the 150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	168	A second observation of note in our results is the fact that the C-terminal fragments of APP arising from - and -secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein (which are the substrates for presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage) are not uniformly present in all of the presenilin complexes (see Figs.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In fact, the APP C-terminal stubs are most abundant in complexes associated with functional -secretase activity.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The increase in apparent molecular mass between the non-functional complexes and the functional complexes cannot be accounted for by the simple addition of one molecule of C-terminal APP stubs per complex (although we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple APP stubs are docked onto functional complexes).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	171	 However, the differential presence of APP-CTFs raises the intriguing and more plausible possibility that detergents and mutants associated with loss of -secretase activity have either: 1) altered the conformation and/or complex stoichiometry in a way that precludes efficient docking of substrates or 2) perturbed the binding of adapter molecules that might be required to allow substrate docking.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In keeping with this hypothesis, recent cross-competition assays with different classes of -secretase inhibitors has supported the notion that the substrate binding and catalytic sites of -secretase may be physically separate and that correct conformational shifts are required to bring bound-substrate into the catalytic site (24).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	173	In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the maturation and functional deployment of the presenilin proteins is more complex than has previously been thought.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Our data raise the possibility that additional components may exist in the high molecular mass functional complexes.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Our results also require a more detailed assessment as to whether all of the substrates that undergo presenilin dependent proteolysis are dependent on the same set of presenilin complexes or whether there are specialized complexes subserving cleavage of specific proteins.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	176	 For instance, it is conceivable that the complexes may differ in componentry according to their subcellular distribution (e.
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	177	 lipid-rich raft domains, plasma membrane, endosomal-lysosomal pathway, or autophagic vacuoles (25 to 29)).
0.3369568.15123598.html.plaintext.txt	178	 If this were the case, such site-specific composition of the complex might confer either substrate specificity or preferred proteolytic cleavage sites within transmembrane domains and might therefore be potentially exploited therapeutically.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	4	 These mutations alter the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by increasing the production of the fibrillogenic amyloid fragment, Ass1 to 42/43.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Since the secretase activities that process APP are localized in different intracellular compartments, it is likely that membrane transport is a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In this report we provide evidence for a direct connection between PS-1 and membrane transport.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We show that the N-terminus of PS-1 binds to rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (rabGDI), a regulatory factor in vesicle transport.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In PS-1-deficient neurons we found a 2-fold decrease in the amount of rabGDI associated with membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Our findings are compatible with PS-1 being a membrane receptor for rabGDI.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This is in line with a role of PS-1 in the regulation of protein trafficking in the ER/Golgi, which can modulate the production of Ass.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a common, devastating disorder of the brain, ultimately leading to death.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It is characterized by progressive memory loss and other cognitive and behavioral deficits.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Neuropathological characteristics include the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular ss-amyloid deposits in plaques and around cerebral blood vessels.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The sporadic form of the disease is the most common, but rare familial cases exist.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The first mutations identified in pedigrees with familial Alzheimer s disease (FAD) were found in the gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These mutations, however, account for only ~2% of the FAD cases and genetic linkage analysis eventually led to the identification of two other FAD genes, presenilin 1 (PS-1) and PS-2 (2,3).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	17	Presenilins (PSs) are integral membrane proteins with eight predicted transmembrane domains.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	18	 They are predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (4,5).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	19	 All PS mutations identified to date are missense mutations [except one (6)] and give rise to autosomal-dominant forms of AD.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The FAD mutations are randomly distributed throughout the protein; many of them are located in or adjacent to transmembrane regions.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Since the PS-1 knock-out phenotype is lethal and can be rescued by both wild-type and mutant PS-1 (7,8), the PS FAD mutations most likely result in a gain-of-(deleterious) function phenotype.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In spite of the strong homology between PS-1 and PS-2 (~65% amino acid identity) they are not functionally redundant.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Various reports suggest a role of PSs in Notch signaling, apoptosis or protein trafficking and sorting, but how these putative functions relate to the pathology of AD remains to be established (reviewed in ref.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	24	The most direct connection between AD and presenilins is the observation that all FAD mutations affect the distinct APP processing pathways, by an, as yet, unknown mechanism (10).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The constitutive -secretase pathway generates soluble sAPP fragments.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The -secretase activity is located at or very close to the plasma membrane (11 to 13) and cleaves APP within the amyloid region, thereby precluding the formation of ss-amyloid (Ass).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A second APP processing pathway involves a combined action of ss- and -secretase and leads to the formation of Ass fragments varying in length from 39 to 43 residues.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The subcellular localization of this amyloidogenic APP processing pathway appears to be cell-type specific.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In neuronal cells, cleavage by both ss- and -secretases occurs predominantly in the early secretory pathway (11,12).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In these cells, Ass1 to 42/43 is produced primarily in the ER and Ass1 to 40 in or beyond the Golgi apparatus (14,15).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The compartimentalization of the APP processing activities implies that correct trafficking of either APP or the secretases is pivotal for proper processing of APP, and that mistrafficking can lead to increased Ass production.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	32	 PS FAD mutations cause an increase in the formation of Ass, in particular of the more amyloidogenic 1 to 42/43 form (16,17).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, -secretase cleavage of APP is strongly inhibited in PS-1 to / to  mice, whereas - and ss-secretase cleavages are unaffected (18).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The localization of PS-1 in the ER/Golgi and the effect of PS FAD mutations and PS-1 deficiency on APP processing, are compatible with a role for PS-1 in protein sorting or trafficking in the cell.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	35	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The N-terminus of PS-1 binds to rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (rabGDI) To further define the functions of PS-1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system in order to identify PS-1 interacting proteins.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PS-1 (amino acids 1 to 80; Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	37	 1A) was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in vector pAS-2.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This fusion construct was used to screen a human adult brain cDNA library cloned downstream of the Gal4 activation domain of the two-hybrid prey plasmid pACT2.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	39	 One of the putative PS-1 interacting proteins we identified in this screen encoded the C-terminal part of rabGDI (amino acids 205 to 447), which includes the conserved regions 3A and B (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Figure 1C shows the result of a two-hybrid assay with PS-1 and this C-terminal part of rabGDI.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	41	 RabGDI interacts with the N-terminus of PS-1, not with the pAS-2 vector without insert and also not with another part of PS-1, HL-VI, a large hydrophilic loop that, like the N-terminus, is oriented towards the cytoplasm (Fig.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	52	 RabGDI does not interact with the pAS2-1 vector (vector) or with another part of PS-1, HL-VI (A).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	53	 A positive control of two unrelated interacting proteins is included.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The lower panel shows a two-hybrid experiment with the N-terminus of PS-1 and rabGDIss.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The region from SCR 3A through the termination codon (amino acids 204 to 445), which is homologous to the part of rabGDI that was identified in the two-hybrid screen with PS-1, was used (A).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	56	  RabGDI binds to members of the rab family of monomeric GTPases (19).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	57	 GTP-bound rab proteins are associated with the cytoplasmic surface of transport vesicles and are thought to regulate membrane fusion through the interaction of their effector proteins with components of the conserved SNARE membrane fusion complex.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Upon GTP hydrolysis, rabGDI binds to rab proteins in their GDP-bound form, extracts them into the cytoplasm and subsequently serves to deliver rab GDP to a donor organelle.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This cyclical mechanism allows rab proteins to engage in multiple rounds of vesicular transport between two compartments and it is thought that rabGDI improves the fidelity of transport (20,21).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	60	RabGDIs constitute a small family of highly conserved proteins.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In yeast a single essential rabGDI is present (22), but in higher species two or more isoforms have been identified.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	62	 RabGDIs bind rab proteins with similar selectivity (23,24).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The intracellular localization of rabGDI isoforms, however, appears to be different, providing yet another level of specificity in trafficking (23,25 to 27).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Two human rabGDI isoforms have been cloned thus far: the ubiquitously expressed rabGDIss and the brain-specific rabGDI that was identified in our screen with the PS-1 N-terminus (28,29).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The two rabGDIs are highly homologous, even the least conserved C-terminal region that we found to bind PS-1 displays 80% identity at the amino acid level, suggesting that they have similar functions.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	66	 In support of this notion, and shown in Figure 1C, the rabGDIss isoform can also bind PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	67	Endogenous full-length rabGDI binds the PS-1 N-terminus To confirm and extend the two-hybrid result, we next investigated whether endogenous rabGDI can also bind PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Therefore, we expressed the PS-1 N-terminus as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli and incubated this tagged protein with mouse brain homogenate.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In the absence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPS, we did not observe binding of rabGDI to the PS-1 fusion protein, as shown in Figure 2.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In contrast, GTPS pre-incubation of the brain extract at 37 degrees C for 30 min resulted in formation of a complex between rabGDI and the PS-1 fusion protein (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	71	 2) as detected with a rabGDI antibody cross-reacting with the ~55 kDa rabGDI mouse homolog, rabGDI1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Possibly, stabilization of rab proteins in their GTP-bound conformation enhances the interaction between GDI and PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Some rabGDI binding to the GST protein alone was seen, but this was only a minor fraction compared with the GDI bound to the PS-1 to GST fusion protein.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, the presence of a PS-1 N-terminus on a GST fusion protein strongly increases binding of endogenous rabGDI to the fusion protein.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The increased association in the presence of GTPS suggests that binding is facilitated when rabGDI is not complexed with rab proteins.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Endogenous rabGDI binds to the PS-1 N-terminus.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The position of rabGDI as detected by a polyclonal rabGDI antibody is indicated.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	80	  RabGDI binds to endogenous PS-1 We next wanted to investigate whether rabGDI can also interact with endogenous PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	81	 We had to circumvent the use of a secondary antibody for detection of co-precipitated proteins, because the GDI and PS-1 bands co-migrate with the IgG bands, which interferes with the detection.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	82	 We therefore used transfected 293 cells with an HA-tagged rabGDI construct, which allows detection with an HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	83	 We preferred not to use overexpression of PS-1, since this may introduce artefacts (30).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	84	 When we analyzed proteins co-precipitating with the endogenous PS-1 from the 293 cells, we could identify the HA-rabGDI; however, the signal was very low (data not shown).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	85	 To increase the amount of PS-1 in the immunoprecipitation we incubated a detergent lysate from mouse brain membranes with a lysate from rabGDI transfected cells.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	86	 After pre-incubation with GTPS, PS-1 protein complexes were immuno precipitated with an antibody directed to the PS-1 N-terminus, and analyzed with the HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This approach did indeed increase the amount of HA-rabGDI that is precipitated with the PS-1 antibody, indicating that the amount of precipitated HA-rabGDI is proportional to the level of PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The PS-1 antibody co-precipitates HA-rabGDI from the transfected 293 lysate, but not from the mock-transfected 293 lysate (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This is not due to a non-specific interaction of rabGDI with the PS-1 antibody or the protein A beads, since no HA-rabGDI was immuno precipitated if a 14-3-3 polyclonal antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation (data not shown).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This result confirms that rabGDI binds endogenous PS-1.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Co-immunoprecipitation of transfected rabGDI with endogenous PS-1 from mouse neuronal membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Membranes from mouse brain were solubilized and incubated with lysates from 293 cells that were mock transfected or transfected with HA-tagged rabGDI and immunoprecipitation was performed with an N-terminal PS-1 antibody.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The position of the transfected rabGDI as detected by the HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody is indicated.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	96	  RabGDI and PS-1 localize to the same compartment In order to interact in the context of an intact cell, rabGDI and PS-1 have to be present at the same location in the cell.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	97	 We therefore analyzed the subcellular localization of rabGDI in primary mouse hippocampal neurons.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In biochemical analysis, the great majority of rabGDI is found in the cytosolic fraction (25).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	99	 However, studies on the localization of rabGDI in situ by immunofluoresence showed that in MDCK cells more rabGDI is either associated with or located in close proximity to membranous structures in the cell than the fractionation studies suggest, as may be expected for a membrane-associated protein (31).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	100	 We observed that rabGDI in neurons is localized in a reticular, perinuclear pattern with some punctate staining in the neurites as well, suggesting that rabGDI is primarily localized in the vicinity of the ER (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	101	 To confirm this we performed double labelings with the rabGDI antibody and the ER-resident enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Although the staining of PDI (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	103	 4B) is somewhat more confined to the perinuclear region than rabGDI, there is strong overlap between PDI and rabGDI localization (Fig.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	110	  RabGDI membrane association is impaired in PS-1-deficient neurons In contrast to the well established role of rabGDI in the rab cycle, little is known about the proteins involved in recruiting the rabGDI/rabGDP to a membrane and how GDI is dissociated when the rab protein is inserted in a membrane.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Since PS-1 is an integral membrane protein that interacts in a cytosolic domain with rabGDI, we tested whether PS-1 acts as a membrane receptor for rabGDI.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	112	 To this end, we prepared a total membrane fraction from neuronal cultures derived from wild-type or PS-1 knock-out mouse embryos and assayed the amount of rabGDI associated with these membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	113	 To control for the amount of membranes loaded, the rabGDI values were corrected for the amount of calnexin, which is, like PS-1, an integral membrane protein in the ER.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	114	 As shown in Figure 5, a 2-fold decrease in membrane-associated rabGDI (51.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	115	7% compared with wild-type) was observed in the PS-1-deficient cells.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This is not due to a difference in expression of rabGDI in these brain cultures, since the total amount of rabGDI is the same for wild-type and knock-out cells (data not shown).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	117	 We also did not observe a difference in the cytosolic fractions of wild-type or knock-out cells.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	118	 It is, however, not surprising that the difference in the membrane fraction is not reflected in the cytosolic fraction.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Given the fact that the majority of rabGDI ends up in the cytosolic fraction after fractionation, this pool is too large to show this.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This result suggests that PS-1 is involved in the membrane association of rabGDI in mouse brain.

0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	129	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In this paper we report that PS-1 binds to a regulator of vesicle transport, rabGDI.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	130	 As PS-1 is localized to ER/Golgi compartments, it is tempting to postulate a role for PS-1 in protein trafficking.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This is supported by studies in which deletion of PS-1 or its Caenorhabditis elegans homolog affect sorting/maturation of proteins such as the TrkB receptor (32) and the Notch receptor (33).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	132	 In addition, the transport of ss-catenin to the nucleus is disturbed in PS-1 FAD mutants (34).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Recent findings indicate that cleavage of the Notch receptor is inhibited in the absence of PS-1 and that mutation of conserved membrane aspartates in PS-1 inhibits -secretase cleavage (35 to 38).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	134	 These data link PS-1 to -secretase cleavage; however, they do not provide conclusive evidence since the collective data can also be explained by protein mis-targeting (39).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This is an attractive explanation, since PS-1 is localized in the ER/Golgi, whereas Notch cleavage occurs at the plasma membrane.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Alterations in protein trafficking have been hypothesized to be important in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Since Ass is produced in the ER/Golgi, increased trafficking of APP or the -secretases to these compartments may increase Ass formation.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Our data show that PS-1 binds rabGDI and we propose that this interaction is required for normal vesicular transport through the biosynthetic pathway.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The observation that rabGDI, like PS-1, localizes to the ER makes it likely that this interaction can occur in the context of an intact cell.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	140	 In agreement with this, APP processing is also affected by perturbation of rab1B and rab6 function (40,41).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	141	Membrane receptors for rabGDI have been postulated on endocytic compartments (42 to 45).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Our finding that the membrane association of rabGDI is decreased in the absence of PS-1 (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	143	 4) leads us to propose that PS-1 might be such a receptor for rabGDI on ER/Golgi membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Although we cannot exclude that the reduced amount of rabGDI at the membranes is a secondary effect caused by the developmental defects of the PS-1 defeciency, the finding that PS-1 and rabGDI can physically interact supports the hypothesis that the PS-1 deficiency directly affects the amount of rabGDI on the membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Since there will be several receptors for GDI in the cell, it is not surprising that, although a significant decrease of GDI in the membrane fraction is observed in the absence of PS-1, there is still GDI associated with membranes.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Possibly, PS-1 sequesters rabGDI in the ER/Golgi complex, thereby allowing GDI to function between or in these compartments.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The binding of rabGDI to PS-1 is increased in the presence of GTPS, suggesting that GDI binds when it is not complexed with rab proteins (Fig.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	148	 This could mean that the binding of a rabGDI/rab complex to PS-1 allows dissociation of this complex, thereby delivering the rab protein to the membrane.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Alternatively, PS-1 may sequester rabGDI to the membrane, so that it can bind rab proteins that have hydrolyzed their GTP.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The binding of the rab protein may then release rabGDI from PS-1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Interestingly, a recent paper reports the binding of the trans-Golgi network rab11 to another part of the PS-1 protein, HLVI, which suggests that PS-1 may also be in direct contact with rab proteins (46).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	152	How could an FAD mutation in PS-1 affect the function of rabGDI? The FAD mutations show a dominant gain-of-function phenotype.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This could imply that rabGDI binds with higher affinity to mutant PS-1 or that it is not properly released.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Either way this would affect the normal function of rabGDI in the ER/Golgi complex, where PS-1 is localized.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In this respect it is interesting that the amount of rab8 associated with membranes is increased in the brain of AD patients, suggesting either increased delivery or decreased release of rab proteins from membranes (47).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Preliminary data from our laboratory that the membrane association of rab6 is decreased in PS-1 to / to  cells would be in agreement with this (W.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	157	 In vitro, addition of rabGDI to ER/Golgi membranes releases rab proteins from membranes, thereby inhibiting ER/Golgi transport (48).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Recently, very potent inhibitory rabGDI mutants were described with limited ability to extract rab1A from membranes (49).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Since these mutant rabGDI proteins efficiently bind to membranes, it was suggested that the inhibition of transport was caused by altered affinity of rabGDI for a membrane receptor, thereby blocking normal rabGDI activity.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Since the PS-1 FAD mutations only increase the production of Ass 1.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	161	5- to 2-fold, any effect of an FAD mutation on the interaction with rabGDI will be very subtle.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	162	 It can be expected that mutations in the N-terminus of PS-1 would directly interfere with rabGDI binding.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Whereas FAD mutations occur throughout the PS-1 protein, to our knowledge, no FAD mutations were described in the N-terminus, except one immediately adjacent to the first transmembrane domain (9).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This is consistent with our model since mutations that prevent binding of rabGDI would lead to loss of function of PS-1 and thus not to an FAD phenotype.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The level of rabGDI in neuronal cells is several times higher than in non-neuronal cells (28,29).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This may explain a neuron-specific effect of the putative rabGDI to PS-1 interaction.
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	167	 A role for rabGDI in maintenance of neuronal function is supported by the recent identification of mutations in rabGDI in X-linked non-specific mental retardation (50).
0.42100945.10607841.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Our data suggest that rabGDI may play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of AD as well.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	4	 OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Recent studies demonstrate that presenilins (PSs) and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are members of a novel protease family of integral membrane proteins that may utilize a catalytic mechanism similar to classic aspartic proteases such as pepsin, renin and cathepsin D.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The defining features of the PSs and SPP are their ability to cleave substrate polypeptides within a transmembrane region, the presence of two active site aspartate residues in adjacent membrane-spanning regions and a conserved PAL motif near their COOH-terminus.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	6	 PSs appear to be the catalytic subunit of multiprotein complexes that possess -secretase activity.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Because this activity generates the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) deposited in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), PSs are considered therapeutic targets in AD.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In contrast to PSs that are not active unless part of a larger complex, SPP does not appear to require protein co-factors.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Because of its requirement for hepatitis C virus maturation and a possible immune modulatory role, SPP is also considered a potential therapeutic target.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Four additional PS/SPP homologs have been identified in humans; yet, their functions have not been elucidated.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Herein, we will review the recent advances in our understanding of the PS/SPP family of proteases as well as discuss aspects of intramembrane cleavage that are not well understood.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	13	 OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   In order to more accurately reflect their catalytic activities, proteases have been referred to as peptide peptidohydrolases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This terminology reflects the catalytic mechanism in which a water molecule plays an essential role in cleaving a peptide bond.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Until recently, all characterized  classic  proteases had been shown to have an active site domain located in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasmic, lumenal or extracellular space.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus, cleavage of peptide bonds buried within the hydrophobic interior of a cellular membrane was postulated to require either breakdown of the membrane or transport of substrate out of the lipid bilayer to an aqueous environment.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The recent identification of several families of membrane proteases that seem capable of cleaving peptide bonds present within the lipid bilayer has dramatically changed the concept of how transmembrane regions of proteins may be cleaved (1,2).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	18	Three families of proteases that carry out  intramembrane proteolysis  are recognized (1,2).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Though exact catalytic mechanisms remain elusive, there is evidence that the active site of these proteases could lie within the plane of the lipid bilayer, and that proteases within each family may utilize conserved catalytic mechanisms analogous to those found in classic proteases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The first family, whose prototypic member is the human site-two protease (S2P) that cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), appears to be a group of metalloproteases (3).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The second family, the rhomboids, whose prototypic member Drosophila Rhomboid-1 cleaves and liberates several EGF ligands, appears to be a group of serine proteases (4).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A third family, whose prototypic members are the presenilins (PSs) involved in cleavage of the amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and Notch, appears to be a group of aspartic proteases (5,6).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Collectively these proteases have been referred to as intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	24	 For several reasons a great deal of attention has focused on the aspartic I-CLiP family.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	25	 First, the prototypic members of this family, the human PSs, are therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Second, a new member of this family, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), was recently identified and shown unequivocally to possess proteolytic activity and have biological functions that may also make it a therapeutic target.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	29	 OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   PSs are integral membrane proteins with 6 to 8 predicted transmembrane regions.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	30	 They were first identified through genetic linkage analysis in families with early onset autosomal dominant forms of AD (7,8).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	31	 PSs are synthesized as 50 kDa proteins, but are rapidly endoproteolyzed into NH2- (30 kDa) and COOH- (20 kDa) terminal fragments, which remain associated along with other proteins in a high molecular weight complex (9,10).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	32	 To date, 100 AD-linked mutations have been found in presenilin 1 (PS1) and several more in presenilin 2 (PS2) (11).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Almost concurrent with the identification of mutations in PSs as genetic causes of AD, there was some evidence linking PSs to the proteolytic activity referred to as -secretase (12).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This activity is involved in the production of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) from its precursor, APP.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Following cleavage of APP by ss-secretase, -secretase cleaves the membrane bound COOH-terminal APP fragment within its transmembrane region generating both the 4 kDa Ass peptide and a cognate COOH-terminal cleavage product.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The cut in the membrane is heterogeneous with multiple Ass species produced ranging in length from 32 to 42 amino acids (13).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The most prevalent form of Ass is one of 40 amino acid residues (Ass40); under typical circumstances Ass40 represents  > 50% of the Ass secreted from a cell.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, an Ass species of 42 amino acids (Ass42) appears to play a causal role in AD pathogenesis.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	39	 To date, all AD-linked mutations in PS1 and PS2 have been shown to increase the relative production of Ass42 even in asymptomatic carriers, and expression of a mutant PS gene in transgenic mice overexpressing human APP, accelerated accumulation and aggregation of Ass in the brain (12,14).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	40	Despite the evidence that mutations in PSs altered the -secretase activity that generated Ass, no one readily endorsed the idea that PSs were -secretases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	41	 PSs did not bear homology to classic proteases; thus, it was proposed that PSs influenced -secretase activity indirectly.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Over the past few years, genetic and biochemical evidence has emerged demonstrating that PSs are in fact -secretases.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Knockout studies of PS1 and PS2 demonstrated an essential role of these proteins in -secretase cleavage.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	44	 PS1 knockout decreased -secretase activity by 80%, a PS2 knockout had little or no effect, and a combined PS1 and PS2 knockout abolished -secretase activity (15 to 18).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Biochemical studies showed that PS1 co-fractionates with -secretase activity in a high molecular weight complex and this in vitro activity could be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (19).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Significantly, mutation of conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) present in two adjacent transmembrane regions produced dominant negative forms of PS that inhibited -secretase activity in cells (5).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These studies together with inhibitor studies suggested that PSs might be aspartic type proteases (20).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Finally, inhibitors of -secretase activity have been shown to directly target both PS1 and PS2 (21 to 24).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogs of aspartic proteases (21,22), it certainly appears that despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartic proteases, PS may be just that.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	50	Recent insight into the other components of the high molecular weight complex that contains -secretase activity and PSs, now offers a more complete picture of -secretase.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Three additional proteins are required for -secretase activity in cells.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Nicastrin (Nct, APH-2) is a 130 kDa type I membrane protein that was originally purified from the complex (25).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Two additional proteins, APH-1, another integral membrane protein of 30 kDa with multiple transmembrane regions, and PEN-2, a small hairpin like protein of 12 kDa, were initially isolated from genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans (26).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Together with a PS, the three components appear to comprise a minimal functional -secretase complex (27 to 29).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Although the precise function of each subunit is not yet definitively established, it appears that PSs are the catalytic component, and that Nct, APH-1 and PEN-2 play various roles in the stabilization and maturation of the complex.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	56	 It is also possible that these  accessory  proteins are involved in substrate presentation.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	57	The biological activities of -secretase and PSs have been extensively reviewed (2,30).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Although some activities of PSs are distinct from their protease activity (e.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	60	 -Secretase activity regulates Notch and APP signaling by promoting the release of the cytoplasmic tail from a membrane bound fragment of each precursor.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It is not clear whether the release of small peptides, such as Ass, into the exoplasmic space has any demonstrable physiologic function.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	66	 OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   The second, more recently identified member of the aspartic I-CLiP family is the SPP of higher eukaryotes (31).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Typical for an aspartic I-CLiP, SPP is a predicted multispanning membrane protein containing two putative active site aspartates that are located in the centre of adjacent transmembrane regions.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The latter feature is consistent with the observed cleavage of substrate peptides in the centre of their membrane-spanning portion.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, SPP contains two endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans and an ER retrieval signal, KKxx, ascribing SPP a function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (31).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	70	The role of SPP in cell function is poorly understood.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The SPP substrates identified to date, represent a variety of signal peptides and a viral protein (Table 2) (31 to 34).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	72	 They do not unequivocally demonstrate to a role of SPP either in the degradation of signal peptides that may otherwise accumulate in the ER membrane, or in the activation of signaling or regulatory molecules, or both.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Potential orthologs of SPP are found in the genomes of animals and plants but not fungi and bacteria (31,35).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Therefore, the prime role of SPP may not necessarily be the clearance of membranes from signal peptides, which are produced in all organisms, and a more basic mechanism may exist to fulfil that function.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	75	 We may thus speculate that SPP, in analogy to other I-CLiPs, may promote the liberation of bioactive peptides or proteins from the ER membrane.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The generation of HLA-E epitopes in humans represents the first example of such an SPP-dependent production of a bioactive peptide, which in this case functions as a reporter.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The epitopes are eventually presented at the cell surface of most of our cells, where they are recognized by the natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Presentation of these signal peptide-derived epitopes is an indirect indication that the probed cell is healthy and had properly synthesized MHC class I molecules.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The finding that SPP is exploited by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the processing of the viral core protein, implies that the protease may also catalyse intramembrane cleavage of membrane anchored proteins, similar to other I-CLiPs (34).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	84	 During biosynthesis of viral proteins in HCV infected cells, the immature HCV core protein is transiently anchored in the ER membrane via a COOH-terminal, signal peptide-like sequence.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Intramembrane proteolysis by SPP promotes the final processing of core protein and its release from the ER membrane into the cytosol.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Likewise, we may speculate that proteins anchored in the ER membrane by a signal peptide-like sequence, may be liberated from the ER membrane and activated upon cleavage by SPP.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	88	 OTHER HOMOLOGS MODELS OF CLEAVAGE CONCLUSIONS REFERENCES   Despite limited areas of direct sequence homology, PSs and SPP are membrane proteins whose sequences can be aligned almost throughout their entire lengths (31,35).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	89	 PSs and SPP share identical active site motifs, YD and LGLGD (Table 3).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In addition, they contain a third conserved region, PAL, which seems characteristic for the entire aspartic I-CLiP family.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Moreover, the YD and LGLGD motifs, which contain the catalytic aspartate residues, are unusual in that they are present within predicted adjacent and opposing transmembrane regions.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The similarities between PSs and SPP, particularly the identity of the active site motifs, point to a common catalytic mechanism.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Indeed, a series of protease inhibitors including aspartic protease transition state analogues, targeted to the active site of SPP and PSs, inhibited both activities (38).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Because both enzymes are potential targets for therapeutic intervention PSs for the treatment of AD and SPP for the anti HCV therapy it will be a challenging task for the future to define compounds and conditions for the selective inhibition of either protease.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	95	 PS and PSH family members   Another common feature, and one that is typical of many I-CLiPs, is that both PS and SPP activity appear to require prior cleavage of the substrate to remove its ectodomain.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	96	 SPP substrates are first cleaved by signal peptidase (33), whereas PS/-secretase substrates are first cleaved by shedding proteases (e.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	97	 ADAM family members and ss-secretase) (39 to 41).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In most cases studied to date, this initial cleavage is essential for the intramembrane cut to occur.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Thus, substrate specificity of PS/-secretase and SPP may be determined as much by this priming cleavage as the respective substrate sequence itself.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	100	One of the most striking differences between PSs and SPP is the apparent opposite positioning of the active site motif-containing transmembrane regions within the plane of the membrane (31,42).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This positioning correlates with the opposite orientation of the respective substrates.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	102	 PS substrates have a type I membrane topology with their COOH-termini facing the cytosol, whereas SPP substrates have a type II topology with their NH2-termini facing the cytosol.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Thus, it appears that related proteases with inversed proteolytic domains evolved for the cleavage of membrane spanning peptides of different topologies.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	104	Despite the common features, there are major differences between PSs and SPP.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The reconstitution of human SPP in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not express an orthologous  signal peptide peptidase , suggested that human SPP does not require additional proteins for activity (31).
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	106	 In contrast, PSs appear to require at least three additional protein partners for activity.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	107	 PSs undergo endoproteolytic activation, which may depend on these components and, together with these additional proteins, forms an active -secretase complex.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Such activation and complex formation may provide means of control of the protease's intramembrane-cleaving activity, and regulate substrate delivery and/or trafficking to the intracellular site of action.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In the case of SPP, there is no indication for endoproteolysis or any another activation step.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Nevertheless, its activity is almost certainly regulated in some fashion; SPP does not appear to randomly attack membrane proteins in the ER.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Rather than the protease activity, properties of the substrates may account for controlled proteolysis by SPP (33).

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	120	 PSH/SPPLs are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with multiple membrane spanning regions, and to contain both the conserved transmembrane aspartates in the motifs YD and LGhGD, and the PAL motif near the COOH-terminus.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In addition, several members of the family contain a protease-associated domain near their NH2-terminus.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The conservation of putative active site motifs between I-CLiPs and classic proteases indicates that the catalytic mechanism of I-CLiPs most likely involves hydrolysis.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	126	 If this is the case, then water must somehow gain entry into the active site of these proteases and the labile bonds within the substrate's transmembrane region must at some point be exposed to an activated water molecule.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	127	 In Figure 1, theoretical models that might fulfill these two requirements are shown.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This model is compatible with I-CLiP cleavage sites that lie close to the cytosolic or lumenal face of the membrane, such as those that release the cytoplasmic tail of APP and Notch.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, cleavage events such as those that generate Ass and appear to occur in the middle of the membrane, might either require some perpendicular movement of the substrate or protease within the membrane, or possibly a very deep hydrophilic pocket.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	131	 A variant of this model might be that the transmembrane regions of the I-CLiP adopt a horseshoe like structure.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Upon association of the substrate to the active site, a channel or pore might be formed allowing access of water to the site of hydrolysis.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Such a model might require distinct initial binding sites of the substrate followed by transfer into the active site.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	134	 1B), that might be suggested by recent data showing that both PSs and SPP may form dimers in vivo, is one in which the initial binding of substrate occurs in one active site.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	135	 This binding could then induce a conformational shift resulting in the merger of the two subunits that together form a pore like structure.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Alternatively, a distinct substrate-binding site on one subunit could result in presentation of the substrate to the active site of the other subunit.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Additional models of cleavage that combine various aspects of these models are possible.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Finally, it is possible that a given I-CLiP may utilize a novel mechanism of catalysis that is compatible with cleavage of a peptide bond in a lipid environment.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	142	 (A) An I-CLiP may form a shallow or deep hydrophilic pocket in the membrane.

0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The pocket may form upon a conformational change induced by binding of the substrate.
0.48230362.12966028.html.plaintext.txt	145	 (B) Two units of an I-CLiP may act as a dimer to carry out the cleavage.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are responsible for the majority of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 PS, a critical component of -secretase, is responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and Notch.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Other physiological functions have been assigned to PS without any clear identification of the mechanisms underlying these multiple biological roles.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The early embryonic lethality of PS1 and PS2 double knock-out (PS1/2 null) mice prevents the evaluation of physiological roles of PS.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To investigate new functions for presenilins, we performed a proteomic approach by using cells derived from PS1/2 null blastocysts and wild type controls.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We identified a presenilin-dependent cell-surface binding of albumin.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Binding of albumin depends on intact caveolae on the cellular surface.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Abnormal caveolin 1 localization in PS1/2 null cells was associated with a loss of caveolae and an absence of caveolin 1 expression within lipid rafts.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Expressing PS1 or PS2 but not the intracellular form of Notch1 in PS1/2 null cells restored normal caveolin 1 localization, demonstrating that presenilins are required for the subcellular trafficking of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Despite an expression of both caveolin 1 and PS1 within lipid raft-enriched fractions after sucrose density centrifugation in wild type cells, no direct interaction between these two proteins was detected, implying that presenilins affect caveolin 1 trafficking in an indirect manner.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We conclude that presenilins are required for caveolae formation by controlling transport of intracellular caveolin 1 to the plasma membrane.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   -Secretase activity is responsible for the cleavage of the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 releasing the amyloid peptide A and the APP intracellular domain.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A is a major component of amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Presenilins (PSs) are the active core of -secretase (1, 2).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Different molecular components of the -secretase complex were identified and include, in addition to PSs, Nicastrin, Aph1, and Pen-2 (3).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	19	The PS-dependent proteolytic process is involved in the release of the cytoplasmic domains of an increasing range of type I integral membrane receptors such as Notch (4 to 6), ErbB-4 (7), E-cadherin (8), and others.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	20	 PSs, in addition to their role as -secretase catalytic subunits, have an important function in subcellular trafficking of a selected group of proteins such as APP, Trk receptor (9), Nicastrin (10), and Pen-2 (11).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	21	PSs mediate additional physiological functions, including roles in calcium homeostasis, neurite outgrowth, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity (12).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Because deleting ps1 and ps2 genes in mice leads to an early embryonic lethality (13), the role of presenilins cannot be fully examined in double knock-out mice.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	23	Therefore, we used cells derived from PS1 and PS2 double null (termed PS1/2 null) blastocysts and their WT controls (14) to perform a differential proteomic approach.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We identified a presenilin-dependent defect in albumin binding reflecting an abnormal caveolae-dependent pathway.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	25	 We showed that caveolin 1 was mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells leading to abnormal caveolae formation and an absence of caveolin1 in lipid rafts.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Overexpression of PSs in PS1/2 null cells was sufficient to restore normal caveolin localization and function.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	27	 We could not detect any physical interaction between presenilins and caveolin 1.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These results imply that presenilins are responsible, in an indirect manner, for caveolin 1 transport to the cell surface to form caveolae.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Caveolae-mediated endocytosis in endothelial cells is stimulated by the binding of albumin to a specific albumin-binding protein localized in caveolae (17).

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	122	To ensure that the defect in caveolae-dependent endocytosis observed in PS1/2 null cells was specifically because of a lack of PS proteins, we examined whether the transient expression of the presenilin cDNA was sufficient to restore albumin binding in PS1/2 null cells.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	124	 The presence of BSA was detected on Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels of either SV40-transformed blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (top) or blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells (bottom) overexpressing PS1.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	125	 We confirmed this result by restoring efficient FITC-albumin uptake in blastocyst-derived PS1/2 null cells expressing either PS1 (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	126	 These results show that caveolae functionality is dependent upon either PS1 or PS2 expression.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	127	Because the phenotype observed in PS1/2 null cells (Figs.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	128	 1, 2, 3) is reminiscent to the one observed in caveolin1-deficient cells (16), we wondered if caveolin 1 was expressed in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	129	 By Western blotting, we were able to detect caveolin 1 expression in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	130	2 We decided to further investigate how caveolin1 was regulated in PS1/2 null cells in comparison to WT cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	131	 We employed the following three distinct methods to address this issue.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	132	 We first explored caveolin1 localization by immunofluorescence.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	133	 We then observed caveolae formation by EM.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Finally, we looked at the association of caveolin 1 with lipid rafts by sucrose density centrifugation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	135	In order to evaluate caveolin 1 (Cav1) distribution between WT and PS1/2 null cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In most of WT cells, endogenous caveolin 1 was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane with typical caveolae-associated punctated staining (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	137	 4A, I), whereas in PS1/2 null cells, endogenous caveolin 1 showed pronounced punctated perinuclear localization (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Altered localization of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells was also observed after forced expression of GFP-Cav1 (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	139	 4A, IV) and with endogenous caveolin 2.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	140	2 This result shows that there is an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	141	 To evaluate if caveolin 1 membrane localization was PS-dependent, we examined if transient expression of presenilin 2 cDNA was sufficient to induce a change in caveolin 1 localization.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	142	 4B, transient expression of FLAG-presenilin 2 (V) in PS1/2 null cells induced redistribution of endogenous caveolin 1 from its perinuclear localization (VI).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Micro-injection of PS1 cDNA in GFP-Cav1 positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	144	 4B, VII) allowed GFP-Cav1 to be relocalized as in WT cells (VIII).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	145	 In contrast, no noticeable changes in GFP-Cav1 localization was observed after the microinjection of the Notch NICD (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	146	 4B, IX) construct in GFP-Cav1-positive PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	147	 These results show that caveolin 1 is mislocalized in PS1/2 null cells and that even though most of the PS1/2 null mice phenotypes are attributable to a loss of Notch 1 function (13), presenilins are involved in the subcellular localization of caveolin 1 independently from Notch activity.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	148	Expression of caveolin 1 in cells lacking caveolae causes de novo formation of caveolae, whereas ablation or mislocalization of caveolin 1 expression causes a loss of caveolae (18 to 20).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	149	 We wondered if PS1/2 null cells showing mislocalized caveolin 1 were still able to form caveolae.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Caveolae are well defined organelles, forming flask-shaped necks at the plasma membrane easily distinguishable by electron microscopy.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The presence of caveolae in PS1/2 null cells was investigated by EM.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	152	 We found a marked reduced number of caveolae at the plasma membrane of presenilin-deficient cells (Fig.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition, only 20% of PS1/2 null cells showed caveolae at the plasma membrane compared with 100% of WT cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	155	2 These data show that presenilins are involved in caveolae formation.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Caveolae are isolated by their insolubility in Triton X-100 and their sedimentation in low density fractions over sucrose gradients (21).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We performed isolation of CEM of WT and PS1/2 null cell proteins (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	163	 It has been shown previously that caveolae-enriched fractions isolated in this manner exclude markers for caveolae membranes such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum (22, 23).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Distribution of BIP and -adaptin, non-raft proteins localized in the ER and the trans-Golgi, respectively, was also examined to monitor the contamination of CEM with ER and trans-Golgi membranes (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Flotillins have been described as a new family of proteins associated with caveolae (24).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	166	 6A), flotillin 1 expression was restricted to fractions 4 and 5 (CEM), implying that extraction with Triton X-100 yielded good separation of lipid rafts from BIP and -adaptin not detected in CEM fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Caveolin 1 expression was not restricted to CEM and was also found in other fractions in WT cells.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	168	 As shown previously (25 to 27), PS1 was also concentrated in raft fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Caveolin 1 expression was detected in fraction 5 in WT cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	170	 6A) but not in PS1/2 null cells (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In PS1/2 null cells, caveolin 1 was only present in fraction 7 and in high density fractions (fractions 9 to 12) with Triton X-100-soluble proteins.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	172	 This result shows that in the absence of presenilins, caveolin 1 was not detected in the low density fractions normally enriched in caveolae (fractions 4 and 5), further supporting the fact that caveolae do not form.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Most surprisingly, flotillin 1 expression was no longer associated with lipid rafts in PS1/2 null cells, implying that not only caveolae but also other lipid rafts may be affected by a deficiency in presenilins expression.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Non-raft proteins resident in the ER (BIP) and the trans-Golgi (ada, -adaptin) are recovered in heavier fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	180	  In order to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for caveolin 1 mislocalization in PS1/2 null cells, we tested if presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 were able to interact with one another.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Despite a co-expression of caveolin 1 and PS1 in lipid rafts (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	182	 6A), we were not able to detect any interaction between endogenous presenilin 1 and caveolin 1 by immunoprecipitation in WT cells2 either from total extract or from CEM fractions.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	183	Altogether these results show that PS1 or PS2 expression is required for a correct localization of caveolin 1 in caveolae at the plasma membrane but that the absence of presenilins may affect other protein(s) directly implicated in caveolin 1 sorting.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	184	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   In this paper we performed a differential proteomic approach using blastocyst-derived WT and PS1/2 null cells in order to identify new roles of presenilins beyond Alzheimer's disease.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	185	 By using this approach, we identified a presenilin-dependent caveolin 1 localization leading to an absence of caveolae when presenilins are missing.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Caveolin 1 can be now added to the list of proteins with a presenilin-dependent trafficking.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	187	We observed an intracellular retention of caveolin 1 in PS1/2 null cells (Fig.

0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	189	2 In these experiments, caveolin 1 was more broadly distributed than -adaptin.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The precise localization of caveolin 1 in the absence of presenilins needs further investigation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	191	The mechanism by which presenilins, such as chaperone proteins, will allow the correct caveolin 1 localization and caveolae formation does not involve a complex between caveolin 1 and presenilin and is independent from Notch 1 signaling (Fig.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Flotillin 1 always targets to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions independent of the presence of caveolin (28).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Thus, the absence of flotillin 1 from lipid raft fractions in PS1/2 null cells is not because of caveolin 1 mislocalization, implying that the mechanism by which presenilins transport raft proteins to lipid rafts is more global and may directly affect a common protein involved in the targeting of raft-associated proteins to lipid rafts.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Lipid rafts are multifunctional organelles playing important roles in a variety of cellular processes, and in this work, we pointed to an important new role for presenilins.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	195	Neurons do not form caveolae but form lipid rafts with caveolae-type structures.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	196	 APP was found in membrane fractions with caveolae-like properties (29), suggesting that caveolae-type structures might be important in the manifestation of AD.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Moreover, targeting -secretase to lipid rafts was shown to up-regulate -site processing of APP (30), and presenilins were found highly enriched in caveolin-3-positive caveolae in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques (31).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Recently, -secretase complex was shown to be localized in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes (32).
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	199	 We can thus postulate that in neurons, presenilins may be implicated in the trafficking of proteins such as flotillin 1, which is responsible for lipid raft formation.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	200	 These lipid rafts would form the best environment for -secretase activity.
0.37812415.15613480.html.plaintext.txt	201	 A better understanding of how -secretase complex is formed and transported to the cell membrane may lead to the development of new pharmacological strategies to specifically target the cleavage of APP and delay the progress of AD.

0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to identify an interacting armadillo protein, termed p0071, that binds specifically to the hydrophilic loop of presenilin 1.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	6	 In vivo, the presenilins constitutively undergo proteolytic processing, forming two stable fragments.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here, we show that the C-terminal fragment of presenilin 1 directly binds to p0071.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Nine out of 10 armadillo repeats in p0071 are essential for mediating this interaction.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Since armadillo proteins, like -catenin and APC, are known to participate in cellular signaling, p0071 may function as a mediator of presenilin 1 in signaling events.

0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	11	Mutations in the two presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) are the most common cause of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (for review, see Ref.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Encoded by genes on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, PS1 and PS2 are highly homologous proteins predicted to contain eight transmembrane helices (2, 3).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Immunocytochemical analysis has shown that PS1 is localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and, to a lesser extent, in the Golgi compartment (4, 5).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	14	 More than 40 missense mutations have been identified in PS1 (6, 7), and these mutations account for up to 60% of early-onset cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (8).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Many of these mutations occur within transmembrane domains or immediately adjacent to the predicted hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (9).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A large family from Colombia has a E280A mutation in the hydrophilic loop of PS1; affected individuals show massive deposits of A42 peptide in many brain regions (10).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The mutant gene products of PS1 and PS2 cause dysfunction and/or death of vulnerable populations of nerve cells, with the resulting clinical syndrome of progressive dementia.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	18	To examine the in vivo role of PS1 in mammalian development, mice with a targeted disruption of the PS1 gene were generated (11, 12).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Homozygous mutant mice failed to survive beyond the first 10 min after birth.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The most striking phenotype observed in PS1 null embryos was a severe perturbation in the development of the axial skeleton and ribs.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The failed development of the axial skeleton in PS1 null mutants was traced to defects in somitogenesis; at embryonic days 8.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	22	5, somites were irregularly shaped and misaligned along the entire length of the neural tube and largely absent in the most caudal regions.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The abnormal somite patterns in PS1 null embryos are highly reminiscent of somite segmentation defects in mice with functionally inactivated notch-1 and dll-1 genes (13, 14).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Indeed, the expression of mRNA that encodes Notch-1 and Dll-1 is strongly reduced in the presomitic mesoderm of PS1 null mice (12).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	25	This raises the possibility that the presenilins play an important role in Notch signaling during embryonic development and/or cellular differentiation.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In support of this notion, Sel-12, the presenilin homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans, functions as a co-receptor for the nematode notch receptor, Lin-12 (15), and a misfunction of the sel-12 gene causes constitutive activation of lin-12, resulting in an egg-lying defect (15).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	27	 How these functions contribute to the pathological properties of mutant presenilins in Alzheimer's disease remains to be determined.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	28	To elucidate the normal biological role of the presenilins, efforts have been made to identify molecules that interact with the presenilins.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In three recent reports (16-18), PS1 was shown to interact with different members of the catenin family of proteins, termed - and -catenin.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Pathogenic mutations in the PS1 gene reduced the ability of PS1 to stabilize -catenin and caused an increased degradation of -catenin in the brains of transgenic mice (17).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	31	The catenins are mammalian homologs of the Drosophila armadillo protein predicted to participate in the Wingless signaling pathway.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The Notch and Wingless signaling pathways have been described to be mutually inhibitory and are functionally associated with the protein called Dishevelled (19).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Interestingly, the human homolog of Dishevelled has been mapped to a region of chromosome 3 that has recently been linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (6, 20).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	34	We have now used yeast two-hybrid screens to identify molecules that bind to the hydrophilic loop of PS1.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A single interacting protein was discovered, termed p0071, identical to a recently reported novel member of the armadillo family (21).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The p0071 sequence covers three distinct domains: the N- and C-terminal domains lack significant homology to other known proteins, whereas the central domain represents a stretch of 10 armadillo repeat domains with strong homology to -catenin, p120, and B6P/plakophilin-1 (18, 21).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The interaction of PS1 with p0071 was confirmed by three independent methods, i.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	38	 yeast two-hybrid retransformation assays, binding to GST1 fusion proteins, and immunoprecipitation from brain and cotransfected COS cells.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal fragment of PS1 constitutively formed by proteolytic processing under in vivo conditions (22).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Neither the hydrophilic N or C terminus of PS1 nor the loop of PS2 shows an interaction with p0071.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Nine out of 10 armadillo repeat domains in p0071 are essential for mediating this interaction, consistent with the paradigm that individual motifs or couples of these motifs function as protein modules in signaling cascades establishing protein-protein interactions (23).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	42	Our studies provide compelling evidence that a novel member of the armadillo family, termed p0071, interacts in a specific manner with PS1.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In contrast to the recently reported armadillo protein -catenin, which interacts with PS1 and shows a brain-specific expression pattern (18), p0071 and -catenin are broadly expressed in a variety of tissues (1, 21), fitting well with the widespread expression of PS1 (24).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, it seems that differential interactions modulated in a tissue- or developmental stage-specific manner may be the molecular basis for the different functions of the normal and mutant forms of the presenilins.

0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	224	The presenilins PS1 and PS2 are the major genes responsible for early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (1).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The aim of this study was to find interacting proteins for PS1 because most cellular functions of proteins are mediated by protein-protein interactions.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Thus, the identification of interacting molecules helps us to understand the biological function of a protein.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for the hydrophilic loop of PS1, located between transmembrane domains 6 and 7.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	228	 In this screen, we identified a recently discovered novel member of the armadillo family, termed p0071 (21), that interacts in a specific manner with PS1.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	229	 We confirmed the interaction by three independent methods, i.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	230	 yeast two-hybrid retransformation assays, binding to GST fusion proteins, and immunoprecipitations from human brain and transfected COS cells.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	231	As mentioned, p0071 belongs to a protein family named after the Drosophila segment polarity gene armadillo, which is involved in inductive signaling events during development (35).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	232	 The members of the armadillo family are characterized by a series of imperfect 42-amino acid repeats (36).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	233	 Based on the modular composition of the armadillo family members, it was suggested that individual motifs or couples of these motifs function in signaling cascades establishing protein-protein interactions (23).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Therefore, we were interested in determining the binding motif in p0071.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	235	Using the yeast two-hybrid method, we could demonstrate that armadillo repeats 2-10 are necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction with PS1 (Fig.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	236	 As recently reported, -catenin interacts with conductin via its armadillo repeats 3-7 (37).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Thus, the interactions mediated by p0071 or -catenin support the above-mentioned paradigm of how armadillo proteins mediate protein-protein interactions.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	238	The armadillo family members /-catenin and p0071 show a high degree of amino acid identity in the armadillo repeat domain located in the middle of the respective molecules.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	239	 For instance, p0071 and -catenin are 69.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	240	2% identical in their armadillo repeat domains.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	241	 This high degree of identity in the domains mediating protein-protein interactions predicts that the respective binding partners are similar or even identical.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Thus, it is not surprising that /-catenin can also interact with PS1 (16-18).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	243	The question now arises as to what the biological significance is of multiple interacting molecules.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Most likely, the interactions of PS1 with different members of the armadillo family may be a function of the cell type or the developmental stage of an organism.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In support of this hypothesis, -catenin shows an almost brain-specific expression pattern (18), whereas p0071 and -catenin are widely expressed in all tissues (1, 21), reminiscent of the PS1 expression pattern (24).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	246	A direct interaction of PS1 with members of the armadillo family has a number of implications.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	247	 -Catenin and its Drosophila homolog armadillo are multifunctional proteins: both are key components of cell-cell adhesive junctions and also participate in transduction of Wingless-Wnt cell-cell signals.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Wingless-Wnt signals direct many key developmental decisions, regulating anterior-posterior pattern in flies and vertebrates.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	249	 -Catenin/armadillo is a key effector of signal transduction.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In the absence of signals, levels of free -catenin/armadillo are low: the Wingless-Wnt signal stabilizes free -catenin/armadillo.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Stabilized -catenin binds to a transcription factor of the Tcf-Lef family and enters the nucleus, inducing expression of genes involved in proliferation or apoptosis (38).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	252	The high degree of similarity between the armadillo family members implies that p0071 acts in a similar manner.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Indeed, p0071 contains a nuclear targeting signal (KKKKKKKR) within its armadillo repeat domain.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Thus, it is tempting to speculate that p0071, in concert with a transcription factor, enters the nucleus and alters gene expression.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The function of PS1 might be to form a complex with p0071 in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi compartment and to control its targeting and/or proteolytic degradation.
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	256	 The targeted disruption of the PS1 gene in mice strongly reduces the expression of Notch-1 in the presomitic mesoderm (12).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	257	 In addition, the abnormal somite patterns in PS1 null embryos are highly reminiscent of somite segmentation defects described in mice with a functionally inactivated notch-1 gene (13).
0.36363396.10092585.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Thus, the members of the armadillo family might be mediators of PS1 function in signaling cascades.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	6	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endoproteolytically processed by BACE1 and -secretase to release amyloid peptides (Ass40 and 42) that aggregate to form senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The C-terminus of Ass40/42 is generated by -secretase, whose activity is dependent upon presenilin (PS 1 or 2).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Missense mutations in PS1 (and PS2) occur in patients with early-onset familial AD (FAD), and previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cell models demonstrated that FAD-PS1 variants shift the ratio of Ass40 : 42 to favor Ass42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	9	 One hypothesis to explain this outcome is that mutant PS alters the specificity of -secretase to favor production of Ass42 at the expense of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	10	 To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied Ass40 and 42 levels in a series of transgenic mice that co-express the Swedish mutation of APP (APPswe) with two FAD-PS1 variants that differentially accelerate amyloid pathology in the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We demonstrate a direct correlation between the concentration of Ass42 and the rate of amyloid deposition.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We further show that the shift in Ass42 : 40 ratios associated with the expression of FAD-PS1 variants is due to a specific elevation in the steady-state levels of Ass42, while maintaining a constant level of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These data suggest that PS1 variants do not simply alter the preferred cleavage site for -secretase, but rather that they have more complex effects on the regulation of -secretase and its access to substrates.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   The pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid lesions formed by aggregated peptides (ss-amyloid, Ass), which are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through endoproteolytic cleavage by BACE1 and -secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	15	 APP is also a substrate for other endoproteases (-secretase and BACE2), and collectively these cleavages generate a range of amyloid (Ass) peptides (for review see 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The most pathogenic of these peptides, Ass40 and 42, share a common N-terminus (+1) and differ by two residues at their C-terminus (2 to 7).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Mutations in APP identified from familial AD (FAD) kindreds alter the protein's normal processing, causing either increased production of both peptides or a specific elevation in Ass42 (8 to 11).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The longer Ass42 peptide is more prone than Ass40 to aggregate in vitro (12,13), and is the major species detected immunocytochemically in the brains of AD patients (14).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	19	Mutations in two additional genes, presenilin 1 (PS1) and its homolog PS2, also cause early-onset FAD (15 to 17).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates suggest that PS1 and PS2 are components of a larger protein complex that contains nicastrin, Aph-1, and PEN-2 (18 to 27).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This complex is either a required cofactor for, or is itself, the -secretase activity that generates the C-termini of Ass40 and 42 (19,22 to 24,28 to 35).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Deletion of both PS1 and PS2 leads to a complete loss of -secretase activity (33).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Cells deficient in PS1 also show abnormalities in the subcellular trafficking of integral membrane proteins, including APP (36,37).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	24	An interaction between the presenilins and APP was first suggested by the observation that the plasma of patients with mutations in PS1 had higher ratios of Ass42 relative to Ass40 than patients with sporadic AD (38).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Subsequent work in cell models demonstrated that co-expression of FAD-mutant PS1 with APP reproduced the rise in Ass42 relative to Ass40 that had been seen in patients with PS1-associated AD (39 to 41).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	26	 This shift in Ass40 : Ass42 ratio was also found in the brains of transgenic mice co-expressing one of several FAD PS1 mutations (M146V, M146L, A246E or M286L) with the Swedish mutation of APP (39,42 to 44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Similar shifts in the steady-state ratios of mouse Ass40 : Ass42 were also noted in mice expressing only FAD-variant PS1 (45) or PS2 (46).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Transgenic mice co-expressing mutated PS1 and APP developed amyloid pathology much earlier than mice expressing only APP; the acceleration in amyloid formation directly correlated with the change in the Ass40 : Ass42 ratios (42,47,48).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In contrast, co-expression of wild-type human PS1 with mutant human APP had no impact on the rate of amyloid formation (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	30	Studies of dominant negative versions of PS1 and chemical inhibitors of -secretase have been interpreted as evidence that PS1 may comprise the active site of the -secretase complex (28,31,49 to 52).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Moreover, because some of these inhibitors coordinately depress both Ass40 and Ass42 production, it has been assumed that one enzyme complex is responsible for the production of both peptides (50,51).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In such a setting, FAD mutations in PS1 might alter the ratio of Ass peptides produced from APP simply by shifting the specificity of -secretase to favor cleavage at residue 42 over that at 40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In this scenario, mutations that increase the output of Ass42 should be accompanied by a decrease in the generation of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	34	In the current work, we took advantage of recent advances in ELISA methodology to examine Ass40 and Ass42 levels in several lines of APPswe mice co-expressing either of two FAD PS1 variants (A246E and dE9).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Each PS1 variant accelerated the rate of amyloid deposition to differing extents.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	36	 After quantifying the levels of Ass40 and Ass42 in the brains of young, pre-symptomatic animals, we found that co-expression of either PS1A246E or PS1-dE9 in APPswe transgenic mice specifically increased Ass42 levels without altering Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	37	 From these data, we defined a direct correlation between the age of amyloid onset and Ass42 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Based on work from cultured cell models suggesting that mutant PS1 alters the production of Ass42 (39 to 41), we conclude that changes in the steady-state level of this peptide in our transgenic mice were most likely due to alterations in the processing of APP.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We suggest that FAD-PS1 variants may increase the accessibility of BACE1-cleaved C-terminal fragments of APP (ss-CTFs) to a -secretase that preferentially cleaves at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	40	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   Transgene-derived APPswe expression in lines Q2-2, 85 and C3-3 In this study, we used three different lines of mice that express Mo/HuAPP695swe under control of the mouse prion protein promoter (53).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The Mo/Hu APP695swe construct encodes mouse sequence throughout the extra- and intracellular regions, human sequence within the Ass domain, and Swedish mutations K594N/M595L just prior to the Ass N-terminus.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Lines Q2-2 and C3-3 harbor only the APPswe construct and have been previously characterized (53).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The third line of APPswe mice used for this study, line 85, expresses an identical Mo/Hu APPswe construct in conjunction with the exon-9-deleted variant of human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) (54).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This line was produced by co-injection of the APPswe and PS1-dE9 vectors, each controlled by its own prion promoter element, following previously reported procedures (55).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	45	Immunoblot analysis of brain protein separated by SDS to PAGE demonstrated relatively high levels of APPswe expression in each of these lines (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Blots probed with monoclonal antibody 22C11, which detects a shared epitope in the N-terminal region of mouse and human APP, showed that each of the transgenic lines expresses 2- to 4-fold more total APP than non-transgenic animals (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Immunoblots probed with monoclonal antibody 6E10, which detects the humanized Ass domain of our transgene product, demonstrated that APPswe protein levels were highest in the brains of mice from line C3-3; overall expression in the three lines ranked Q2-2 < 85 < C3-3 (Fig.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	51	 (B) Antibody 22C11 was used to detect endogenous mouse APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP-2) (80) in non-transgenic controls and both endogenous APP/APLP-2 and transgene-derived human APPswe in lines Q2-2, 85 and C3-3.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Immunoblot analysis consistently revealed the highest APPswe expression in line C3-3, the lowest in line Q2-2, with Line 85 falling between the two lines.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	53	  PS1-A246E and PS1-dE9 possess different amyloidogenic potentials In previous studies we (44,47) and others (42,43,48) have shown that the co-expression mutant PS1 with APPswe can accelerate the rate of amyloid deposition.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	54	 By contrast, co-expression of wild-type human PS1, even at very high levels, has no effect on the rate of amyloid deposition (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Here we extend this work to compare the effects of two FAD PS1 variants which hasten amyloid onset to differing degrees.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	56	 As shown previously (47), transgenic mice from line C3-3 do not develop amyloid deposits until well beyond 18 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Co-expression of PS1-A246E (line N-5) halves this time, with C3-3/N-5 mice developing amyloid deposits by 9 to 12 months (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Plaque burden in the C3-3/N-5 mice worsens with age, and by 20 to 24 months the hippocampus and cortex show high amyloid burdens.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	59	 A similar acceleration in amyloid deposition has been noted when mice from a different line of PS1-A246E (line I2-4) are crossed to C3-3 mice (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	60	 When mice from line C3-3 are crossed with mice expressing the exon-9-deleted variant of PS1 (line S-9) (56), substantial amyloid deposition is visible by 6 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	61	 As with PS1-A246E, amyloid burdens in the C3-3/PS1-dE9 mice increase throughout life (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The early appearance of amyloid deposits was observed in offspring of C3-3 mice mated with two different lines of PS1-dE9 mice (line S-9 shown here and line O-7, data not shown), confirming that the effect was due to the PS1-dE9 transgene and not to an artifact of integration site.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	69	 (G to I) Co-expression of PS1-dE9 in line C3-3 APPswe mice further hastens the appearance of pathology.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The hippocampus is shown in all panels for ease of comparison; plaques are also observed in superficial layers of the anterior cortex concurrent with hippocampal onset.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	72	  Measurements of Ass levels by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the N-terminus of Ass followed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the 40 or 42 termini demonstrated that the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42 varied by genotype (Fig.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	80	 As reported in a previous work (39), co-expression of PS1A246E halves the Ass40 : Ass42 ratio to 1.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Here we show that expressing PS1dE9 in the C3-3 APPswe mice alters Ass levels so dramatically that Ass42 becomes the dominant species.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t-test.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	84	  Further evidence of the highly pathogenic activity of PS1-dE9 was seen when we extended our study to mice that express lower levels of APPswe.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Mice from line Q2-2 do not develop amyloid pathology until after 20 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	86	 To test whether co-expression of mutant PS1 could induce plaques in this non-depositing line, we crossed Q2-2 APPswe mice with animals expressing either PS1-A246E (line I2-4) (44,56) or PS1-dE9 (line S-9) (56,57).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Despite its ability to accelerate amyloid deposition in line C3-3 mice (44), co-expression of PS1-A246E in line Q2-2 produced no amyloid pathology in any brain region through 20 months of age (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In contrast, double transgenic offspring from Q2-2xPS1-dE9 developed substantial amyloid pathology by mid-life (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Deposits probably began at 15 to 18 months; by the time they were sacrificed at 20 months, animals had a considerable burden of both diffuse and compact plaques throughout the hippocampus and cortex.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Thus, PS1-dE9 consistently induces earlier pathology in APPswe transgenic mice than PS1-A246E, and is pathogenic enough to cause amyloid formation even in a line of APPswe animals that would otherwise have remained free of deposits.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	101	  Analysis of the double-transgenic mice, created by co-injecting Mo/Hu APPswe and PS1-dE9 constructs, again confirmed the amyloidogenic potential of the PS1-dE9 variant.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Animals from line 85 express levels of APPswe intermediate to lines C3-3 and Q2-2 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	103	 1); however, because they invariably co-express PS1dE9, line 85 mice develop amyloid deposits far earlier than either single transgenic APPswe line (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Occasional deposits can be found in line 85 mice as young as 6 months of age, and by 9 months most animals have a significant plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Thus the dE9 variant appears to be a highly pathogenic mutation, with profound effects on the deposition of amyloid peptides.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Despite its highly pathogenic activity, expression of PS1-dE9 alone in mice is not sufficient to induce amyloid deposits from endogenous mouse APP (not shown), consistent with previous reports of other FAD variant PS1 transgenic mice (48).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	107	Mutant PS1 specifically increases the steady-state levels of Ass42 By two independent approaches, we have demonstrated that the earlier appearance of amyloid in mice co-expressing APPswe (line C3-3) with PS1-A246E (line N-5) or PS1-dE9 (line S-9) is associated with a change in the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42 to favor Ass42 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In both of these studies, however, variance in the efficiency of Ass peptide captured by either immunoprecipitation or ELISA made it difficult to distinguish whether Ass42 levels were increased at the expense of Ass40, or whether the level of Ass42 increased independently while Ass40 remained unchanged.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In the course of our study, a refined ELISA approach (58) was developed that allowed us to address this issue.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	110	Using the refined ELISA assay, we studied the levels of Ass peptides in the brains of young, pre-deposit animals from each of the double transgenic lines described above (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Tissue was processed using a two-step extraction method: following sonication in 0.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The two fractions were assayed separately; data for total Ass were calculated by addition of the DEA and FA fraction values obtained for each animal.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	114	 We noted that approximately 50% of Ass40 was extracted by DEA, while a lower, and more variable, percentage of Ass42 was extracted by this solvent (Table 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Because all of the samples were prepared from young, pre-deposit animals, especially in the case of the mice transgenic for only APPswe, we do not believe that the relative insolubility of Ass42 was due to oligomerization of this peptide, but rather to an inherent difference in the solubility of the two peptides in DEA.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Our comparisons across genotypes in each transgenic series therefore focus on total Ass values rather than DEA- or FA-soluble fractions to accommodate the differential solubility of the two peptides.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Values for Ass40 and 42 in each genotype were normalized to the levels in C3-3 single transgenic mice, so that the value of each peptide in the C3-3 mice is set to 1, and the values for Ass40 and 42 in other genotypes are related to C3-3 mice (see Table 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Statistical significance among genotypes was calculated pair-wise using a two-tailed Student's t-test (pairs noted by brackets on figure).

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Co-expression of Hu PS1dE9 induces the greatest relative increase in Ass42 and the largest decrease in age of amyloid onset.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Note that the onset of amyloid lesions for line Q2-2 is estimated from the age at which plaques appear in Q2-2xPS1dE9 animals, and would be difficult to observe in the normal mouse lifespan.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	129	 (C) The levels of Ass40 and 42 in the brains of Q2-2 APPswe mice crossed to PS1 mice were measured in a separate ELISA assay.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	130	 The concentration of each peptide was normalized to the value measured in Q2-2 single transgenic mice (set to 1).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	131	 As in the C3-3 series, the co-expression of PS1A246E and PS1dE9 in the Q2-2 mice significantly elevated the level of Ass42 without decreasing that of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The asterisk denotes a small but significant difference in Ass40 found between Q2-2xPS1-A246E and Q2-2.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	133	 None of the remaining pairs showed significant differences in Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Normalized fractions of brain Ass extracted into DEA and formic acid   Two separate series of experiments were performed.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In one series we compared Ass40 and Ass42 levels in the brains of C3-3 APPswe mice with the levels in C3-3xPS1-A246E, C3-3xPS1-dE9, APPswe/PS1dE9 line 85 and Q2-2 mice (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In the first series, all values were normalized to Ass levels in the C3-3 mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Graphing the relative levels of each peptide in these animals revealed that the addition of mutant PS1 increases the concentration of Ass42 without causing a proportionate decrease in Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The case for this conclusion is stronger in the second series of mice described below, but even in the C3-3 series our measurements show that, compared with APPswe single transgenic mice, co-expression of PS1A246E caused a 50% increase, and PS1-dE9 a 150% increase, in the concentration of Ass42 without consistently lowering the level of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	139	 In mice co-expressing the PS1dE9 variant with APPswe, the levels of Ass42 exceeded that of Ass40 (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	140	 3), hence it is difficult to argue that the lack of change in Ass40 levels might be due to a far greater abundance of Ass40 relative to Ass42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	141	Comparison of these values with the ages at which amyloid deposits first appear in each genotype suggests an immediate relationship (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The age of onset in each cross directly correlates with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This correlation extends beyond the C3-3 series.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Line 85 mice, made by co-injecting APPswe and PS1dE9 vectors, were very similar to C3-3xPS1-dE9 mice in both their peptide levels and in their age of amyloid onset (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	145	 At the other end of this spectrum, Q2-2 single transgenic mice accumulate even less Ass42 than C3-3 single transgenic mice, and show no sign of amyloid pathology at ages when deposits have already begun in C3-3 animals (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	146	In the second ELISA experiment, we measured Ass levels across the Q2-2 APPswe series (Q2-2; Q2-2xPS1-A246E; and Q2-2xPS1-dE9).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The concentrations of Ass values for each genotype were normalized to levels in the Q2-2 single transgenic animals.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Again, we found that the addition of mutant PS1 specifically elevates Ass42 levels without lowering Ass40 levels (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Collectively these data demonstrate that when mutant PS1 is present, then there is a specific increase in Ass42 without a proportionate decrease in Ass40.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	163	 By comparing Ass measurements in APPswe/PS1-dE9 double transgenic mice to animals expressing APPswe, alone or with the less pathogenic PS1-A246E mutation, we have gained insight into the mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 cause early-onset AD.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Our data show that FAD variants of PS1 selectively increase the levels of Ass42 without affecting Ass40 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Thus, co-expression of PS1 variants increases the amount of total Ass derived from a constant level of APPswe protein, suggesting that mutant PS1, either directly or indirectly, makes more substrate available for -processing, and that this additional substrate is specifically cleaved at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	166	 We further demonstrate that small changes in the levels of Ass42 can have considerable impact on the rate of amyloid deposition, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit that might be gained by lowering Ass42 levels, even partially, early in the clinical course of AD.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	167	Amyloid onset is determined by the level of Ass42 In previous studies, we (44,47) and others (42,43,48) have demonstrated that the co-expression of FAD-associated PS1 variants in APP transgenic mice shifts the ratio of Ass40 : Ass42, and that this shift correlates with a more rapid appearance of amyloid deposits.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	168	 In contrast, the co-expression of wild-type human PS1 has no impact on the rate of amyloid formation (44).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	169	 All previous studies have been two-point comparisons between one line of mice expressing mutant APP mice and mice expressing one FAD-PS1 variant.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	170	 The present study is the first to analyze different combinations of APP and PS1 variants that show distinct courses of amyloid pathology.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Our data demonstrate that the age at which amyloid deposits first appear correlates directly with the concentration of Ass42 in the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	172	 As demonstrated in mice from line Q2-2, not all animals over-expressing APP, nor even those co-expressing PS1, will form amyloid deposits in their 2-year lifetime.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	173	 While co-expression of PS1-A246E was able to dramatically accelerate the appearance of plaques in C3-3 APPswe transgenic mice, its effect was not strong enough to induce plaques by 20 months of age in the lower-expressing Q2-2 APPswe mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Instead, plaques were only observed in mice from line Q2-2 when the highly pathogenic PS1-dE9 variant was introduced.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Quantitative ELISA analysis in mice from each genotype revealed that both PS1 variants altered the concentration of Ass42 in the brain: animals expressing either PS1 variant contained more Ass42 than Q2-2 single transgenic mice.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, co-expression of PS1-dE9 led to substantially higher Ass42 levels than did PS1-A246E, consistent with its ability to induce amyloid formation earlier than PS1-A246E.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	177	Studies of Ass40 and Ass42 fibrilization in vitro have demonstrated that the formation of congophilic fibrils follows second-order kinetics, where there is a long lag phase (the nucleation and seeding phase) followed by an exponential phase of fibril formation until extinction of the substrate (12,13,65,66).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Since the length of the lag phase is proportional to the concentration of Ass peptides (12,13,65,66), we believe that the different rates of Ass deposition observed in each genotype represent changes in the rate of nucleation and seeding of Ass42 fibrils in vivo.

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In these unusual cases, Ass aggregates have been described as  cotton wool  deposits because they lack compact dense cores and do not show birefringence when stained with Congo Red (59 to 63).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However such atypical pathology has not been found in all PS1-dE9 kindreds (62,64).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Indeed, mice carrying the PS1dE9 mutation do not recapitulate the cotton wool plaques of the dE9 FAD patients.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Instead, all lines of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice examined in this study develop congophilic, neuritic, senile plaques (Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Perhaps the extreme concentrations of Ass needed to observe amyloid formation within the mouse lifespan artificially drive plaques into the compact form.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	185	The second atypical feature of FAD caused by the PS1-dE9 mutation is the frequent appearance of spastic paraparesis (59,61,67).

0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The incomplete penetrance of atypical pathology and motor dysfunction in the PS1-dE9 kindreds, and the lack of such features in the transgenic models, suggests that a modifier locus may influence the expression of these phenotypes in humans.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	190	Mutant presenilins may recruit new pools of substrate to the -secretase pathway to elevate production of Ass42 Studies of presenilin biology suggest that PS1 and PS2 compete for inclusion into a larger protein complex that contains nicastrin, Aph-1 and PEN-2 (18 to 27).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	191	 This complex is required for active -secretase, which is responsible for proteolytic processing of APP to generate the C-termini of Ass peptides (28,33).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Studies with chemical inhibitors of -secretase have shown that the cleavage of APP at the 40 site and 42 sites are coordinately suppressed, suggesting a single activity is responsible for both cleavages (50,51,68 to 70).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	193	 In this setting, the simplest explanation for the elevation of Ass42 relative to Ass40 in the presence of mutant PS1 was a simple shift in the enzyme specificity to favor cleavage at residue 42 with no net change in the amount of total Ass.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, our results indicate that the expression of FAD PS1 variants specified increases in the steady-state levels of Ass42 without altering Ass 40 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Expression of mutant PS1 thus leads to a net increase in total Ass.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	196	 A similar finding was reported by Oyama and colleagues in their study of mice transgenic for PS2-N141I, which also show a specific increase in Ass42 levels (46).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	197	Experiments in cell cultures have shown that co-expression of FAD PS1 variants with APP alters the ratio of Ass40 : 42 in the medium in favor of Ass42 (39 to 41).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In these cell culture experiments, it is assumed that the PS1 variants alter the production and secretion of Ass42 rather than altering its clearance or catabolism.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, the cell culture paradigms cannot replicate the complex architecture and signaling patterns of neurons the brain.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	200	 In hippocampal slice cultures, Kamenetz et al.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	201	 (71) recently demonstrated that neuronal activity can influence the secretion of Ass into the extracellular space.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	202	 In vivo, such as with the animal models used for our studies, it is difficult to separate changes in the production of Ass from changes in its catabolism.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	203	 However, based on the cell culture studies of APP processing, we believe it likely that the increase in steady-state levels of Ass42 measured in brain tissue from our mice reflects enhanced production of Ass42, rather than changes in its stability or clearance.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Studies demonstrating the absolute requirement of PS1 or PS2 function for an active -secretase (28,33) are consistent with this interpretation.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	205	Recent reports indicate that PS1 is required for the translocation of APP from the plasma membrane into endosomes where the -secretase cleavage that produces extracellular Ass is thought to occur (72), and that specific mutations in PS1 alter this movement (73 to 75).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Moreover, others have demonstrated that cells deficient in PS1 show alterations in the subcellular trafficking of specific membrane proteins (36,37).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	207	 However, studies in cultured cells have suggested that full-length APP is not the preferred substrate for -secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Instead, it appears that the direct substrates of -secretase are C-terminal fragments of APP generated by - or ss-secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	209	 These fragments, not the full-length protein, accumulate to high levels when -secretase is inhibited (28,30,31,33,49 to 52).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Whether the effects we have detected are due to changes in APP trafficking is unclear.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	211	 We note that an analysis of the levels of sAPP-ss, the soluble ectodomain of APP generated by BACE1, failed to detect obvious alterations due to co-expression of mutant PS1 (Supplementaly Material, Fig.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	212	In light of foregoing data, we favor the notion that PS1-A246E and PS1-dE9, with differing efficiencies, place a greater amount of APP-CTF substrate in contact with a -secretase that preferentially cleaves at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	213	 This mechanism would explain the specific elevation in Ass42 levels and the absence of change in Ass40 levels.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Moreover, this scenario could also explain how certain natural and experimental variants of PS1 differentially affect the cleavage of APP-CTFs and Notch, another important substrate of -secretase (32).
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We note that if the PS1/Nicastrin/PEN-2/Aph-1 protein complex were responsible for the delivery of substrates to -secretase but not their proteolysis, inhibition of the PS1 complex, either genetically or pharmacologically, would diminish -secretase activity in a manner indistinguishable from inhibiting -secretase itself.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Thus, we think it possible that one of the effects of mutant PS1 is to augment the amount of substrate presented to a 42-specific -secretase.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	217	   CONCLUSIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES   These studies have highlighted how small changes in the production of Ass42 can modulate the rate of amyloid deposition.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Within the limits imposed by the mouse lifespan, these small changes in Ass42 levels can make the difference between the appearance and absence of amyloid pathology.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We show here that this dichotomy is determined by a threshold concentration of Ass42, and that once this minimum is surpassed further elevations in Ass42 act to hasten the onset of amyloid aggregation.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	220	 These findings suggest that even partial reductions of Ass42 levels by pharmacological agents may substantially delay the onset of amyloid lesions in patients at risk for AD.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Our study is also the first to demonstrate that the presence of mutant PS1 results in more Ass42 by specifically increasing the concentration of this peptide without altering that of Ass40.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We suggest that mutant PS1 may act to recruit new pools of APP ss-CTF substrate to a -secretase that favors cleavage at residue 42.
0.48003986.14645205.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Altering the subcellular trafficking of APP substrates could therefore be another therapeutic approach to diminish the concentration of Ass42 the brains of patients with AD.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	8	 One of the most studied candidates is the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism (indel) of the gene for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This study aimed to clarify its association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The meta-analysis included 39 samples, comprising 6,037 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 12,099 controls, using mainly primary data.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Potential interactions with gender, age, ethnic group, and carrier status of the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were all examined.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	12	 D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	13	0004); I homozygotes showed no association with Alzheimer's disease, while heterozygotes were at increased risk.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although there were clear differences among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians), in all groups D homozygotes were at reduced risk.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These results confirm the association of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme indel with Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations, although this is probably due to linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further, in North Europeans, both association and Hardy-Weinberg analysis suggested partial heterosis, that is, an increased risk for heterozygotes, due to a hidden interaction with another, as yet unknown, risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This interaction warrants further investigation.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of the enzyme (2, 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	24	 (1) found that I positives, that is, DI + II, were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The study comprised three samples, from Cardiff and London in Britain and Belfast in Northern Ireland, with strikingly similar results.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	26	Since then, this potential association has been examined in over 40 samples (4, 5) (table 1) from around the world.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Several studies replicated the report of increased risk for I positives, just a few contradicted it, and many found no association with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	28	 One study suggested an effect of age on the association (6), and another proposed an influence of gender (7).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	29	 An association with onset age of Alzheimer's disease has also been proposed (8).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Cohorts used in the meta-analysis of the ACE* insertion-deletion polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	31	  The association has recently been studied in the longitudinal, observational cohorts of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) and the Rotterdam Study (9).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Both groups found a suggestion of a gender difference in their results, consistent with a previous report (7).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We therefore undertook a meta-analysis of studies of the association of the ACE indel with Alzheimer's disease, stratified by gender, by age, by ethnic group, and by apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4) carrier status, using mainly primary data, supplied by authors.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	34	Although three previous meta-analyses of ACE studies had been reported (10 to 12), subsequent studies have now made further data available.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In addition, all previous meta-analyses were based on published data, that is, largely unstratified, and were thus limited in the interpretations they allowed.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Using primary data, we were able to explore more deeply, searching for sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Two previous stratified meta-analyses of Alzheimer's disease genes (19, 20), based on primary data, have both deepened our understanding.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	39	 (21) have stressed the need to examine sources of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of case-control studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We therefore divided our analysis into two phases: first, a broad overall analysis and, second, the detailed examination of sources of heterogeneity.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The searches were updated in November 2004, without further data arising.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	44	 For the stratified analyses, we used the raw data or stratified summaries received from authors on 26 samples.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	45	 For the overall analyses, we also used published data, making 39 samples altogether (table 1).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Very early onset cases ( < 50 years) and young controls ( < 50 years) were excluded, where identifiable, as were subjects with incomplete data.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	52	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six possible sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	53	 We performed analyses stratified by age, gender, and APOE*4 status.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For the age stratifications ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years), we divided the samples into two groups, according to how the ages of cases had been defined, for example, at onset (first group) or at examination or death (second group).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also conducted analyses restricted to controls and to diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (25) or of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (26) (26 full samples and two part samples).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	56	 In separate analyses, we excluded eight samples where Hardy-Weinberg analysis and genotyping methods were compatible with mistyping.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Underreporting of heterozygotes may occur unless either 5 percent dimethyl sulfoxide is included in the polymerase chain reaction (27) or the DD genotype is confirmed by an insertion-specific second amplification (28).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In further analyses, samples were placed where possible (34 of 39 samples) in one of three ethnic groups: North European (19 samples); South Caucasian (11 samples), defined here as from the Mediterranean or from the Middle East; and East Asian (four samples), from China or from Japan.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	59	Data analysis and statistical methods Three methods are commonly used to produce odds ratios in genetic association studies: method 1, allelic (i.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	60	 I in this case); method 2, comparing each genotype with one other in turn (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	61	 DI); method 3, comparing each genotype in turn with the other two combined.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	62	 All three methods are subject to bias, the degree of bias depending on how imperfectly the model fits reality.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	63	 For instance, method 1 is best suited to testing a codominant model, where there is an allelic dose effect (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Method 3, on the other hand, may be used to test either an I-dominant/D-recessive or a D-dominant/I-recessive model.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	65	 We chose to follow the hypothesis-generating study (1) in using method 3, partly because preliminary examination of subsequent studies had shown no evidence of codominance.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	66	 We also used both methods 2 and 3 to examine heterosis (heterozygotes at greater or lesser risk than either homozygote).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Our main approach, method 3, gives an estimate of the risk associated with each genotype when compared with the rest of the population.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	68	Pooled odds ratios were calculated three times, by the fixed-effects method of Mantel and Haenszel (29), by the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird (30), and by the Bayesian random-effects method of Warn et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, as the results of all three methods were very similar, only those of the first two are shown (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The methods of meta-analysis permit the accumulation of results across independent studies, even where the number of subjects or the ratio of cases to controls varies considerably, as here in the cohort of Sleegers et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The heterogeneity test was by the method of Armitage (32).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Logistic regression analysis was used to compare odds ratios among ethnic groups.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Funnel plots (33) and cumulative meta-analysis (34) were used to investigate bias.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Analyses were performed using "R" (35) and the package "rmeta" by Thomas Lumley (http://www.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	76	 All tests of significance were two sided.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	126	 No effect of ACE*I carrier status on onset age of Alzheimer's disease and, surprisingly, only a modest effect of APOE*4 carrier status on onset age were seen (data not shown).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	127	Phase 2: examination of heterogeneity We examined six potential sources of heterogeneity: age, gender, race, APOE*4 status, misdiagnosis, and mistyping.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	129	 No significant effects were seen of gender or of APOE*4 status on the associations with Alzheimer's disease, nor did stratification by either of these two factors remove the heterogeneity (data not shown).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	130	 We calculated the odds ratios of Alzheimer's disease for ACE*D homozygotes versus I positives when stratified by age ( < 65 years, 65 to 75 years, and  > 75 years).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Rather little effect of age was seen on the association of D homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease (data not shown), nor was there any reduction in heterogeneity on stratification by age.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	132	 We repeated the overall analyses of the three genotypes, restricting the data to the 28 samples that could be limited to the more rigorous diagnoses of probable or definite Alzheimer's disease according to criteria of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (25) or the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (26).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The odds ratios were similar to those shown in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios by the method of DerSimonian and Laird (30) of 0.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	137	 There were 12 instances of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in individual studies and four in the six groups of pooled cases and controls analyzed by race (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We therefore excluded the eight samples where mistyping was considered possible, that is, underreporting of heterozygotes, taking into account both genotyping methods and Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We then repeated the overall analyses with the remaining 31 samples.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The odds ratios were similar to those in table 2, that is, significant odds ratios of 0.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	155	 We further examined heterosis (heterozygotes at greater risk) in North Europeans, by comparing DI with DD and with II in turn.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	156	 We found that heterozygotes were at higher risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.

0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	161	 We found no evidence of publication bias.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	162	ACE*D homozygotes were at reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (table 2) in each of the three main ethnic groups examined (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	163	 I homozygotes were neutral as regards Alzheimer's disease risk (table 2), except in East Asians, in whom I homozygotes may be at higher risk (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Heterozygotes were at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease overall (table 2) and mainly in North Europeans (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	165	 This example of heterosis will be discussed below.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Very similar results were achieved by three methods: fixed effects, random effects, and Bayesian random effects (refer to Materials and Methods and table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Only genotypic comparisons were made (refer to Materials and Methods), which showed that there was no allelic dose effect, except in East Asians (table 3), and that thus allelic comparisons would have proved less informative.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	168	These findings of odds ratios close to 1, even though significantly different from 1 (tables 2 and 3), suggest either linkage disequilibrium with the true risk factor or confounding by a hidden interaction or both.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The second possibility is discussed below.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Regarding the former, Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	171	 (1) in their study of ACE haplotypes gave evidence that the indel may not be the actual risk factor but rather in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby functional polymorphism that is the true risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	172	 ACE haplotype analysis has also proved of value with other phenotypes, such as enzyme levels (36), insulin levels, myocardial infarction, and obesity (37).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Future Alzheimer's disease studies may do better to examine polymorphisms in the regulatory regions, rather than the indel.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	174	The overall results were consistent with those of Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	175	 (1) from 1999 and also with those of the recent meta-analyses of Kehoe et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	176	 (11) from 2003 and of Elkins et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	177	 The latter report (12) also suggested an age difference, however, although actual ages were not available to them, only mean cohort ages, and they did not take into account the different ways of defining case ages (refer to Materials and Methods), a strongly confounding factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Because of the latter problem, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association might be stronger in younger cases, for example, in those aged less than 65 years at onset or less than 75 years at death.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	179	Heterogeneity Our overall results showed heterogeneity (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample selection (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	181	, in age, gender, or diagnosis) or in methods (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	182	, of genotyping), or it may be due to real differences in populations (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	183	, in race) or in interactions with other risk factors (e.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We examined all of these potential sources of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	185	 We found little effect of age, gender, or APOE*4 status, thus confounding our initial hypothesis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Both diagnostic and genotyping differences contributed some heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The former was mainly due to the diagnosis of "possible Alzheimer's disease," reported to have a poor record of confirmation at autopsy (38).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The latter was largely due to certain genotyping methods that may lead to underreporting of heterozygotes (27, 28), as shown by Hardy-Weinberg analysis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	189	However, the greatest source of heterogeneity was ethnic differences.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Ethnic stratification removed nearly all heterogeneity (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	191	 There were clear contrasts among the three ethnic groups examined (North Europeans, South Caucasians, and East Asians) in allelic frequencies and in odds ratios (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	192	 The latter might be due to differences in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (see above).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Some of these ethnic differences had previously been pointed out by Panza et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	194	 These contrasts highlight the dangers of combining ethnic groups within a single cohort, even North and South Europeans, as indicated by Panza et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Unfortunately, there was only one cohort of African origin, from the United States (41).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, no conclusions could be drawn about Africans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	197	Heterosis Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are common in studies of the ACE indel, as previously pointed out by Buss et al.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This may be due to either mistyping or heterosis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Several cases of such disequilibrium were indeed compatible with mistyping.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Most examples of disequilibrium in North Europeans, however, were of an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease, which requires another explanation.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	201	 We believe that explanation is heterosis.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Heterosis occurs when heterozygotes show either a greater or lesser association with a given trait than does either group of homozygotes.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	203	 In this case, in North Europeans, both an excess of heterozygotes in Alzheimer's disease and an association of heterozygotes with Alzheimer's disease were found.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Comings and MacMurray (42) have suggested three explanations for heterosis, of which their second can be applied here.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	205	 This proposes that heterosis may follow from the inadvertent combination of two unlike subsets due to a hidden interaction with another, unknown risk factor.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	206	 To test this proposal, we constructed a mathematical model with two equal subsets based on a median split of an unknown factor X (table 4).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	207	 The model illustrates how, although heterozygotes may have intermediate odds ratios in each subset, they can emerge with the highest odds ratio when the subsets are combined (i.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The overall results of this illustrative model (table 4) were very close to those of the present meta-analysis (table 2).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	209	 We should stress, however, that heterosis was found only in North Europeans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Moreover, although heterozygotes were at greater risk than D homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	211	25, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	212	45), they were not at significantly higher risk than I homozygotes (odds ratio = 1.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	213	08, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, partial heterosis better describes this case.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Model to show how heterosis may follow from the combination of two unlike subsets.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	216	  A hidden interaction Partial heterosis in North Europeans suggests an interaction with another risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, another potential source of heterogeneity.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Candidates include cardiovascular risk factors, since many also contribute to Alzheimer's disease risk and since the ACE indel has been associated with cardiovascular risk (43 to 47).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	218	Biologic background Full discussion of the biologic basis of these associations is outside the scope of this mainly analytical study.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	219	 However, we note the associations of the ACE indel and of nearby polymorphisms with various phenotypes, including cardiovascular risk (37, 43 to 47).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In addition, ACE protein levels are raised in certain brain regions with Alzheimer's disease (48 to 50), the enzyme has been reported to modify ss-amyloid aggregation (51), ACE inhibitors have been reported to maintain memory in aged rats (52) and in human patients (53), and brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors have been associated with both reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly hypertensive patients (54) and less cognitive decline in cases with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (55).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	221	 (9) have recently provided evidence from magnetic resonance imaging of increased atrophy in both the hippocampus and amygdala of nondemented women homozygous for the ACE*I allele, together with a modest but significant increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease, independent of vascular factors.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The D allele is associated with raised plasma levels of ACE (2), but that association is thought to be due to linkage disequilibrium with other nearby polymorphisms (3, 36).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	223	 There is an apparent conflict between the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and the associations of the indel with Alzheimer's disease risk and pathology and with plasma levels of ACE.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	224	 However, the influence of ACE polymorphisms on brain levels of the enzyme is not yet known and cannot be assumed to reflect the levels in plasma.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	225	 This subject warrants fuller discussion than is possible here.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	226	 A more detailed discussion is given by Kehoe (56), although it will need to be reconsidered and perhaps revised in the light of any interacting factor or factors that may emerge in future studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	227	Limitations of this meta-analysis The lack of information from some authors was a limitation, but we obtained full data on 84 percent of subjects.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The quality of diagnosis and of genotyping varied among studies, but our overall results were not changed when these questions were taken into account.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	229	 There was considerable heterogeneity in our initial results.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	230	 However, we found the main sources of that heterogeneity and were able to remove it.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Since cardiovascular factors are strong candidates for a potential interaction with ACE variants, the lack of data available to us on those factors was a limitation, which we hope will be overcome by future studies.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Cardiovascular factors might also have influenced our results through selective mortality.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	233	 However, D homozygotes have only a very slightly increased risk of cardiovascular complications (43 to 47, 57) and little evidence of any association with reduced life span (57 to 62).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Thus, the influence of selective mortality, if any, is likely to be very small and not enough to provide an alternative explanation for our findings.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	235	Conclusions We suggest that this large study has established the ACE indel as a marker of Alzheimer's disease risk, since we found no evidence of bias, we found and removed the main sources of heterogeneity, we excluded various potential interactions, and significant results remained in each of the three ethnic groups examined.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	236	 The indel, however, is probably in linkage disequilibrium with the true risk polymorphism (11).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	237	 There were marked contrasts among the three ethnic groups studied (table 3).
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We also found evidence of an interaction with another risk factor in North Europeans.
0.34448025.16033878.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Potential interactions with other factors than age, gender, and APOE*4 status should be examined, particularly interactions with cardiovascular risk factors.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	5	Received June 13, 1997; Revised and Accepted August 13, 1997.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	6	We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset age in the mid 50s.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce more A[beta]1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus providing a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) in model systems.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	8	Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have previously been identified (1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Those which lead solely to AD have been reported at two sites: at codon 717 and a double mutation at codons 670/1 (K/M670/1N/L) (for review see ref.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These mutations, and the presenilin mutations which also lead to FAD, have in common the feature that they increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43) (2 -8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Here we report the identification of a novel mutation in APP which is associated with an Alzheimer phenotype and show that it too results in an increased extracellular concentration of A[beta]42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	12	Here we report the identification of a new mutation in the APP gene (I716V) and demonstrate that this mutation also increases the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) in both transfected cells and in plasma, providing additional support for the hypothesis that alterations in A[beta] concentration are a critical and early feature in the development of AD.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Further, we demonstrate an additive increase in the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) from cells transfected with constructs containing both the I716V and the V717I mutations.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This finding provides a novel approach for further increasing A[beta]1-42(43) concentration in model systems.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	15	All the families with AD caused by APP mutations have disease onset ages from 45-60 years: most typically, with an onset age in the mid-50s.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In this context, the family we report here, in which the mean documented onset age was ~53 years, was a candidate for having an APP mutation.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Sequencing revealed a mutation changing the predicted amino acid at codon 716 from isoleucine to valine.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This mutation is likely to be pathogenic due to its proximity to the previously identified V717I mutation and it has not previously been observed in any of the hundreds of normal samples that we and others have previously sequenced.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The only other living affected family member did not wish to be sampled and this precluded segregation analysis of the mutation.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	20	A common feature of early onset FAD-linked mutations is to increase the concentration of A[beta] ending at A[beta]42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To determine whether the I716V mutation also affected the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-42(43), we performed transient transfection analysis in both CHO and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The results obtained from a representative experiment are shown in Table 1 .
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Relative to wild-type and the vector control, the I716V mutant cDNA caused a 30-60% increase in the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) in both of the cell lines examined.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This increase was similar to the effects of the V717I mutation analyzed in parallel in these series of experiments and as reported previously (3 ,8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Importantly, the increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]1-42(43) produced by I716V transfected cells was observed even when the absolute concentrations of A[beta]1-40 were essentially identical.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In order to both increase the `n' number for statistical analysis and account for variance in transfection efficiency between experiments we focused our subsequent analysis on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 as this has previously been shown to be elevated invariably in both the APP (V717I) and the presenilin mutations (2 -8 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The ratios obtained from three additional independent transient transfections in both HEK 293 and CHO cells have been combined with the ratios obtained from the experiment in Table 1 to produce Figure 1 .
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These results demonstrate an ~2-fold increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with the wild-type control (P = 0.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These data show that the I716V and the V717I mutations increase the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) and that the double mutant I716V/V717I increases the proportion of A[beta]1-42(43) more than each mutant individually.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The ratio (%) shows [A[beta]1-42(43)]/[A[beta]1-40] as a percentage.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The ratio represents the [A[beta]1-42(43)]/[A[beta]1-40] expressed as a percentage.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	37	We have previously reported elevations in plasma A[beta]42(43) concentration in patients with FAD-linked mutations (3 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The availability of only a single living identified carrier of the I716V mutation precluded an in depth analysis of plasma A[beta] concentration in this kindred.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	39	 An increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]42(43) was however observed in the plasma from this patient when compared with the average concentration of five non-demented, control subjects analyzed in parallel (Table 1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In fact, this individual had the highest concentration of A[beta]42(43) in this series despite having the second lowest concentration of A[beta]1-40.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, this mutation causes a clear increase in the absolute concentration of A[beta]42(43) in vivo.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	42	Thus, mutations at adjacent residues in APP, I716V and V717I, result in similar increases in the relative concentration of A[beta]1-42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Due to the proximity of these mutations and the nature of the amino acid changes we were interested in exploring the effect of the combination of these mutations on the A[beta]42 phenotype.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	44	 To address this question we constructed a cDNA containing both the I716V and V717I mutations in the pcDNA3 vector.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Our analysis of cells transiently transfected with this artificial double mutant construct demonstrated an increase in the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43) to A[beta]1-40 when compared with each individual mutation either separately (P = 0.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	46	 This feature may be useful in designing constructs which maximize A[beta]1-42(43) concentration for modeling the disease process.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	47	In conclusion, the results reported here extend the sites at which pathogenic APP mutations have been observed to five.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Importantly, these pathogenic mutations continue to follow the established pattern that they increase the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-42(43).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, these results provide further support for the hypothesis that alterations in the concentration of A[beta] play an early and critical role in the pathogenesis of AD.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Her maternal grandmother also had probable AD with an uncertain age of onset and death.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The clinical features (age of onset, slow progression of disease and preservation of social graces) were reminiscent of the first family, F23, in which I717V was discovered (16 ): indeed the similarity was so pronounced that exon 17 of the APP gene was sequenced immediately.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	69	Exon 17 of the APP gene was sequenced as previously described, except that a Pharmacia ALF automated sequencer was used.

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	78	 To evaluate the effect of mutant APP cDNAs on A[beta] concentrations we employed a transient transfection paradigm coupled with the well characterized BAN50/BA27 and BAN50/BC05 sandwich ELISA systems to determine the extracellular concentration of A[beta]1-40 and A[beta]1-42(43), respectively (Table 1 ).
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3 vector alone or with pcDNA3 containing APP695 wild-type, APP695 (I716V), APP695 (V717I), or APP695 (I716V,V717I) using DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) for 293 cells and Lipofectamine (Gibco BRL laboratories) for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells at DNA concentrations previously determined to yield maximal transfection efficiency in these cell types (data not shown).

0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The fresh medium was conditioned for 24-48 h to facilitate the measurement of A[beta] by sandwich ELISA.
0.3289425.9328472.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Due to variation in transfection efficiency we focused our analysis on the ratio of A[beta]1-42(43)to A[beta]1-40.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	27	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Most of the highly publicised advances in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease have concerned those very rare families with autosomal dominant forms of the disease, so-called familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindred, in which 50% of each generation, regardless of gender, succumb to Alzheimer's disease, usually by early mid-life (reviewed by Selkoe, 1999).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Yet, it is important to be able to recognise FAD because it is possible to offer such kindreds definitive genetic counselling, provided that the causative mutation can be identified.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, a study by Campion et al (1999) suggests that FAD may occur at a frequency of around 40 per 100 000 persons at risk, which implies that there are some 600 affected individuals to be found in England and Wales, a number that suggests that a psychiatrist or neurologist will encounter an individual from a FAD pedigree at some time in their working life.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The first step is to confirm that the diagnosis is actually one of Alzheimer's disease and not one of the other, often familial, dementias such as Huntington's disease, frontal-temporal dementias, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Next, the clinician should take as detailed a family history as possible in order to try to determine whether the sufferer comes from a pedigree with autosomal dominant FAD: the occurrence of numerous individuals with early-onset disease ( < 55 years) in several generations is highly suggestive.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The presence of many affected individuals in one generation may also raise suspicion because it should not be forgotten that early death from other causes might prevent manifestation of the disorder in carriers of a disease gene.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In practice, we recommend that families containing three members with a history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease occurring before the age of 60 years should, if they request advice, be referred to a clinical geneticist.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Some forms of FAD linked to PSEN2 mutations occur after the age of 65 years, and so the psychiatrist should have a low threshold for discussing a pedigree with a clinical geneticist.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	40	Predictive or prenatal testing is potentially feasible in families with FAD but will depend upon the availability of DNA from at least one affected individual in order to establish which mutation is causing disease in that family.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	41	 It is worth stating that genetic counselling is a highly specialised area and it is strongly recommended that psychiatrists do not involve themselves without the appropriate training.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	42	The study by Campion et al (1999) analysed DNA from 34 families with FAD (obtained from all over France) for causative mutations.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Probably pathogenic mutations were found in the PSEN1 gene in 19 families, mutations within the APP gene in another 5 and no mutations in the PSEN1, PSEN2 or APP genes in the remaining 10 families.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Thus, individuals from FAD pedigrees need to be informed that there is a 30% chance that, with the current state of our knowledge, no causative mutation will be found.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	45	 If no mutation is found then, if the pedigree is strongly suggestive of an autosomal dominant disorder, the geneticist may choose to go on to search for mutations in genes associated with similar conditions   prion protein (PrP) in CJD and tau in frontal temporal dementias, for example.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Yet another factor to consider is that there has been one report of apparent non-penetrance of a PSEN1 mutation in a healthy 68-year-old member of a FAD pedigree (Rossor et al, 1996).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Notwithstanding these caveats, in the absence of any preventive treatment, the take-up for predictive testing is likely to be low, as has been the case in Huntington's disease (Binedell et al, 1998).

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	53	When faced with someone who is worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease it is often worth pointing out that we are all at some risk of developing Alzheimer's disease provided that we live long enough.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The large Rotterdam study suggests that the risk at age 55 years of developing dementia in the following 35 years is 0.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In this study 73% of dementia was wholly or partially attributable to Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The large continuing Framingham study yields somewhat lower lifetime risks of Alzheimer's disease after the age of 65 years: 6.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	58	9% and 19%, respectively (Seshadri et al, 1997).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The reasons for this are not clear, but increased longevity compared to men, increased survival with the disease and some increase in intrinsic vulnerability probably all play a part.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	61	Prevalence studies tell us that dementia doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 years up to the age of around 85 years, after which time the rate of increase appears to slow (Heeren et al, 1991; Skoog et al, 1993; Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995; Breitner et al, 1999; von Strauss et al, 1999).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It is likely that some of this slowing is due to very old people not living as long with their dementia as younger sufferers do, although it is also possible that survivors into late old age are relatively resistant to developing dementia (Drachman, 1994).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Prevalence data are summarised in Table 1.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	65	In fact, two nearly completely ascertained community-based studies, one from Japan and one from The Netherlands, found that the prevalence of dementia in centenarians was very high: 70% in the Japanese and 88% in the Dutch sample (Asada et al, 1996; Blansjaar et al, 2000).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Asada et al (1996) attributed some 76% of the dementia to Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate was 27% for the centenarians with dementia, whereas none of the non-demented centenarians died.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	67	Thus, prevalence figures for dementia tell us that many of us are at some risk of developing dementia, provided that we live long enough.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This is obviously too simplistic: most people do not expect to live into their mid-90s; a much more reasonable question is, "What is my chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by the age of 85 years?".

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	73	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   In the 1980s and early 1990s there were a number of family studies that attempted to identify the inheritance pattern of Alzheimer's disease and to quantify the risk to first-degree relatives in families with a history of Alzheimer's disease, in comparison with family members of control individuals (summarised in McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	74	 There have also been a few studies based on more representative community samples.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	75	Overall, the findings from studies based in memory clinics (that are likely to be centres of secondary referral) suggest that 30-48% of probands with Alzheimer's disease have a history of affected first-degree relatives compared with 13-19% of controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This translates to 6-14% of the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease having a history of Alzheimer's disease compared with 3.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	77	5-7% of the first-degree relatives of healthy controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Kaplan Meier life table analysis has been used in these studies to infer that the cumulative risk of dementia by age 90 varies between 30 and 50% compared with between 10 and 23% in control relatives.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, as has been pointed out by Breitner, owing to competing causes of death, only about one-third of this theoretical familial predisposition to Alzheimer's disease is realised in the usual life span.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	80	 This translates to an actual predicted risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease of 15-19%, compared with 5% in controls (Breitner et al, 1988; Breitner, 1991).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	81	The latest systematically ascertained twin studies on the heritability of Alzheimer's disease also tend to support the estimates of familial risk derived from family studies.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Probandwise, concordance rates of about 40% and 84%, respectively, are seen in fraternal and identical twins (Bergem et al, 1997).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Because fraternal twins are genetically equivalent to ordinary first-degree relatives, the observed morbid risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is similar to that estimated for first-degree relatives in family studies.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	84	A study by Silverman et al (1994) suggested that, in large measure, the familial component of risk to the relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease was expended by the end of the ninth decade, after which time the risk was very similar to that in controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	85	 A number of other family history studies have suggested that familial factors are more prominent when onset is earlier (McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, much of Alzheimer's disease in late old age may be considered as not very familial and merely an expression of one of the ways in which the ageing process is manifested in those few survivors into late old age.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	87	The findings from these family studies can be used to advise relatives in only the broadest terms.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	88	 One can do little more than to say that, on balance, the risk to the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease who developed the disorder at any time up to the age of 85 years is increased some threefold to fourfold relative to the risk in controls.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This would seem to translate to a risk of developing Alzheimer's disease of between one in five and one in six, which, although an improvement on a risk of one in two, can still be rather frightening.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In order to put this risk into better perspective, and to help allay the client's anxiety, it may be preferable to present the risk estimates in a graphical form, as is done in Fig.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If this is done, clients can see that even at 78 years, the age of greatest risk, the actual predicted risk is only some 3% and that the cumulative risk (half the area under the curve f(x) S(x)) from age 65 to 78 is probably less than 10%.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In our experience many tell us that this is reassuring   partly because their worries were about getting Alzheimer's disease in their fifties "because this is when familial Alzheimer's disease happens" or in their sixties/seventies, thus preventing them from enjoying retirement.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Of course, it is possible that some of the same genes that confer longevity may also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like other disorders that reflect the combined action of several genes, the risk to relatives drops rapidly as the degree of genetic relatedness falls.

0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	158	Late-onset Alzheimer's disease For late-onset Alzheimer's disease there is wide agreement that there is no genetic test available, but genetic testing is not the same as genetic counselling.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The absence of a test should not mean that relatives are denied information and the opportunity to discuss their concerns.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	160	 So, when asked "am I likely to get Alzheimer's disease?" by the relative of a patient with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, how should one answer? In most cases of Alzheimer's disease it is only possible to advise relatives of their risk in the broadest terms.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Extrapolating from family history studies, it is possible to say that the risk to the children is in the region of one in five to one in six and one should be prepared to illustrate what this means in an easy to understand graphical form.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We believe that it is permissible for such a broad estimate of risk to be imparted by a consultant or doctor not specifically trained in genetic counselling.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	163	Occasionally, psychiatrists encounter families with several siblings affected by late-onset Alzheimer's disease and a history of dementia in previous generations.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Such families almost certainly exhibit high genetic loading, but there are few reliable data on whether and to what extent risk increases with the number of affected relatives, although studies of other common disorders suggest that this is likely to be the case.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, it should be borne in mind that the number of affected relatives may well depend on factors affecting longevity as well as on the degree of genetic loading for Alzheimer's disease, and it may not be advisable or possible to base discussion on risk estimates that are increased when several relatives have been affected in late old age.
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	166	 There is also preliminary evidence for substantially increased risk in the offspring of parents who both have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Bird et al, 1993).
0.51095337.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In such pedigrees, if relatives request further information, it may be worth taking a detailed family history and consulting with a clinical geneticist.

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	25	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Although there has been controversy about the relative importance of plaques versus tangles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that altered metabolism of Ass peptides and amyloid deposition in neuritic plaques causes Alzheimer's disease by triggering a complex pathological cascade that produces dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The Ass peptides Ass1-40 and Ass1-42, the two major species of Ass, are generated from APP by sequential proteolytic cleavage by ss- and - secretases.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These enzymes are not the only ones involved in the breakdown of APP: -secretase cleaves the full-length APP, producing soluble sAPP and, subsequently, p3.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Because processing by -secretase precludes production of full-length Ass peptides, it is anti-amyloidogenic (Younkin, 1998).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Mutations in the gene for APP and in presenilin (PS1/2) genes are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and with a selective increase in Ass1-42 (Borchelt et al, 1996; Mann et al, 1996; Scheuner et al, 1996; Kosaka et al, 1997; Younkin, 1998).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Brain levels of Ass1-42 increase early in the development of Alzheimer's disease and are strongly correlated with cognitive decline (Cummings  and  Cotman, 1995; Naslund et al, 2000), and plasma levels of Ass1-42 are higher in elderly people who subsequently develop Alzheimer's disease than in those who remain free of dementia (Mayeux et al, 1999).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	33	Virtually all individuals with Down's syndrome have neuropathological changes consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by the time they reach 40 years of age, including deposition of Ass in diffuse and neuritic plaques (Wisniewski, H.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	34	 et al, 1995; Mann, 1988), and most will develop dementia by the end of their seventh decade of life (Lai  and  Williams, 1989).

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease at age 65 has ranged between 30% and 75% (Zigman et al, 1997).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Most studies have shown that the average age at onset of dementia is between 50 and 55 years, with a range from 38 to 70 years (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Prasher  and  Krishnan, 1993).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Methodological problems may account for some of the variation in estimated prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	42	 There is, as yet, no consensus on a set of cognitive assessment tasks or on diagnostic criteria for existing cognitive assessment batteries that can differentiate adults with Down's syndrome who do and do not have dementia in its early stages.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Presently, most diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome are made clinically, at relatively late stages of the disease, without systematic cognitive or functional testing over time.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	44	The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for APP located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al, 1989) and the increased risk of dementia in Down's syndrome may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of Ass peptides.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age.

0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	151	 An important task for future work will be to identify the sources of individual variation in premorbid Ass levels.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Since 95% of people with Down's syndrome have triplication of APP associated with free trisomy, overexpression of APP cannot account for the differences in age at onset of dementia within this population.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Rather, the joint effects of a variety of factors, including those reviewed here and others not yet identified, must influence the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.47823864.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This suggests that we will need to focus on younger adults with Down's syndrome to identify causes of individual differences in lifespan development and to determine when they begin to exert their effects.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	5	, Sunnyvale, California 94043 ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION FOOTNOTES Acknowledgments Note Added in Proof REFERENCES.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	6	Presenilins 1 and 2 are unglycosylated proteins with apparent molecular mass of 45 and 50 kDa, respectively, in transfected COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	7	 They colocalize with proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in transfected and untransfected cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In COS-1 cells low amounts of intact endogeneous presenilin 1 migrating at 45 kDa are detected together with relative larger amounts of presenilin 1 fragments migrating between 18 and 30 kDa.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The presenilins have a strong tendency to form aggregates (mass of 100-250 kDa) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which can be partially resolved when denatured by SDS at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, or acylation of the presenilins was not observed, but both proteins are posttranslationally phosphorylated on serine residues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The mutations Ala-246  Glu or Cys-410  Tyr that cause Alzheimer's disease do not interfere with the biosynthesis or phosphorylation of presenilin 1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Finally, using low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the cell membrane but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, it is demonstrated that the two major hydrophilic domains of presenilin 1 are oriented to the cytoplasm.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The current investigation documents the posttranslational modifications and subcellular localization of the presenilins and indicates that postulated interactions with amyloid precursor protein metabolism should occur in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	14	Alzheimer's disease is a major health problem.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Patients suffer from a progressive dementia caused by massive neuronal loss in cortical and hippocampal areas of the brain (1-6).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Neuropathological signs of the disease are tangles and amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma, and amyloid deposits in the brain vasculature.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The cause of the sporadic form of the disease is still unknown, although an increased risk is associated with the presence of apolipoprotein allele E4 (6, 7).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	18	 On the other hand, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease is caused by point mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 (8), in the presenilin 2 (PS2)1 gene on chromosome 1 (9-11), or, most frequently, in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (12-15).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I integral membrane protein and is the precursor of the amyloid peptide, the main component of the senile plaques (1-3).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Point mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene cause alterations in the metabolism of APP.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This results in an increased production of intracellular A4 amyloid peptide containing carboxyl-terminal APP fragments and in an increased secretion of the potentially neurotoxic A4 peptide (1-3, 16).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	22	 63% of the amino acid residues in the sequences of the two presenilins are conserved, which strongly suggests that both proteins are involved in similar functions and have a similar pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Based on computer algorithms, seven membrane spanning domains have been defined (9-15), although the possibility of nine transmembrane domains cannot be ruled out at this moment (17).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The amino-terminal domain and the acidic loop domain, located between transmembrane domains six and seven, are hydrophilic and can be alternatively spliced (9, 13).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease are found all over the protein, but the hydrophilic loop constitutes a "hot spot" with nine different mutations described to date (5, 15).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The biological function of the presenilins remains essentially unknown, but, interestingly, the 103 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of PS2 can inhibit apoptosis in a "deathtrap" assay (18).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Based on the homology with Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, roles in intracellular protein sorting and/or intercellular signal transmission have been proposed as well (19, 20).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	28	A hypothetical final common pathway in the pathogenesis of the genetic and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease has been postulated, based on the invariable occurrence of the amyloid deposits, the neurofibrillar tangles and the neurodegeneration in all affected brains.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The central question is thus how mutations in the presenilin genes can cause this typical neuropathology.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Studies indicating an increased production of more amyloidogenic A4-(1-42) peptide in fibroblasts obtained from patients with presenilin mutations would support the amyloid hypothesis that postulates abnormal A4 amyloid peptide production and plaque formation as the pivotal event in the pathogenesis of the disease (2, 21).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, the observed increases in A4-(1-42) peptide production were relatively small, and the suggested relationship between presenilin mutations and APP metabolism should be further corroborated by experiments showing directly the effect of presenilin mutations on APP processing in transfected cells or in brains of transgenic animals.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, other aspects of APP metabolism such as the production of carboxyl-terminal APP fragments (16) should be investigated in greater detail.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The possibility that presenilins interact with the cytoskeleton or exert their effect via apoptotic pathways should not be disregarded at this time (18).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition to addressing these questions, basic information is needed on the subcellular localization, the posttranslational modifications, and the membrane orientation of the presenilins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	35	We used COS-1 cells and CHO cells to express PS1 and PS2, as well as Myc-tagged PS1 and PS1-containing mutations that cause familial Alzheimer's disease.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The biosynthesis of transfected and untransfected presenilins was studied using immunoblotting or metabolical labeling and immunoprecipitation assays.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We demonstrate that transfected presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we document the association of presenilin 1 with the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway and demonstrate the cytoplasmic orientation of the two major hydrophilic domains.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	39	The cDNA coding for mouse PS1 and human PS1, PS2, and PS1 containing Ala-246  Glu (FAD1) or Cys-410  Tyr (NIH2) mutations have been described (9, 12).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	40	 A Myc-tagged PS1 fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5-CGGGATCCATTATGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCG-3 and 5-GATCACATGCTTGGCGCCATAT-3 (the sequence coding for the Myc tag is underlined).

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	233	 the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain (12) are oriented toward the cytoplasmic or the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	234	 Current models for the orientation of the presenilins in membranes are based on theoretical predictions (see "Discussion").
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	235	 Both domains are candidate regions for interactions with other proteins, and their orientation determines whether this interaction occurs with cytoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum proteins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	236	 To analyze this question, we used low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (see "Materials and Methods") and antibodies against the amino-terminal domain (antiserum B14), against the Myc tag introduced at the amino terminus (mAb 9E10), against the second loop domain (antibody 519), and, finally, against the hydrophilic loop domain (antiserum B16) of PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	237	 To monitor the permeabilization procedure, rat monoclonal antibody against the luminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal KDEL was used (30, 31).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Antibodies against the amino-terminal domain of PS1, against the amino-terminally inserted Myc tag (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	239	 9a) or against the hydrophilic loop (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	240	 9e) reacted with PS1 in digitonin-permeabilized cells under conditions in which the KDEL-specific monoclonal antibody did not result in labeling (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	241	 On the other hand, antibodies against the second hydrophilic loop domain (519) reacted with PS1 when saponin (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	242	 9d), but not when digitonin (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	243	 9c) was used to permeabilize the cells, suggesting a luminal localization of this domain.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	244	 Cytoplasmic orientation of the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop of PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	245	 COS-1 cells transfected with PS1Myc (panels a and b) or with PS1 WT (panels c-f) were permeabilized using digitonin (panels a, c, and e) or saponin (panels b, d, and f) and immunostained with anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (panels a and b), with polyclonal antibody 519 against the second loop domain (panels c and d), with polyclonal antibody B16 (panels e and f) and with rat monoclonal antibody against the KDEL sequence (panels a-f).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	246	 PS1 immunoreactivity is observed as red/yellow staining, while KDEL immunoreactivity is green.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	247	 Panels a and b show that the amino terminus of PS1 is oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Cells that express PS1Myc stain strongly with the amino-terminal domain directed 9E10 mAb both in digitonin (a) or saponin (b) permeabilized cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	249	 When saponin is used, the untransfected cells are stained with the KDEL antibody (green) since it reacts with endogenous proteins (b).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	250	 When digitonin is used, no staining is observed (a), indicating that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is not permeable for antibodies under the conditions used.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	251	 In panels c and d, similar experiments are displayed but using antiserum 519 against the second loop domain.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Staining is only observed when saponin is used, indicating a luminal orientation of this domain (panel d).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	253	 Panels e and f demonstrate that antiserum B16 against the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 react both with digitonin (e) or saponin (f) permeabilized cells, indicating a cytoplasmic orientation of the hydrophilic loop.

0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	255	The current investigation provides a detailed characterization of the biosynthesis of presenilins overexpressed in COS-1 cells and CHO cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	256	 The results show that the PS proteins are unglycosylated phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of about 45 and 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	257	 They have a strong tendency to form SDS-resistant complexes with apparent molecular masses between 100 and 250 kDa.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Double immunofluorescence studies showed that PS1 is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus and that its amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop domain are oriented to the cytoplasmic side.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	259	The localization of transfected PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of COS-1 cells or CHO cells is not a simple consequence of overexpression of the protein or nonspecific general effects on the biosynthetic pathway in these cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	260	 First, endogeneous presenilins are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells as demonstrated in Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	261	 1A using confocal laser microscopy.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Second, using identical transfection conditions, APP and furin were found to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated before (33, 34).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	263	 4) and the secretory processing of APP3 in CHO cells stably expressing human APP770 was not affected by transfection of PS1, ruling out general inhibitory effects on protein transport and processing.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	264	 On the other hand, the levels of endogeneous presenilin in COS-1 cells are apparently very low.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Only the combination of immunoprecipitation to concentrate PS1 from detergent extracts of 10  x  106 cells, followed by immunoblotting using mAb PS1-3, allowed us to detect endogeneous PS1 migrating at the same molecular weight as transfected PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	266	 The disadvantage of this approach is that the antibodies from the immunoprecipitation step interfere with the consecutive detection of possible PS-aggregates in the immunoblotting step (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	267	 This assay also precludes a dynamic analysis of the metabolism of the presenilins using metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	268	 On the other hand, it allowed us to demonstrate the presence or absence of particular antibody epitopes on PS1 fragments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	269	 Importantly, the use of hydrophilic loop-specific antibodies in the immunoprecipitation step resulted in the detection of relative large amounts of, presumably proteolytic, fragments of PS1 in the 18-30-kDa range (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	270	 The level of these fragments was not, or only slightly, increased in COS-1 cells that overexpressed PS1, which explains why they were not readily detected in the transfection experiments.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The proteolytic process involved is probably easily saturated or even inhibited by PS overexpression (35, 36).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Our data therefore do not allow us to speculate any further on the exact nature or the biological significance of this process.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	273	 We can only conclude that overexpression studies of the type used here are not suitable to study this particular aspect of presenilin metabolism.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	274	 On the other hand, it is clear that untransfected cells (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	275	 3) and brain tissue in vivo (36, 37) contain detectable amounts of intact presenilin.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Since this endogeneously expressed PS1 has the same mobility as transfected PS1, the conclusion that transfected PS1 (and PS2) are not subject to glycosylation, sulfation, glycosaminoglycan modification, palmitoylation, or myristoylation also holds apparently true for the endogeneous protein.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	277	 These posttranslational modifications are thereby also excluded as contributing to the formation of the high molecular mass, SDS-resistant aggregates (100-250 kDa) in SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	278	 These aggregates were observed to a variable extent in all our experiments, and were noticed by others using other cell types or brain tissue (36, 38, 39).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Since the smears were detected with three different antibodies recognizing three different epitopes, and by a Myc-directed mAb using a Myc-tagged PS1 construct, the aggregates must contain presenilin core proteins, alone or associated with unidentified components.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Denaturation of immunoprecipitates at 37  degrees C instead of 95  degrees C, resulted in less aggregates and increased amounts of the 45-kDa PS1 band (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The aggregates therefore probably consist mainly of oligomers of presenilins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	282	 It is unclear whether this property to form SDS-resistant aggregates in vitro has any physiological significance in vivo, but immuno-electron microscope observations suggest that clustering of presenilins also occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of untransfected cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	283	2 It should be envisaged that in pathological conditions exacerbated aggregation of presenilins could become a problem.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	284	 In this context, it should be mentioned that antibodies against PS1 stain amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (40).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	285	Importantly, the two point mutations causing Alzheimer's disease that were studied here, i.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	286	 PS1 Ala-246  Glu (FAD1 kindred) and PS1 Cys-410  Tyr (NIH2 kindred), did not alter the biosynthesis or level of expression of the PS1 protein in COS-1 cells and CHO cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	287	 These mutations must cause therefore more subtle effects.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	288	 The possibility that they interfere with the fragmentation of PS1, as was shown recently for two other mutations (35, 36), cannot be excluded from the current data.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Analysis of brains of transgenic mice expressing the PS1 Ala-246  Glu mutant indicate, however, that at least this mutation does not interfere with the proteolytic processing of PS1.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	290	4 Since all PS mutations known to date act in a dominant way in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a gain of function is most likely.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Evidence that fibroblasts derived from patients with presenilin mutations produce more and longer forms of the A4 amyloid peptide suggests that the mutations exert their effect on cellular metabolism or trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (21).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	292	 The localization of PS1 in the early compartments of the biosynthetic pathway makes it unlikely that the presenilin mutations directly influence - and/or -secretase activity, since these operate in the late-Golgi and transport vesicles, at the cell surface and in endosomes (27, 41-43).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The possibility that PS mutants influence the balance between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in an indirect way by changing its intracellular trafficking should now be further explored in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and neurons (16, 44, 45).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	294	Our study demonstrates furthermore that the presenilins are phosphorylated on serine residues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	295	 Phosphorylation of PS1 and PS2 was evident both in COS-1 cells and CHO cells, but the phosphorylation of PS1 was less intense and more variable than of PS2.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	296	 The observation that okadaic acid enhanced the PS1 phosphorylation suggests that PS1 is more prone to phosphatase activity than PS2 (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Protein kinase C is not responsible for PS phosphorylation, since neither stimulation of cells by phorbol esters nor purified kinase added to immunoprecipitated PS1 or PS2 resulted in increased labeling.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	298	 It is therefore unlikely that the presenilins are directly involved in the regulation of APP secretion by protein kinase C (46, 47).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	299	Finally, we showed that the hydrophilic NH2-terminal and the major loop domain of PS1 are exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Digitonin at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the cell membrane, but not the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (29).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Antibodies directed toward the amino-terminal domain of PS1 (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	302	 9) displayed similar immunofluorescent staining patterns in digitonin and saponin permeabilized cells.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Control experiments with antibodies against a luminal epitope, i.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	304	 the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (30, 31), showed that digitonin did not permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	305	 For the major hydrophilic loop domain, essentially identical results were obtained.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	306	 The conclusion therefore is that the two major hydrophilic domains in PS1 are oriented to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, which directs the search for candidate proteins interacting with these domains toward the cytoplasm.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	307	 Consistent with this conclusion, antibodies against the second loop domain reacted with PS1 after saponin, but not after digitonin permeabilization.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	308	 This not only confirms the luminal localization of the recognized epitope, but also validates the approach as it was used.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	309	While more detailed studies, including electron microscopy and enzymatic digestion protection assays, are required to settle definitively the orientation of the presenilins in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, our results clarify already two important issues.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The first problem is the orientation of the first transmembrane domain in PS1, which determines in fact the topology of all the following transmembrane domains (46).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	311	 The positive charge difference between the 15 carboxyl-terminal and the 15 amino-terminal residues flanking the first membrane spanning domain suggests a luminal orientation of its amino terminus (48).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	312	 However, several exceptions to this rule are known, mainly of proteins of which the amino-terminal domain contains more then 17 charged amino acid residues (48).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	313	 In PS1, this domain contains 29 charged residues, which would explain its cytoplasmic orientation.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	314	 The second issue, which has been pointed out by others before (9, 13, 17), is whether two putative hydrophobic stretches in the PS amino acid sequence flanking the hydrophilic loop, can additionally span the membrane, which would make the presenilins nine transmembrane domain proteins.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	315	 Our data are compatible with a seven-transmembrane domain model with the amino-terminal domain and the hydrophilic loop located in the cytoplasm (Fig.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	316	 10; see also Note Added in Proof).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	317	 In conclusion, the current study has analyzed the biosynthesis and the subcellular localization of the presenilins and provides a basis for the further study of their cell biology and their possible interactions with integral membrane and cytoplasmic proteins such as APP or Tau, both implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (4).
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Localization of antibody epitopes and orientation of PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	319	 PS1 is inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with both its amino-terminal (NH2-) and hydrophilic loop domain at the cytoplasmic side.
0.46781272.9013610.html.plaintext.txt	320	 The localization of the peptides used to raise the different antibodies used to study the topology of PS1 are indicated by bars above the sequence (see also "Materials and Methods" and Note Added in Proof).

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	2	   Introduction Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   Notch signaling is both simple and complex.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	3	 It is simple because no secondary messengers are required as Notch can directly report to the nucleus after contact with ligand at the plasma membrane.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Notch acts as a membranebound transcription factor that is released in response to ligand binding by two proteases acting sequentially.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	5	 The freed intracellular domain enters the nucleus, where it interacts with a DNA-bound protein to activate transcription of selected targets.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Notch signaling is complex because it regulates an astonishingly large number of cellular decisions during development (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	7	, 1999) and in the adult (Milner and Bigas, 1999).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, the regulation of Notch proteolysis is complex, involving an array of accessory proteins whose functions have been elucidated only recently (Kramer, 2001; Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Finally, genetic experiments indicate that Notch may also have a separate, proteolysis-independent function at the membrane, where it acts together with Wnt to affect developmental competence (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	10	In the poster, panel A summarizes the proteins in the Notch signal transduction pathway for which biochemical functions have been proposed.

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	13	   Panel A Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   The core elements of the Notch signaling system include the Notch receptor, DSL ligands (Delta and Serrate/Jagged in Drosophila and vertebrates, Lag-2 in C.

0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Only some target genes are known and the first identified are members of the HES (Hairy/Enhancer of Split) family of basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulators (not illustrated).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Notch proteins (and ligands) contain extracellular EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like repeats.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The repeats 11-12 of Notch (pink) interact with the DSL domain of ligands (pink).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The EGF repeats in Delta-like ligands are continuous whereas in the Serrate-like ligands they are interspersed with short linker sequences.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Notch can be modified in the Golgi by a glycosyltransferase called Fringe (Blair, 2000) on specific fucose-modified EGF repeats.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Fringe is expressed only in a subset of cells; Notch is hyperactivated when Fringe-expressing and -nonexpressing territories abut, forming a boundary (Irvine and Rauskolb, 2001; Wu and Rao, 1999).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Notch is secreted to the cell surface in a Furin-convertase-dependent step (Logeat et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The LNR (Lin/Notch Repeat; red) domain maintains the association between the polypeptides resulting from the Furin cleavage (at site 1 or S1).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The intracellular domain contains the RAM23 domain (RAM), which enhances interaction with CSL protein.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) contains nuclear localization signals (NLS), a CDC 10/ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), which mediates interactions with CSL and other proteins, and a domain rich in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine residues (PEST).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Also shown are neuralized (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), presenilin (an intramembrane cleaving protease; I-CliP) (Huppert and Kopan, 2001) and Nicastrin, a protein that interacts with presenilin and is required for plasma membrane localization and stabilization of presenilin (Kopan and Goate, 2002).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Presenilin and Nicastrin are part of -secretase, an activity contributing to Alzheimer's disease (Kopan and Goate, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A metalloprotease at the cell surface is also required for Notch signaling (Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the nucleus, CSL binds SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) and SKIP (ski-related protein).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These proteins facilitate nuclear localization of CSL (Zhou and Hayward, 2001) and, together with histone deacetylase (HDAC), repress transcription from target genes (Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In Drosophila, CSL interacts with Hairless and C-terminalbinding protein (CtBP) to mediate repression (see panel 5) (Morel et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This is the basal state of cells in which Notch is inactive or absent.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	32	   Panel B Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   Notch signaling starts with ligand binding (1-1').
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Although all DSL proteins bind Notch that has not been modified by Fringe (1'), in cells expressing Fringe (1) ligands show distinct preferences.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Delta prefers Fringe-modified Notch, whereas Serrate would much rather bind unmodified Notch.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	35	 These preferences are the basis for Notch hyperactivation at boundaries between Fringe-expressing and -nonexpressing territories.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	36	Despite being associated with the presenilin complex, Notch cannot be cleaved since its extracellular domain somehow blocks presenilin activity.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	37	 After ligand binding, neuralized adds a ubiquitin to the intracellular domain of delta and triggers its endocytosis (2) (Kramer, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Ligand endocytosis triggers a conformational change in Notch that permits metalloproteases to cleave near the membrane at a second site (S2), then the extracellular domain is trans-endocytosed to the ligand-expressing cell (3) (Parks et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This event permits presenilin to cleave Notch at a third site (S3) located within its transmembrane domain (4) (Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	40	 NICD is now free to translocate to the nucleus.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In cells expressing both Notch and ligand, ligand interferes with this process by an unknown mechanism; this interference may be relieved by the neuralized protein, which targets Delta for degradation (Kramer, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	42	Once in the nucleus, NICD converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator (5-8).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Our current understanding proposes that this conversion occurs by direct protein-protein interactions between the Notch intracellular domain, SKIP and CSL, which leads to SMRT/HDAC dissociation (reviewed by Mumm and Kopan, 2000).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This alone is sufficient to express some target genes.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Notch/CSL can recruit histone acetylases (HATs) to assist in chromatin remodeling, and Mastermind/Lag-3 to activate additional targets.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The metabolism of NICD in the nucleus is controlled by phosphorylation and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sel-10 (Gupta-Rossi et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	47	, 2001) and Su(Dx) (Cornell et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	48	 NICD degradation resets the cell and prepares it for the next round of Notch signaling.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	49	   Panel C Top Introduction Panel A Panel B Panel C References   Another activity of Notch, independent of DSL ligands and CSL proteins, was observed during Drosophila myogenesis and neurogenesis (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	50	, 2001; Rusconi and Corbin, 1999).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The evidence for the existence of such a signaling axis in Drosophila is compelling, although still at an earlier phase of discovery compared with the Notch/CSL axis (A,B).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Therefore, many of the arrows in this panel describe genetic interactions rather than biochemical mechanism.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	53	Two specific regions of Notch are required for this activity: the `Abruptex' region of Notch (EGF repeats 17-29, dark blue) (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	54	, 2001) and the region C-terminal to the ANK repeats that contains the PEST domain (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This region was previously shown to bind Dishevelled (Dsh).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Dsh is a mediator of Wnt signals downstream of the Frizzled (Frz) receptors (Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	57	 During Drosophila neurogenesis, CSL-dependent Notch signals restrict neural competence to a small number of cells within an equivalence group (Kopan and Turner, 1996).
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In this newly recognized role, Notch acts to prevent cells from acquiring neural or myogenic competence earlier in development.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Although it is unclear how Notch mediates this effect, or how many additional proteins are involved, this activity requires Deltex, a cytoplasmic ring finger protein (Ramain et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	60	, 2001) and the kinase GSK3ss (Sgg) (Brennan et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Deltex and CSL appear to be antagonistic, possibly because both compete for the ANK domain of Notch.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This cytoplasmic Notch activity may not require proteolysis (1,1'), however, it has not been determined yet whether presenilin or other proteases are required for the Deltex-dependent Notch activity.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Wnt acts to block Notch either directly, via the Abruptex domain (Wesley and Saez, 2000) (1-2) or, more likely, indirectly by stimulating Dsh to block GSK3 or to circumvent Deltex/Notch interaction (or both; 1',2').
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Interference with Notch/Deltex activity by Dsh requires the Dsh-binding region of Notch; deletions of this region and some Abruptex mutations render Notch a constitutive repressor of neural competence (2') (Ramain et al.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Removal of both Notch and wingless restores competence, suggesting that the only role of Wnt in acquisition of neural or myogenic competence is to antagonize Notch.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	66	It is clear that not all the proteins facilitating inhibition of competence have been described.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	67	 There is at this time no biochemical mechanism proposed for this process.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Similar Wnt/Notch interactions in other organisms are yet to be discovered, casting doubt on the generality of these observations.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	69	 The importance of the Abruptex mutations was recognized early   the name was given even before it was realized that locus is identical to Notch   but a biochemical explanation for the complex genetic behavior of Abruptex mutations is still lacking.
0.43437973.11884509.html.plaintext.txt	70	 These recent observations may begin to provide an answer.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Presenilin 1 or presenilin 2, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 form high molecular weight complexes that play a pivotal role in the cleavage of various Type I transmembrane proteins, including the -amyloid precursor protein.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The specific function of PEN-2 is unclear.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To explore its function and intermolecular interactions, we conducted deletion and mutagenesis studies on a series of conserved residues at the C terminus of PEN-2.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These studies suggest that: 1) both the presence and amino acid sequence of the conserved DYLSF domain at the C terminus of PEN-2 (residues 90 to 94) is critical for binding PEN-2 to other components in the presenilin complex and 2) the overall length of the exposed C terminus is critical for functional -secretase activity.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The presenilin proteins (PS1 and PS2) are evolutionarily conserved polytopic transmembrane proteins that are required for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of several Type 1 transmembrane proteins including the -amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 Notch receptor, and p75 (1 to 4).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Several different lines of evidence have revealed that the presenilins form high molecular weight complexes with at least three other proteins (APH-1, PEN-2, and nicastrin) (5 to 9) and that all of these other proteins are required for functional intramembranous proteolytic activity (10).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	11	 As a result, null mutations or suppression of the expression of these genes results in loss of regulated intramembranous endoproteolysis of APP (termed -secretase cleavage), Notch (termed S3 cleavage), and the other Type 1 transmembrane protein substrates.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Conversely, clinical missense mutations in PS1 and PS2 that are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (11, 12) and selected experimental missense mutations in nicastrin (6) can all alter presenilin-dependent -secretase cleavage of APP, leading to overproduction of longer proteolytic derivatives of APP termed amyloid -peptide (A).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	13	PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2) was initially identified during a genetic screen for modifiers of the presenilin homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans (SEL-12 and HOP-1) (8).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Subsequent studies confirmed that it is a component of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes and that its presence within these complexes is necessary for their maturation and activity (8, 13, 14).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Thus, loss of PEN-2 activity is associated with reduced presenilin levels (8, 15, 16), reduced presenilin endoproteolysis (13, 17, 18), and loss of regulated intramembranous proteolytic (-/S3 cleavage) activity (8).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of PEN-2 provides no clue as to its function.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, the protein is predicted to have two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (19, 20).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	18	 There are also a series of residues at the hydrophilic C terminus (residues 90 to 101) that are conserved during evolution and that we hypothesize are functionally important (see Fig.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In contrast to the profound loss-of-function effects of the AAAAA and del90 to 94 mutants, mutation of only one or two residues of the DYLSF domain caused variable but milder reductions in nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis and A secretion (Figs.

0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	146	  Despite the fact that the del96 to 101 mutant binds more efficiently to other presenilin complex components than do the remaining PEN-2 deletion mutations, the del96 to 101 mutant only partially rescued presenilin complex maturation and function (with activity being equivalent to that of the other deletion mutations).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	147	 We reasoned that this reduced rescue activity of the del96 to 101 mutant despite its only mild reduction in binding could occur if there are specific residues in the 96 to 101 domain that are critical for PEN-2 activity.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	148	 There are three highly conserved residues in this domain: Ile at codon 96, Pro at codon 97, and Gly at codon 99.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	149	 An alternate possibility is that the absolute length of the C terminus is critical to the function of PEN-2, and this deletion (and all of the other deletions) has altered this property.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This latter possibility is supported by the prior report that exogenous wild-type C-terminally tagged PEN-2 failed to complement loss-of-function alleles in the C.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	151	 elegans PEN-2 gene (8) and by our earlier observation that PEN-2 constructs tagged with C-terminal Myc epitopes were unstable (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	152	 To resolve this dichotomy, we made three constructs: one with alanine missense mutations at all three conserved residues, one with a four-residue (KDAS) C-terminal addition, and one with a deletion of the two non-conserved C-terminal residues, AAA (IPG), KDAS, and del100 to 101, respectively (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Immunoprecipitation experiments following transient expression of these constructs in PEN-2 knock-down HEK293 cells revealed that the AAA (IPG) mutant bound to the other presenilins complex components comparably with that of wild-type PEN-2.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, the KDAS and the del100 to 101 mutant had a moderate reduction in binding that was similar in magnitude to the reduction in binding of the del96 to 101 mutant (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	155	 6, lane 15 for del100 to 101; not shown for KDAS).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	156	 As would be expected from these binding assays, transient expression of the AAA (IPG) mutant nearly completely rescued both nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion, whereas the KDAS and the del100 to  101 mutant had minimal effect (Figs.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	157	 8, lanes 14, 15, and 18, and 9A, lanes 14, 15, and 18).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	158	 These data indicate that, in addition to the sequence and size of the conserved DYLSF motif at residues 90 to 94, another critical factor for nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis is the length of the C terminus (Fig.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	159	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Our data reveal that PEN-2 plays a role in nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and A secretion and are in agreement with several previous reports (8, 15, 16).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, our data also reveal that the C terminus is important in: 1) modulating the interaction of PEN-2 with the other presenilin complex components, 2) supporting nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis, and 3) supporting A secretion.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Our intensive mutation analysis suggests that both the sequence of the DYLSF domain and the absolute length of the C terminus are important for these activities.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	162	The deletion mutants, and to a lesser degree the individual missense mutations of the DYLSF domain, affect the binding of PEN-2 to the presenilin complex (and as a result they also affect presenilin complex assembly, maturation, and -secretase activity to an equivalent degree).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	163	 On the other hand, modulation of the length (but not the sequence) of the exposed extreme C terminus of PEN-2 has less impact on PEN-2 binding to the complex but does have a significant affect on presenilin complex maturation and -secretase activity.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We interpret these findings to mean that: 1) the amino acid sequence of the DYLSF domain is important for the physical binding of PEN-2 to the other presenilin complex components and 2) the absolute length of the C terminus is important for PEN-2 activity within functional presenilin complexes.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	165	The DYLSF domain has no conserved homology by BLAST database search.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	166	 However, the YLSF sequence matches the tyrosine-based sorting signal (YXX[LMVIF]) in the cytoplasmic tail of several proteins including the mu subunit of the AP (adaptor protein) complex, TGN38, epidermal growth factor receptor, mannose 6-phosphate receptor, and furin (25 to 28).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The tyrosine-based sorting motifs in these proteins are responsible for targeting these proteins to various organelles (25 to 28).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Although the YLSF motifs in these examples work in the cytoplasm, it is conceivable that the DYLSF domain of PEN-2 could also be involved in targeting PEN-2 to nascent presenilin complexes or may simply be a binding motif required for the interaction of PEN-2 with other proteins in the PS1 complex.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	169	The fact that the absolute length (but not the sequence) of the C terminus of PEN-2 is critical for presenilin complex function but does not affect binding of PEN-2 to the complex suggests that the C terminus may be involved in maintaining non-sequence-based spatial interactions (e.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	170	 spatial packing) with other components of the presenilin complex.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A similar critical sensitivity to the length of the C terminus has been reported for both PS1 and PS2 (29).
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Because the C termini of both PS1/PS2 and PEN-2 are oriented in the cytoplasm, additional experiments will be needed to discern whether the C termini of these two proteins in fact interact, whether directly with each other or with a third protein.
0.45364788.15322109.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, taken together these data raise the possibility that PEN-2 might function as an important linker/spacer molecule that maintains spatial interactions between various presenilin complex components.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	40	 At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	 They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	46	35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35).

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE (from January 1994 to September 2003).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The search strategy was based on combinations of "Alzheimer s disease," "CTSD," "cathepsin D," "polymorphism," "allele," and "genetics.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	51	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	54	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	56	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	60	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	63	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	64	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	70	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Finally, we evaluated whether the summary results were different when the analysis was limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls (those that clearly performed neuropsychological testing for all controls).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	73	Previous investigations have alluded to the possibility that the T allele may interact with the APOE*4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (7, 9).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, we also evaluated the effect of T allele carriage on the risk of Alzheimer s disease separately for APOE*4-positive and APOE*4-negative subjects.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Moreover, we evaluated the genetic effect conferred by the presence of APOE*4 separately in subjects carrying the T allele and those not carrying the T allele.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Odds ratios were combined with fixed and random effects models, as described above.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Two studies (7, 16) mentioned that they included cases with a family history of Alzheimer s disease, eight studies (9 to 14, 18, 19) specifically excluded such patients, and the remaining did not clarify the background of family history.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	88	 One study (6) mentioned that 61 percent of Alzheimer s disease cases had late-onset disease (age of onset:  > 65 years), five studies (8, 12 to 14, 19) specifically included only late-onset Alzheimer s disease cases, one study (18) specifically excluded such patients, and the remaining did not clarify the age at onset.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Controls did not have a diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease, but the amount of additional screening (general physical and neurologic examination, psychiatric interview, neuropsychological testing, blood and cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and Mini-Mental State Examination score) to exclude Alzheimer s disease differed substantially across studies.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The current evidence cannot exclude that the T allele of the CTSD polymorphism may increase modestly the risk of Alzheimer s disease, but there was significant heterogeneity in the results of various studies.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, we found that bias might exist, with a decreasing effect size, as more data accumulated over time.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Moreover, the meta-analysis also cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the CTSD T allele may enhance the increased susceptibility toward Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	159	 However, even if this is true, it would pertain to the relatively small group of subjects who carry both the APOE*4 and CTSD T alleles.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In all, the impact of the T allele on a population level would be small, if present at all.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	163	 One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3).

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	166	Attention should be given to the design of individual studies.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The results of meta-analyses may be affected by methodological problems and potential biases in the designs of the constituent studies.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Nondifferential misclassification errors may dilute the strength of an observed association.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Alzheimer s disease cases were generally selected according to appropriate criteria.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Studies of younger subjects may be more suitable for identifying risk factors that result in early onset Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Conversely, selection of younger subjects may be less appropriate, if the influence of the postulated genetic risk factor is more important in late-onset Alzhei-mer s disease.

0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Our analyses addressed interactions with APOE*4, the major known genetic determinant of Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	184	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation.
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Even when genetic associations are replicated, usually they do not have a major public health impact that would lead to screening recommendations (53).
0.5697466.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Nevertheless, such knowledge could improve our understanding about the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Alzheimer s disease.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	6	Abstract Millions of patients suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and intensive efforts to find a cure for this devastating disorder center on the proteases, which release the deadly amyloid ss-peptide from its precursor.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The cutting procedure is thought to be cholesterol dependent and strategies to lower cholesterol as therapeutic treatment are under intensive investigation.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Recent findings suggest that the complete proteolytic machinery required for amyloid ss-peptide generation is located within lipid rafts.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Data by Dotti and colleagues (Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	10	, 2004), in this issue, suggest that rafts isolate the cutting machinery away from its deadly substrate.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These findings describe a novel mechanism for controlling proteolytic activity by building a lipid boundary between proteases and their substrates.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	12	Abbreviations used in this paper: Ass, amyloid ss-peptide; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, ss-amyloid precursor protein.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	13	In all developed countries, humans live longer and longer.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although we all wish to enjoy increased longevity, a longer life is unfortunately associated with a dramatic increase for the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	15	 This has been widely recognized for years and numerous scientists have studied the cellular mechanisms causing AD with the goal of finally identifying targets for treatment.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Indeed, it is likely that all genes directly involved in the generation of the deadly amyloid ss-peptide (Ass), which forms the disease-defining amyloid plaques, have now been identified (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Currently, it is clear that Ass is generated by proteolytic processing of ss-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and two amyloidogenic secretases, ss- and -secretase, are involved (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The ss-secretase, ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), is a typical aspartyl protease.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	19	 -Secretase, however, is an unusual aspartyl protease complex composed of four individual proteins (presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2), with presenilin carrying the protease active site (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	20	 -Secretase is uncommon not only in its molecular composition but also in its proteolytic activity, since it is able to cleave its substrate within the membrane (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	21	 A prerequisite of this intramembrane cut is the release of the ectodomain of APP via cleavage by BACE or -secretase.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Removal of the ectodomain by BACE results in the production of Ass following -secretase cleavage, whereas ectodomain cleavage by -secretase is nonamyloidogenic since it cuts within the Ass domain (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	23	View larger version (23K):    Figure 1.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Processing of APP by secretases.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	25	 -Secretase cleavage occurs within the Ass domain and prevents amyloidogenesis.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	26	 However, a small peptide (p3) is generated by the subsequent cleavage of the C83 fragment by -secretase.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Besides p3, the large ectodomain (APPs-) is secreted.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A shorter APPs species is secreted upon cleavage by BACE (APPs-ss).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The resulting C99 fragment is cleaved by -secretase to produce Ass.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The -secretase cut releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which may be involved in nuclear signaling.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	31	  Amyloidogenesis is known to be dependent on cholesterol levels (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	32	, 2001), and moreover, this seems to have a direct relevance for AD, since high cholesterol is correlated with an increased risk for the disease (Kuo et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, the apolipoprotein 4 allele is known as a major genetic risk factor for AD (Corder et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	34	 At the cellular level, Ass generation was found to occur in special cholesterol-rich membrane subdomains called DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes), and lowering cholesterol levels by treatment with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, statins, resulted in a strong decrease in Ass production (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	35	 This is likely due in part to an increase in nonamyloidogenic cleavage by -secretase (Kojro et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In animal models, statin treatment was also associated with a significant drop in Ass load (Fassbender et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Furthermore, a clear correlation between cholesteryl-ester levels and Ass generation was reported in cultured cells (Puglielli et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	38	 More recently, it was demonstrated that inhibition of the enzyme that regulates the conversion of free cholesterol into cholesteryl-esters not only leads to a dramatic lowering of AD pathology in animal models but is also associated with a reversion of cognitive deficits (Hutter-Paier et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Not surprisingly, efforts are under way to use cholesterol-lowering drugs in patients to decrease Ass production.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Indeed, preliminary epidemiological studies and small clinical trials suggest that lowering cholesterol levels may reduce the risk for AD (Wolozin et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	41	The strong cholesterol dependency of Ass generation suggested that secretases might be located within DRMs and this may regulate the processing of APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	42	 (2003) demonstrated that antibody cross-linking induced BACE and APP to copatch within cholesterol-rich microdomains, and this resulted in increased Ass production.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This proposed localization of secretases is supported by the recent findings of two different laboratories.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	44	 (2004) report that they were able to identify endogenous BACE within DRMs of primary hippocampal neurons.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	45	 (2004) recently demonstrated that the completely assembled, biologically active -secretase complex consisting of the presenilin fragments APH-1, mature Nicastrin, and PEN-2 resides within DRMs.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Moreover, -secretase was found in syntaxin 6 to , syntaxin 13 to , and VAMP4-positive vesicles, demonstrating that -secretase accumulates in the DRMs of late Golgi and endosomes (Vetrivel et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	47	, 2004), exactly where BACE is thought to be biologically active (Haass et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Similarly, monomeric and oligomeric Ass were concentrated in DRMs in the brains of a mouse model for AD (Lee et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, it appears that the complete Ass generating proteolytic machinery coexists within DRMs of the same vesicles.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	50	In this issue, the researchers provide a novel and unexpected explanation for why secretases are localized to cholesterol rich membrane domains.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	51	 They present data suggesting that the DRM association of BACE restricts its access to APP, which they demonstrate accumulates in detergent sensitive membrane domains outside of DRMs (see Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This may indicate aberrant access of APP to DRMs, and hence aberrant Ass production, during AD or it may indicate that even under physiological conditions some APP molecules come into close contact with DRMs.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The latter seems more likely, since Ass is a physiologically normal product and not produced just in the brains of AD patients (Haass, 2004).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These findings also demonstrate a completely novel cellular mechanism for controlling protease activity.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Cells undergo major efforts to prevent proteases from contacting proteins not destined to be digested.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This is accomplished by numerous mechanisms including synthesis of inactive proforms to be activated at appropriate sites, tagging protease substrates with ubiquitin, sequestering proteases in membrane surrounded environments (endosomes/lysosomes), or hiding the active sites of proteases within narrow tunnels (proteasomes).
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	57	 (2004) add yet another control mechanism.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	58	 They show that lipids can build an invisible boundary, corralling the -secretase complex and BACE away from their substrate, APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Certainly, this mechanism did not evolve to protect us from AD.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	60	 So why do the secretases concentrate within DRMs? A probable explanation is that -secretase is involved in several signaling pathways including Notch signaling (Selkoe and Kopan, 2003; Haass, 2004) and concentrating the proteolytic machinery in small membrane domains facilitates these processes.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	61	 This would, however, imply that physiological substrates such as Notch and others must gain access to DRMs, an observation yet to be made.

0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	64	  There is, however, one obvious discrepancy between the results of the current study and earlier ones that must be addressed.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	65	 (2004) demonstrate that, upon moderate lowering of cholesterol, Ass generation surprisingly increased, whereas a large body of previously published data (see above) clearly demonstrated reduced Ass generation upon cholesterol reduction.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	66	 How could that be the case, and does that mean that all previous approaches were simply wrong? The truth may be found on both sides.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The findings Dotti and colleagues (Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	68	, 2004) are indeed in apparent disagreement with studies showing that lowering cholesterol inhibits amyloidogenesis, both in cultured cells and in animal models (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, in these studies, cholesterol was always strongly depleted and the cells that were used overexpressed APP.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In contrast, the current study investigated neurons, the cells most affected by the deadly activity of Ass.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Moderate reduction of cholesterol led to increased Ass levels, whereas a strong cholesterol reduction resulted in a significant drop in Ass generation (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	72	 2), similar to that observed before (Simons et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Thus, the effects of cholesterol reduction are dose dependent, and two apparently independent cellular mechanisms are affected.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	74	 A moderate reduction in cholesterol causes a disorganization of DRMs, allowing more BACE to contact APP and resulting in enhanced Ass generation (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A strong reduction in cholesterol inhibits BACE/-secretase activity and results in a dramatic drop in Ass generation, even though BACE and -secretase can now contact APP directly (Fig.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In clear contrast to this model, Ehehalt et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	77	 reported that BACE cleavage of APP occurs within lipid DRMs (Ehehalt et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	78	, 2003), This discrepancy might be due to the fact that when overexpressed a fraction of APP may be mislocalized to DRMs, and then cleaved by BACE, an observation also made by Abad-Rodriguez et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	79	 More work is needed to settle this controversy since the effects of lowering brain cholesterol on the production of endogenous Ass in mouse neurons or in human brains have not been directly demonstrated.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Although the current findings raise some interesting questions, they do not necessarily challenge cholesterol-lowering tactics as AD therapy/prevention since animal studies to date are in clear favor of this strategy (Fassbender et al.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Moreover, cholesterol lowering drugs are taken by numerous patients with enormous beneficial effects on cardiovascular disorders and no side effects concerning Ass generation or dementia have been reported.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Cholesterol-dependent processing of APP provides a striking example how disease-based research can dramatically advance basic knowledge in cell biology, and vice versa.
0.33924845.15583026.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Who would have thought, only 10 years ago, that DRMs might contain and regulate the deadly machinery responsible for the most abundant human neurodegenerative disorder and that this machinery might function via a novel and totally unexpected mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis?.

0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received May 26, 1999; Accepted June 1, 1999.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	4	Despite being considered the archetypal non-genetic neurological disorder, genetic analysis of Parkinson's disease has shown that there are at least three genetic loci.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, these analyses have suggested that the phenotype of the pathogenic loci is wider than simple Parkinson's disease and may include Lewy body dementia and some forms of essential tremor.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Identification of [alpha]-synuclein as the first of the loci involved in Parkinson's disease and the identification of this protein in pathological deposits in other disorders has led to the suggestion that it may share pathogenic mechanisms with multiple system atrophy, Alzheimer's disease and prion disease and that these mechanisms are related to a synuclein pathway to cell death.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Finally, genetic analysis of the synuclein diseases and the tau diseases may indicate that this synuclein pathway is an alternative to the tau pathway to cell death.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	8	Parkinsonism is the term used to describe a constellation of clinical signs which includes resting tremor, rigidity, gait disturbance and postural instability, along with other `secondary' features.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The most common form of parkinsonism is Parkinson's disease (PD).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This disorder is pathologically characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies [intracellular inclusions staining with both [alpha]-synuclein and ubiquitin antibodies (1) in the brain stem], associated neuronal loss and notable depigmentation of the substantia nigra.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Importantly, Lewy bodies are also found in other diseases, such as some Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases (2) and some prion diseases (3).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As the eponym indicates, Lewy bodies are the hallmark pathological finding in Lewy body dementia (LBD) (4); whether this is a disease on one end of a spectrum of Lewy body diseases, including in its range PD and LBD, or is a distinct clinicopathological entity is the subject of current debate (discussed below).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Synuclein abnormalities also occur in the parkinsonian disorder multiple system atrophy (MSA).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In this disease there is abnormal oligodendroglial staining with synuclein antibodies, but no Lewy bodies (5).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Parkinsonism is also a feature of other diseases that are characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular lesions consisting of the tau protein).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These include: progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (6); bodig (Parkinson's dementia complex of Guam) (7); frontal-temporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (8).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, there are recessive disorders in which parkinsonism is a feature: these include `juvenile' parkinsonism (AR-JP, for which mutations in the parkin gene on chromosome 6 have been identified as responsible) (9); and lubag, an X-linked recessive parkinsonism-dystonia complex seen on the Philippine island of Panay (10).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These latter are not reviewed herein.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	19	The primary purpose of this article is to review recent progress in the genetics of those diseases in which synuclein pathology is a prominent feature.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, it is clear that both the etiology and clinical features overlap with those of diseases with tau pathology, so relevant recent information on these diseases will be briefly discussed.

0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	22	[alpha]-Synuclein deposits occur in many diseases: they are the predominant lesions in PD, LBD and MSA, and they are the secondary lesion in AD and some cases of prion disease (Fig.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In PD, LBD and MSA the synuclein pathology is the predominant and possibly primary pathology, whereas in AD and the prion diseases the synuclein pathology is, we will argue, secondary to other lesions that lead to extracellular protein deposition.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Synuclein pathology in PD, LBD and MSA.

0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	26	Genetics of the diseases in which [alpha]-synuclein deposits are the predominant pathology.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	27	PD was for many years considered the archetypal `non-genetic' disorder, however, a re-evaluation and meta-analysis of twin studies suggested that genetic factors had an important part to play (11).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Cross-sectional surveys have shown that early onset PD (arbitrarily designated as 12) (this issue is further discussed below).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, limited longitudinal evaluation of twins with late onset PD, by 18F-dopa positron emission tomography, suggests that cross-sectional studies are overlooking pre-symptomatic disease (13).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In addition, several families in which apparently autosomal dominant disease has been well-documented (14-19) offer the classic route to the identification of pathogenic loci.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	31	In 1996, Polymeropoulos and colleagues identified genetic linkage to Lewy body parkinsonism in the Contursi kindred (15,20).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The [alpha]-synuclein gene had previously been mapped into the region defined by the linkage study (21).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The following year they reported a mutation, A53T, which segregated with the disease in the family (22).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This mutation has subsequently been identified in several other families, all of whom are of Greek or Southern Italian origin, suggesting a founder effect (22,23).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A second mutation, A30P, has been described in a single family of German origin (24).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both [alpha]-synuclein mutations appear to be almost fully penetrant (22,23).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The identification of these pathogenic mutations was particularly interesting and surprising for two reasons.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	38	 First, because most species, including mouse, have a threonine at codon 53 and thus the pathogenic mutation can be thought of as a `revertant' (although there are other differences between the human and mouse sequence; 25).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Second, because a fragment of [alpha]-synuclein (the non-amyloid component of plaques, NAC) was suggested to be part of the pathology of AD, although this has not been confirmed (26).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The identification of [alpha]-synuclein as a gene for Lewy body parkinsonism led immediately to the realization that [alpha]-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (27).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	41	The normal function of [alpha]-synuclein is unknown (28); however, a role in synaptic transport of vesicles or in synaptic plasticity has been suggested (29).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	42	 It is not known whether the pathogenic mutations inhibit this function (although there is some suggestion that they might; 29).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	43	 However, in vitro data suggest that the mutant protein is more prone to fibrillogenesis (30-33).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This has led to the idea that fibrillogenesis of the mutant protein is the key feature which leads to pathogenesis.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	45	Most families multiply affected by Lewy body parkinsonism do not have a lesion in the [alpha]-synuclein gene (25).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Two other loci have been reported for Lewy body parkinsonism: the first on chromosome 2p (34) and the second on chromosome 4p (35).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These loci are not fully penetrant with respect to Lewy body parkinsonism; indeed, in both cases, it seems that only about half the gene carriers develop the disease (34,35).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Furthermore, it is also clear that even these three loci together ([alpha]-synuclein, ch2p and ch4p) do not account for the majority of the familial cases of Lewy body parkinsonism.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, ironically, it seems likely that there will be at least four, and probably more, genetic loci for a disease that was considered `non-genetic'.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	50	Multiple loci encoding the parkinsonian phenotype is one level of complexity in the genetics of this disorder, but the situation is, in fact, more complex than this in two related ways: first, the loci are non-penetrant; secondly, the neurodegenerative disease phenotype encompasses more than simple parkinsonism.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	51	Non-penetrance of PD loci and the occurrence of essential tremor as an alternative phenotype.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	52	All three genetic loci so far identified by linkage analysis are incompletely penetrant.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Part of the biological reason for this is probably that loss of ~70% of nigral neurons is required for expression of the parkinsonian phenotype (36).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, individuals with a loss of neurons of less than this amount will appear unaffected.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This is also, almost certainly, part of the reason why twin studies (which by their nature are largely cross-sectional) fail to show high degrees of concordancy in monozygotic twins (12; see ref.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	56	 13 for a discussion of this issue).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	57	 However, the fact that PD is a disease with a distinct clinical threshold is not the whole explanation of non-penetrance since, in the ch4p-encoded family, the onset of disease is typically ~40 years with death at 50 years, yet unaffected haplotype carriers have a normal life expectancy (16,17,35).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Thus, it seems likely that other factors, possibly also genetic, modify the expressivity of this locus.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Interestingly, and related to this, most of the haplotype carriers of the ch4p locus who do not develop neurodegenerative disease have essential tremor.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This is a relatively benign and non-progressive tremor clinically distinct from the resting tremor of PD (37).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	61	 While this is a surprising finding, it is not unprecedented, in that essential tremor has frequently been reported to occur more frequently in the relatives of individuals with PD (38,39).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	62	The relationship between PD and LBD: alternative phenotypes of the same process.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	63	As discussed briefly above, PD is a distinctive clinical entity whose symptoms are largely dependent on the lesion of the substantia nigra.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, Lewy body degeneration occurs in other parts of the brain in PD.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Furthermore, a proportion of individuals develop dementia in which their sole cortical pathology is the occurrence of Lewy bodies (4,40).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	66	 From a clinical perspective, this syndrome, LBD, consists of progressive dementia as the core feature, with fluctuations in cognition, hallucinations and parkinsonism.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Patients with LBD may be particularly prone to developing, or progressive severity of, parkinsonism, when exposed to neuroleptic medication and may be dramatically responsive to cholinesterase inhibitors.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The relationship between LBD and PD is not clear, largely because the etiologies of both disorders individually are unclear.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, the family in which the ch4p locus segregates includes some individuals who fit the clinical criteria for PD and others who fit the criteria for LBD (17; unpublished data).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Thus it is the authors' opinion that LBD and PD share the same etiology and pathogenic mechanisms and differ only in the neuronal populations affected by disease.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	71	MSA is a sporadic, late onset (typically 50-65 years) disease whose clinical presentation overlaps with PD, but in which autonomic failure is a pronounced feature and in which cerebellar signs such as ataxia may occur (41).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	72	 It is characterized by neuronal loss and by the occurrence of oligodendroglial inclusions; these inclusions stain positive for [alpha]-synuclein (42).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	73	 No risk factors, either genetic or environmental, have yet been identified for MSA.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	74	The genetics of the diseases in which [alpha]-synuclein is the secondary pathology.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	75	A well-established observation has been the occurrence of Lewy bodies in individuals with neuritic plaques, often in the absence or near absence of the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (2).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	76	 However, with the advent of molecular genetic analysis of families with AD, it has become clear that Lewy bodies occur in families with either amyloid precursor protein (APP) (43,44) or presenilin (44,45) mutations.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This indicates that in this circumstance Lewy body/synuclein pathology is a consequence of the primary pathology in APP processing.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This surprising observation has been extended to the prion diseases, in which, in those prion families in which neurofibrillary tangles were previously reported, the advent of synuclein antibodies has also revealed the occurrence of Lewy bodies (3,46).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In addition, with respect to AD at least, it seems as if the tangle/tau pathology and the Lewy body/synuclein pathology are alternative responses to the primary lesion, because cases of AD with little tau pathology have much synuclein pathology and vice versa (47).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	80	The genetics of the diseases with tau pathology.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	81	Neurofibrillary tangles are most frequently thought of in connection with AD, however, there is a long list of neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonism and tangle pathology (48).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Most notable are pathological data from chromosome 6q-linked juvenile onset parkinsonism (AR-JP) (9,49).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	83	 While devoid of Lewy body inclusions, there is prominent neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus with tau staining of neurofibrillary tangles in cerebral cortex and brainstem nuclei (50).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The number of different mutations described in the parkin gene will ultimately provide insight into both the protein's function and resultant clinical and pathological presentations.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Also of relevance to this review are FTDP-17 (51), in which the pathogenic mutations are within the tau gene (52,53), and PSP.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Work on FTDP-17 and the relationship between this disease and AD has recently been reviewed (54,55).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, progress on the etiology of PSP has occurred since these reviews and will thus be discussed herein.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	88	PSP is the second most common cause of parkinsonism (56).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	89	 It is characterized by the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of straight filaments comprising almost entirely of tau in which the deposited protein contains four microtubule-binding repeats (57).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In contrast, in AD both three and four repeat tau is deposited (54,55).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Families with multiple cases of PSP have not been convincingly demonstrated and thus genetic factors were not thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, Saitoh and colleagues showed a robust association between homozygosity of a common allele at a dinucleotide repeat marker and PSP that has been multiply confirmed (58).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Recently this association was shown to reflect the occurrence of common tau haplotypes that differ in gene structure, but not in protein coding sequence, and that homozygosity of the common allele (H1) predisposes to disease (59).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It is not yet clear whether there has been a mutation on the H1 background that predisposes to disease or whether the H1 haplotype itself is a `low penetrance' risk factor locus with a recessive mode of inheritance.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The absence of families with multiple cases of PSP would seem to provide evidence against the existence of a rare highly penetrant mutation that is associated with some versions of the H1 haplotype.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in PSP that are made of four repeat tau indicates that, whatever the pathogenic process in this disease, it results in the selective deposition of these isoforms.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This is similar to missense mutations and 5[prime] splice site mutations that affect exon 10 of the tau gene and which are associated with the development of FTDP-17.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Thus the most parsimonious explanation of the genetic data in PSP is that the H1 haplotype prediposes to the over-production of four repeat tau, which somehow initiates the pathogenic process.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	99	SUMMARY, SYNTHESIS AND SPECULATION.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	100	The clinical and pathological presentations of parkinsonism, both synucleinopathies and tauopathies, overlap and argue that the underlying defects may perturb relatively few common pathways for which there are a limited number of pathological responses (60).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	101	 One rationale to understand these disorders is to identify the underlying genetic influences that result in different synuclein pathologies, in PD, LBD and MSA.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Identifying the proteins, their interactions and the pathways affected will direct future epidemiological studies into environmental risk factors and the exploration of gene-environment interactions.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Our task is to: (i) delineate which genetic methods will be most powerful to identify the underlying molecular components; (ii) identify the normal function of the defective proteins implicated in disease; and (iii) understand how those proteins and pathways are regulated and integrated.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Despite the apparently low heritability suggested by cross-sectional twin studies (12), linkage analysis, with the caveats of reduced penetrance, variable expressivity and phenocopy, is proving a successful method with which to identify loci, genes and mutations leading to parkinsonism (8-10,20,22-24,34-35,49-53,57-59).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The proteins identified may also be central to idiopathic PD (1).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Limited family studies now suggest that the etiology of parkinsonism is multifactorial in which several susceptibility genes/mutations are involved.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Given this conclusion, it is not surprising (with the exception of PSP; 57-59) that the majority of case-control studies for candidate gene associations have not proved reproducible.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The problem lies not just with ascertainment or issues of misdiagnosis/under-diagnosis or in looking at the right candidate gene, but rather it is the underlying, naive assumption that disease in a sample is likely to originate from the same, common, founder mutation.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This may be true in isolated populations, such as Finland or Iceland, where linkage disequilibrium mapping has proven powerful in diseases with simple, single gene etiologies, but is unlikely to hold true for idiopathic PD and the majority of studies.
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	110	 From the limited components identified to date, it is possible to speculate that these proteins may functionally overlap in a common pathway of cytoskeletal maintenance and intracellular vesicle transport (20,22,28,29,51-53,58).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Identification of the susceptibility genes at ch2p, ch4p and other loci may lend support to this hypothesis (34,35).
0.34695634.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Hence, after >180 years, molecular genetic analysis of familial parkinsonism will finally allow us to refine the nosology that James Parkinson so carefully documented (61).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A proteolytic activity called -secretase cleaves APP in the transmembrane domain and is required for Ass generation.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Aberrant -secretase cleavage of APP underlies the majority of early onset, familial AD.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here we describe the generation of Drosophila that act as living reporters of -secretase activity in the fly eye.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In these reporter flies the size of the eye correlates with the level of endogenous -secretase activity, and is very sensitive to the levels of three genes required for APP -secretase activity, presenilin, nicastrin and aph-1.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, these flies provide a sensitized system with which to identify other components of the -secretase complex and regulators of its activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We have used these flies to carry out a screen for mutations that suppress -secretase activity and have identified a small chromosomal region that contains a gene or genes whose products may promote -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain that manifests as a decline of memory and other cognitive functions.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A critical pathogenic event leading to AD is the progressive accumulation of amyloid plaques consisting primarily of the amyloid ss peptide (Ass) (reviewed in 1,2).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Ass is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type 1 transmembrane protein, through the action of two proteolytic activities known as ss-secretase and -secretase (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The sequential action of ss-secretase, which cleaves APP in the extracellular domain, and -secretase, which cleaves APP within the transmembrane domain, generates Ass peptides and releases the intracellular domain of APP (AICD) from membrane association (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	16	 -Secretase generates two major Ass peptides of 40 or 42 to 43 residues in length, differing in the length of their C-termini.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The longer forms of Ass, Ass42 to 43, are prone to aggregate and are thought to seed the formation of amyloid plaques (reviewed in 3 to 5).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Understanding how -secretase-mediated APP cleavage is achieved is crucial to understand AD pathogenesis.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	19	 -Secretase also cleaves other signaling proteins within their transmembrane domains (reviewed in 6).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	20	 One of the most notable ones is Notch, a key transmembrane receptor that plays important roles in cell to cell communication both during development and in adulthood (reviewed in 7).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Cleavage of Notch by -secretase is essential for Notch function and this function of -secretase is evolutionarily conserved (6,7).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Expression of GMR to APP to GAL4/+ (C) or UAS to GRIM/+ (D), in isolation resulted in flies with wildtype-appearing eyes.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In contrast, Expression of both GMR to APP to GAL4 and UAS to GRIM (reporter) results in adult flies with small eyes (E), indicative of retinal cell death.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Retinal cell death present in the reporter flies is eliminated and eye size restored to normal by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor baculovirus p35 (F).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	36	  -Secretase activity resides in a large multi-protein complex (8), the exact molecular weight and composition of which is still being elucidated (reviewed in 9,10).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Recent observations indicate that the activity of four proteins, Presenilin, Nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, are necessary for -secretase activity (reviewed in 10).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The human genome encodes two Presenilins, Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Presenilins bind APP and probably provide the active catalytic core of -secretase or act as intimate cofactors (reviewed in 2,6,11 to 14).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	47	 This finding suggests that these four proteins are the minimal core components of the -secretase, although it does not exclude the possibility that factors in yeast may also contribute to formation of the active -secretase complex.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	48	 These four proteins regulate the stability and maturation of each other in tissue culture (19 to 26).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	49	 How this regulation occurs is unknown.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	50	 It is also unknown if other signaling pathways regulate -secretase activity by modifying the assembly or activity of these proteins.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	51	Drosophila -secretase and its four known components are functionally conserved.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Drosophila has an endogenous -secretase activity for APP and Notch (27), and its mechanism of action through formation of a high molecular weight complex with Presenilin is also conserved (28).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Drosophila has a single homolog each of presenilin (psn) (29 to 31), nicastrin (nct) (32 to 34), aph-1 and pen-2 (18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Loss of psn or nct function in Drosophila results in Notch-like phenotypes (32 to 37).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Removing aph-1 or pen-2 in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) culture cells via RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses -cleavage of both APP and Notch (18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Together, these observations indicate that the mechanisms by which APP cleavage occurs in flies, as well as the pathways by which this activity is regulated, are conserved with those of mammals.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	57	Genes that regulate -cleavage of APP have been isolated successfully through several approaches.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Positional cloning of familial AD genes resulted in identification of PS1 and PS2.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	61	 elegans and Drosophila for phenotypes that are suggestive of an alteration in -secretase activity provide an important complementary strategy for identifying new genes regulating -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	62	 elegans mutants with Notch-like or presenilin-like developmental defects identified the -secretase regulators aph-2 (nicastrin) (16), aph-1 and pen-2 (17,18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The advantage of the in vivo genetic approach is that it does not rely on direct physical binding to existing proteins such as Presenilins, and thus will not be limited by the low affinity or abundance of important interacting components.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In addition, it has the potential to identify components of the regulatory pathways of -secretase activity that may not bind to Presenilin.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Below, we describe a reporter that allows determination of the endogenous levels of -secretase activity in an easy to visualize, nonessential neuronal tissue, the adult fly eye.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This reporter is designed to identify changes in -cleavage of APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	67	 This is in contrast to previous C.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	68	 elegans and Drosophila-based screens which used presenilin and Notch mutant phenotypes during development as surrogate markers (16 to 18).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, we describe results from a screen utilizing these flies that identified a small region on the second chromosome containing one or more genes whose products may promote APP -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	70	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   A reporter for APP -secretase activity in living flies As outlined in Figure 1B, we generated transgenic flies expressing a chimeric type-1 transmembrane protein that serves as a -secretase substrate.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The N-terminus of the protein has a cleavable signal sequence which is followed by a fragment of human APP just C-terminal to the ss-secretase cleavage site.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The yeast transcription factor GAL4 is appended to the APP C-terminus.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	73	 This protein, known as APP to GAL4, is targeted to the secretory pathway by the N-terminal signal sequence.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Cotranslational cleavage of this signal sequence as APP is inserted into the membrane generates a protein that is C-terminal to the ss-secretase cleavage site.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	75	 We specifically expressed APP to GAL4 in the eye under the control of the eye-specific GMR promoter (38).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The reporter flies also carry a -secretase reporter output construct that consists of a GAL4-responsive transcriptional cassette driving the expression of the Drosophila cell death activator GRIM (39).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In the absence of -secretase, GAL4 remains tethered at the membrane and therefore is unable to enter the nucleus and activate transcription.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In the presence of -secretase activity, cleavage of APP releases from the membrane a fragment consisting of the intracellular domain of APP (AICD) and GAL4.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	79	 This fragment migrates to the nucleus and activates GRIM transcription, thereby promoting cell death in the eye (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Cells and organisms that act as reporters for caspase family proteases, as well as Notch or APP -secretase activity, have been generated previously (40 to 43).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In these reporters a proteolytic cleavage event is linked to the transcriptional activation of a reporter such as LacZ or luciferase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Our strategy utilizes retinal cell death as a readout to generate a visible and quantifiable eye phenotype in living animals, and hence facilitates in vivo genetic screens.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	83	Flies expressing GMR to APP to GAL4 alone have wildtype-appearing eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	84	 1C), as do flies carrying only UAS to GRIM (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In contrast, flies expressing both GMR to APP to GAL4 and UAS to GRIM (referred to hereafter as the reporter flies) have small eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Importantly, the reporter small eye phenotype was completely suppressed when reporter flies also expressed under GMR control the potent cell death and caspase inhibitor baculovirus p35 (38) (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	87	 1F), or the Drosophila cell death and caspase inhibitor DIAP1 (44) (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These observations indicate that the reporter small eye phenotype is strictly due to GRIM-induced caspase-dependent cell death, and not the result of developmental defects or the activation of other signal transduction pathways by the cleaved APP to GAL4 reporter protein.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	89	The -secretase reporter flies act as a useful genetic background in which to carry out screens for -secretase regulators (see below).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Any screen, genetic or chemical, generates false positives, i.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	91	 mutations that act as modifiers but that are not interesting for the project at hand.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In our case sources of such modifiers include mutations that affect the efficiency of GMR- or GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation, or the efficacy of GRIM-dependent cell death signaling.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	93	 We intended to use GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM to eliminate these false positives.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, since GMR to GAL4, UAS to GRIM flies are lethal, we chose to utilize two strains of flies that act as reporters for false positives.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The first strain is GMR to GRIM which expresses GRIM directly under GMR control and has small eyes (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The second strain is GMR-GAL4, UAS-GRIM G/REAPER (45).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This chimeric protein, G/REAPER, has the N-terminus of Grim, and the C-terminus of a second cell death activator, Reaper (Rpr) (46).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	98	 GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR flies also have a small eye phenotype, due to induction of caspase-dependent cell death (45) (Fig.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	99	 True modifiers of -secretase activity should alter the eye size of reporter flies, but not those of the false positive reporter flies.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	100	 False positives, on the other hand, should modify eye size similarly in the presence of both the reporter and false positive reporters.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	101	 As an example of the latter, reduction in the levels of glass, which encodes a transcription factor that drives GMR-dependent expression (47), results in suppression of the small eye phenotype of reporter flies, as well as those of the false positive reporters (data not shown).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Df(2L)3910 (23A6-B1) also removes aph-1.

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	182	 This possibility is not uninteresting.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	183	 AICD has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, and evidence suggests that it can participate in multiple cell-biological processes (reviewed in 9,48).

0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	186	 However, these genes are thought to account for as little as 30% of the genetic variance in AD susceptibility (5), indicating important regulators remain to be identified.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Because the pathogenesis of AD results from increased deposition of Ass, it seems likely that components or regulators of -secretase activity are among these.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	188	Here we described the generation of flies that function as living reporters for APP -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In these flies, -secretase-dependent cleavage of an APP-tethered transcription factor (a protease substrate), expressed specifically in the developing eye, leads to transcriptional activation of a cell death activator, Grim.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Thus, the levels of endogenous -secretase activity are read out as a function of Grim-dependent cell death, which manifests itself as flies that have decreased eye size.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The Drosophila eye is particularly useful as a screening system for regulators of -secretase activity since its cell population is dominated by neurons, and the eye is dispensable for viability and fertility.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Importantly, the reporter small eye phenotype is easily quantifiable, and is regulated in a dose-dependent manner by modest changes (roughly 2-fold) in the levels of psn, nct and aph-1, which encode known components of the -secretase-containing complex.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Thus, these flies constitute a very sensitized background in which to carry out genetic screens for other regulators of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	194	It is important to point out that it is not surprising that modest changes in the levels of -secretase components (2-fold reductions associated with heterozygosity) alter the reporter eye phenotype, but have no effect on -secretase-dependent developmental processes in the eye, such as Notch signaling.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Our reporter is specifically designed to be sensitive to, and to be able to report on, levels of -secretase activity within the normal physiologic range.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Thus, the reporter flies have been engineered to display a dominant eye phenotype in response to wild-type levels of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	197	 This is brought about in several different ways.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The reporter protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence that is removed cotranslationally, generating a protein that has the N-terminus of ss-secretase-cleaved APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Therefore, in contrast to endogenous substrates, the reporter protein does not require -or ss-secretase cleavage in order to become a suitable substrate for -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To the extent that these prior cleavage events are rate-limiting, the reporter will become the preferred substrate.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In addition, in the reporter flies APP to GAL4 is expressed at high levels, probably much higher than those of endogenous -secretase substrates such as Notch.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Therefore, it is likely that the reporter protein becomes, on a molar basis, the dominant substrate.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Finally, the output of our reporter, cell death in the eye, requires GAL4-dependent transcriptional activation from the UAS to GRIM element.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Five optimized GAL4 binding sites are present in this construct (49), thereby conferring a significant level of transcription-dependent amplification.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In this sensitized background modest changes in the level of -secretase activity brought about by changes in the levels of its components would be expected to result in modification of the eye phenotype.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	206	 In contrast to this engineered situation, heterozygosity for almost all genes in the fly genome (including psn, nct, and aph-1) does not result in observable phenotypes during normal development because the residual 50% gene activity is sufficient to mediate normal signaling within and between cells.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In other words, endogenous cellular signaling pathways such as Notch are normally buffered against phenotypic variability in response to modest changes in the activity of genes required for Notch processing (reviewed in 50).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	208	The -secretase reporter flies were designed to identify factors that regulate -secretase cleavage.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	209	 However, it is important to note that several other sorts of interesting modifiers may be identified.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These include factors that influence the stability and subcellular localization of APP to GAL4, AICD and -secretase components.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	211	 They could also include factors that regulate proteolysis of the reporter outside the -secretase target site.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	212	 In particular, regulators of a recently identified -cleavage which is C-terminal to the -cleavage site and is also regulated by Psn (51 to 54) may also be detected.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Many of these factors would be of potential relevance to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease mechanisms.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	214	This reporter has several advantages for conducting genome-wide genetic screens.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	215	 First, the small eye phenotype of the reporter flies acts as a readout of the endogenous, physiological levels of -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This stands in contrast to the situation with many eye-based dominant modifier screens, in which the sensitized background results from hyperactivation of a signaling pathway (55).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus modification of the reporter small eye phenotype by genetic manipulations or chemical compounds directly reflects modifications of the endogenous, physiologically relevant level of -secretase activity.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Second, this reporter allows us to conduct screens that are focused specifically on identifying genes that regulate cleavage of APP.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	219	 It makes no assumption about the role of psn in -secretase function, and thus constitutes an unbiased approach to identifying factors regulating APP processing.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Again, this stands in contrast to screens focused on identifying genes that use Notch or psn loss-of-function phenotypes during development as a surrogate marker.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Third, the sensitivity of the reporter allows us to conduct F1-dominant modifier screens.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	222	 Since a large number of flies can be screened in a short period of time (F1, first generation), this sets the stage for a genome-wide search for mutations affecting -secretase.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Moreover, disruption of one copy of almost all genes in the fly genome leads to flies that are viable and fertile.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Thus, a function of these genes can be tested for even though homozygous deletion of the gene might be lethal earlier in development.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Finally, the reporter flies are also useful for exploring the roles of candidate genes in -secretase regulation.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In particular, the fact that levels of specific genes in the eyes of reporter flies can be selectively decreased using GMR-RNAi constructs, as illustrated here for nct and aph-1, provides a rapid method to test candidate -secretase regulators in a neural tissue in vivo.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	227	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Constructs and transgenes The APP to GAL4 coding sequence contains a cleavable signal sequence followed by a C-terminal fragment of human APP (56) that initiates immediately downstream of ss-cleavage site, residue 671, and that also lacks a stop codon.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	228	 GAL4 (57), was appended to the C-terminus of APP, generating APP to GAL4.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	229	Residue D278 in Drosophila Psn corresponds to one of two evolutionarily conserved aspartate residues located in putative transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (29).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	230	 Mutation of either of these conserved residues to alanine in mammalian PS1 creates a protein with dominant negative activity (58).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	231	 We generated a dominant negative version of Drosophila Psn (Psn-D278A) from a psn cDNA, LD25307, obtained from Research Genetics, using the Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Psn-D278A was introduced into the GMR vector, generating GMR to Psn to D278A.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	233	GMR-driven nct and aph-1 RNAi constructs were generated following a strategy that results in transcription of sense and antisense strands of a transgene expressed under GMR control (59).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	234	 A similar strategy has been developed to drive double-stranded RNA production under UAS control (60).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	235	 A fragment of Drosophila nct (coding region residues 291 to 696) or aph-1 (coding region amino acid residues 29 to 174) was introduced between two GMR promoter sequences oriented in opposite directions in the vector PCasper, generating GMR-RNAi-nct and GMR-RNAi-aph-1, respectively.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	236	 To ensure that the RNAi effect was specific to the transgene in question, transgenic flies containing GMR to RNAi to nct, which suppresses the small eye phenotype of the GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM reporter, were crossed to flies with small eyes due to expression of GMR to GRIM, GMR to REAPER (RPR) or GMR to HID (44,61).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The small eye phenotypes of these flies was not suppressed (data not shown).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	238	Transformants were generated using standard microinjection (62) procedures in 0 to 1 h w1118 embryos.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Multiple transgenic lines were obtained in each microinjections.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	240	 For each experiment, at least four different insertion lines were tested.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	241	Fly strains and genetics Drosophila strains were raised on standard cornmeal-yeast agar medium at 25 degrees C, except for the GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/REAPER stock, which was raised at room temperature (20 degrees C).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Alleles used in this study were as follows: psnC1 and psnC2 from Struhl (35); nctJ2, nctJ1 and nctA7 from Fortini (33); GMR to G/REAPER (45) from Nambu; GMR to P35 (38) and GMR-DIAP1 (44).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	243	Flies carrying one copy of GMR to APP to GAL4 and one copy of UAS to GRIM on the same chromosome were generated by meiotic recombination.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The resulting GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM chromosome was balanced over CyO.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	245	 GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM flies were crossed into different genetic backgrounds and the appropriate progeny compared with the progeny of GMR to APP to GAL4, UAS to GRIM outcrossed to w1118, the background stock into which the GMR-driven transgenes were introduced.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Similar crosses were carried out with the two false positive reporters, GMR to GRIM and GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	247	 All crosses were carried out at 25 degrees C, except those involving GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR, which were carried out at room temperature (20 degrees C).
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	248	A group of stocks (the deficiency kit) that together delete, one piece at a time, a large fraction of the second chromosome, was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	249	 These lines were crossed to reporter flies.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	250	 Reporter progeny carrying one copy of the deficiency chromosome were examined for suppression of the reporter small eye phenotype.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	251	 Those deficiencies that tested positive in this assay were further characterized in similar crosses to the false positive reporter strains GMR to GRIM and GMR to GAL4, UAS to G/RPR.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	252	Scanning electron microscopy For some samples flies were dehydrated in an ethanol series, incubated overnight in hexamethyldisilazane (Sigma), and air dried prior to being analyzed using a Hitachi scanning electron microscopy.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	253	 For others, flies were quickly frozen at -80 degrees C, then mounted and analyzed directly.
0.5120089.12944419.html.plaintext.txt	254	 Both methods of preparation gave identical results.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	4	It is an aphorism that basic biological research lays the groundwork for solving important biomedical problems.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, the reverse is true as well: focusing on problems of human disease can lead to important new insights into the intricacies of nature.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 provides a case study for the latter, where the race to identify molecular players involved in pathogenesis has unveiled some unexpected and fascinating aspects of protease biochemistry and proteolysis-dependent signal transduction.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The 40-42-residue amyloid- peptide (A) is implicated in the early pathogenic events that lead to AD, and this peptide is carved out of the amyloid- precursor protein (APP) by - and -secretases (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These two proteases are considered such important drug targets that the search for inhibitors of A production within pharmaceutical companies has gone on for years even though both - and -secretases remained unknown until very recently.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Last year, -secretase was identified as a new membrane-tethered member of the aspartyl protease family (2-6), a finding that should greatly facilitate drug discovery.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	10	 -Secretases, which prevent A formation by cleaving in the middle of the amyloid domain (7), have now been shown to be members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) (8, 9).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	11	 At the same time, the mysterious -secretase is giving up its secrets as well.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Several different missense mutations in the APP gene on chromosome 21 cause familial AD (FAD), and these mutations are found immediately near the -, -, or -secretase processing sites.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	27	 A Lys  Asn/Met  Leu double mutation near the -secretase cleavage site found in a Swedish pedigree leads to increased A production (both A40 and A42) (12), and indeed purified -secretase cuts peptide substrates with the "Swedish mutation" better than peptides based on the wild-type sequence (2, 4, 6).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The several FAD-causing mutations in APP near the -secretase processing site also affect A production, but in these cases the mutations alter the specificity of the protease, leading to increases in the 42-residue A variant (13, 14).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These findings bolstered the "amyloid hypothesis" of AD pathogenesis, because A42 is particularly prone to fibril formation (15) and is the protein initially deposited in the neuritic plaques that characterize the disease (16).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Genes encoding the polytopic presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively, were later identified as major loci for FAD (17, 18), and mutations in the presenilins were likewise found to increase A42 production in transfected cell lines (19-21), transgenic animals (19, 20, 22), and human plasma (23).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, presenilins somehow modulate -secretase activity.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In fact, deletion of PS1 in mice dramatically reduced -secretase activity (24), and knockout of both PS1 and PS2 resulted in complete abolition of this APP processing event (25, 26), demonstrating that presenilins are absolutely required for proteolysis by -secretase.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	33	-Secretase carries out an unusual proteolysis within the middle of the predicted transmembrane domain of its substrates, C99, generated by -secretase, and C83, generated through alternative processing by -secretase (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Indeed, a helical conformation of the -secretase cleavage site in APP can explain why nearby FAD-causing mutations specifically increase A42 production; these mutations are immediately adjacent to the amide bond processed to give A42 (27).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A phenylalanine-scanning study near the -secretase cleavage site and the resulting effects on A40 and A42 production provided important experimental support for the idea that the substrate is in a helical conformation upon initial interaction with the protease (28).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Other mutagenesis studies likewise indicated that -secretase has loose sequence specificity (29-31).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	37	Despite the loose sequence specificity, -secretase nevertheless appears to process its substrate APP at specific sites.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This apparent paradox can be resolved by considering distance within the membrane as a key determinant of the site of proteolysis, a concept that together with the helical model suggests that -secretase might catalyze an intramembranous proteolysis.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The development of substrate-based inhibitors led to further indirect characterization of -secretase; inhibition by peptidomimetic transition-state analogues suggested an aspartyl protease mechanism (27).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Moreover, -secretase appears to have loose sequence specificity for its peptidomimetic inhibitors as it displays for its substrates (27).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Distinctions are observed for the ability of a given compound to block A40 vis-a-vis A42, leading to the suggestion that these two A species are generated by different -secretases (32, 33).

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	44	The findings that PS mutations affect A42 generation and that PS knockouts prevent A production raised the question if presenilins are identical with the -secretases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Presenilins appear to bear no obvious sequence homology with known proteases, and their homology to Spe-4, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein apparently involved in vesicle transport in spermatozoa, initially suggested a less direct role in -secretase processing of APP (17).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Furthermore, overexpression of presenilins does not lead to increased -secretase activity (20).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, presenilins themselves undergo proteolytic processing within the hydrophobic region of the large cytosolic loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 6 and TM 7 (Fig.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	49	 (Most studies support an eight-TM topology for the presenilins (34-36), although six- and seven-TM topologies have also been suggested (37, 38)).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These heterodimers are only produced to limited levels even upon overexpression of the holoprotein (39, 41-43) and may be found at the cell surface (44).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Expression of exogenous presenilins leads to replacement of endogenous presenilin heterodimers with the corresponding exogenous heterodimers, indicating competition for limiting cellular factors needed for stabilization and endoproteolysis (45).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	52	FAD-causing presenilin mutants are likewise processed to stable heterodimers with one exception, a missense mutation in PS1 that leads to the aberrant splicing out of exon 9, a region that encodes the endoproteolytic cleavage site (39, 41).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	53	 This PS1 E9 variant is an active presenilin, like other FAD-causing presenilin mutants, causes increased A42 production (19, 46).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Upon overexpression, most PS1 E9 is rapidly degraded similar to unprocessed wild-type presenilins; however, a small portion of this PS1 variant is stabilized in cells (41, 47) and forms a high molecular weight complex like the N- and C-terminal fragments (40, 48), suggesting that it can interact with the same limiting cellular factors as wild-type presenilins.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	55	 These observations are consistent with the idea that the bioactive form of presenilin is the heterodimer and that the hydrophobic region is an inhibitory domain.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	56	 However, several artificial PS variants have been generated which are biologically active/inactive independent of their ability to undergo endoproteolysis (49, 50).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Therefore, further evidence is required to finally demonstrate the role of PS endoproteolysis for their biological and pathological function.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	58	Given the characterization of -secretase as an aspartyl protease that might catalyze an unusual intramembranous proteolysis, the sequences of presenilins were inspected and found to contain two conserved aspartates predicted to lie within TM 6 and TM 7, flanking the large cytosolic loop (51).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	59	 These aspartates appear to align with each other within the membrane and with the -secretase cleavage sites in APP (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Mutation of either aspartate to alanine completely prevented PS1 endoproteolysis, and these Asp  Ala PS1 mutants acted in a dominant-negative manner with respect to -secretase processing of APP.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Similar effects on APP processing were observed even when conservative mutations to glutamate (51) or asparagine (49, 52) were made, indicating the crucial identity of these two residues as aspartates and suggesting that the effects are not likely because of misfolding.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These effects have been corroborated by several laboratories and have been seen for both PS1 and PS2 (48, 49, 51-54), although a recent study demonstrated that the TM 7 aspartate may be less tolerant of mutagenesis compared with the TM 6 aspartate (55).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	63	The aspartates are critical for -secretase independent of their role in presenilin endoproteolysis; aspartate mutation in the PS1 E9 variant still blocked -secretase activity, even though endoproteolysis is not required of this presenilin variant (51).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Together these results suggested that presenilins might be the catalytic component of -secretase; upon interaction with as yet unidentified limiting cellular factors, presenilin undergoes autoproteolysis via the two aspartates, and the two presenilin subunits remain together, each contributing one aspartate to the active site of -secretase.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The issue of autoproteolysis, however, needs further investigation, because heterologous expression of a worm PS homologue in human cells leads to a functional PS variant that is not cleaved (56), indicating that a separate "presenilinase" may at least be required to cleave worm PS.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	68	The presenilins are also critical for processing of the Notch receptor, a signaling molecule crucial for cell-fate determination during embryogenesis (57).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	69	 After translation in the ER, Notch is processed by a Furin-like protease, resulting in a heterodimeric receptor that is shuttled to the cell surface (Fig.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Upon interaction with a cognate ligand, the ectodomain of Notch is shed by a metalloprotease apparently identical to tumor necrosis factor- converting enzyme (TACE) (58, 59).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Interestingly, metalloproteases such as TACE and ADAM-10 are among the identified -secretases that shed the APP ectodomain (8, 9).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The membrane-associated C terminus is then cut within the postulated transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which then translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with and activates the CSL (CBF1, SU(H), Lag-1) family of transcription factors (60).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	73	 NICD formation is absolutely required for signaling from the Notch receptor; knock-in of a single point mutation near the transmembrane cleavage site in Notch1 results in an embryonic lethal phenotype in mice virtually identical to that observed upon knockout of the entire Notch1 protein (61).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	74	The parallels between APP and Notch processing are striking.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Not only are both cleaved by TACE, but also the transmembrane regions of both proteins are processed by a -secretase-like protease that requires presenilins.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Deletion of PS1 in mice is embryonic lethal, with a phenotype similar to that observed upon knockout of Notch1 (62, 63), and the PS1/PS2 double knockout phenotype is even more similar (64, 65).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Deficiency in PS1 dramatically reduces NICD formation (66), and the complete absence of presenilins results in total abolition of NICD production (25, 26).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Treatment of cells with -secretase inhibitors designed from the transmembrane cleavage site within APP likewise blocks NICD production (66) and nuclear translocation (67) and reduces Notch signaling from a reporter gene (67).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Moreover, the two conserved TM aspartates in presenilins are required for cleavage of the Notch TM domain; as seen with -secretase inhibitors, expression of Asp mutant PS1 or PS2 results in reduction of NICD formation, translocation, and signaling (44, 54, 55, 67).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Thus, if presenilins are the catalytic components of the -secretases that process APP, they are also likely the catalytic components of the related proteases that clip the transmembrane region of Notch.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	81	Subcellular localization presents a potential problem for the idea that presenilins could be -secretases; presenilins are primarily found in the ER and early Golgi (68), whereas -secretase activity apparently takes place on the cell surface and in the ER and Golgi (69-74).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Small amounts of presenilin heterodimers, however, have been found at the cell surface in complexation with the membrane-associated C terminus of Notch (44), and only small amounts of this presumably bioactive form should be needed for catalysis.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Nevertheless, this "spatial paradox" still needs clear resolution.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Another perplexing phenomenon is that the holoproteins of APP and Notch form stable complexes with presenilins in the ER (75-77).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	85	 APP and Notch themselves are not substrates for -secretase, so why do they interact with presenilin if presenilin is the protease? However, as mentioned above, the membrane-associated C terminus of Notch likewise forms stable complexes (44), and APP-derived C83 and C99 can also complex with presenilins in the presence of a -secretase inhibitor or when either critical presenilin aspartate is mutated (78).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Perhaps presenilins mature together with APP or Notch.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Other unresolved issues are the site and specificity of Notch cleavage vis a vis that of APP.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Although Notch appears to be cleaved within its transmembrane region, the site of cleavage is close to the cytosolic edge, whereas the APP -secretase site is apparently in the middle of the membrane.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	89	 For either cleavage event, though, only one of the proteolytic products has been identified; characterizing the other fragments may clarify this issue.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	90	 As for sequence specificity, a single Val to Leu change prevents proteolysis of the Notch transmembrane region (60), whereas a variety of mutations in the APP transmembrane region is tolerated by -secretase.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Examination of these proteolytic events in purified enzyme assays may offer insights to resolve this problem, especially since recent data suggest that not only APP but also Notch endoproteolysis occurs largely independent of sequence (79).

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	94	Advancing the understanding of -secretase and the role of presenilins in this activity had been hampered by the lack of an isolated enzyme assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	95	 (80) reported a solubilized -secretase assay that faithfully reproduces the properties of the protease activity observed in whole cells.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Isolated microsomes were solubilized with detergent, and -secretase activity was determined by measuring A production from a Flag-tagged version of C99.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A40 and A42 were produced in the same ratio as seen in living cells (~9:1), and peptidomimetics that blocked A40 and A42 formation in cells likewise inhibited production of these A species in the solubilized protease assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	98	 After separation of the detergent-solubilized material by size-exclusion chromatography, -secretase activity coeluted with the two subunits of PS1.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Remarkably, immunoprecipitated PS1 heterodimers also produced A from the Flag-tagged substrate, strongly suggesting that presenilins are part of a large -secretase complex.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	100	More direct evidence that presenilins are the catalytic components of -secretases has recently come from affinity labeling studies using transition-state analogue inhibitors targeted to the active site of the protease.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	101	 (80, 81) identified a peptidomimetic that blocks -secretase activity with an IC50 of 0.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	103	 While the transition-state mimicking alcohol directs the compound to aspartyl proteases, flanking substructures determine specificity.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Photoactivatable versions of this compound bound covalently to presenilin subunits exclusively (82).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Interestingly, installation of the photoreactive group on one end of the inhibitor led to labeling of the N-terminal presenilin subunit, whereas installation on the other end resulted in the tagging of the C-terminal subunit.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Moreover, whereas these agents did not label wild-type PS1 holoprotein, they did tag PS1 E9, which (as described above) is not processed to heterodimers but nevertheless is active.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	107	 (83) identified peptidomimetic inhibitors containing a difluoro alcohol group, another type of transition-state mimicking moiety, and these compounds were developed starting from a substrate-based inhibitor designed from the -secretase cleavage site in APP.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Conversion of one such analogue to a reactive bromoacetamide provided an affinity reagent that likewise bound covalently and specifically to PS1 subunits in cell lysates, isolated microsomes, and whole cells.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Either PS1 subunit so labeled could be brought down with antibodies to the other subunit under coimmunoprecipitation conditions, demonstrating that the inhibitor bound to heterodimeric PS1.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Seiffert and colleagues (84) likewise identified presenilin subunits as the molecular target of novel peptidomimetic -secretase inhibitors.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	111	 These inhibitors, however, do not resemble known transition-state mimics, so it is not clear whether they would be expected to bind to the active site of the protease.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	112	Taken together, these results strongly suggest that heterodimeric presenilins contain the catalytic component of -secretase; inhibitors in two of the three studies are transition-state analogues targeted to the active site.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The active site is likely at the PS heterodimeric interface; both subunits are labeled by -secretase affinity reagents, and each contributes one critical aspartate.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The affinity labeling studies also identify the protease responsible for the transmembrane cleavage of Notch, because substrate-based -secretase inhibitors like those used by Esler et al.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	115	 (83) also block this Notch proteolysis (see above).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	116	 These findings reinforce the amyloid hypothesis of AD pathogenesis; all FAD-causing mutations identified to date (accounting for ~60% of all FAD cases) are either in the precursor protein leading to A (APP) or appear to be located in the proteases that catalyze the final step in A generation (presenilins/-secretases).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	117	 At the same time, an important target for drug development has been identified, although it is not yet clear whether toxic effects of blocking cleavage of other -secretase substrates (e.

0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	122	The discovery that presenilins are likely -secretases raises a number of fascinating questions with respect to protease biochemistry as well as protease evolution.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	123	 To carry out hydrolysis in a lipid environment, the transmembrane regions likely form a pore- or channel-like topography, with polar residues facing inward to allow entry of and interaction with the catalytic water.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	124	 With such a sequestered active site and the two-dimensional fluidity of the lipid bilayer, the substrate probably first interacts with a binding site on the outer surface of the protease, with subsequent conformational changes allowing entry of the substrate to the active site within the protease interior.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Further, given that the conformation of the substrate upon initial interaction with the protease is apparently an -helix, the enzyme must have some mechanism for unwinding or bending the substrate near the site of cleavage so that the catalytic water and protease residues can access the scissile amide bond.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	126	As for the origin of presenilins and other intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) (85), it seems likely that certain polytopic integral membrane proteins acquired a few catalytic residues essential for catalysis rather than that soluble proteases somehow acquired multiple transmembrane domains.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	127	 This would explain why polytopic membrane proteases bear little or no sequence homology with soluble proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	128	 For instance, in the S2P family of proteases that process membrane-bound transcription factors in mammals and bacteria, each contains an essential HEXXH motif that is a consensus sequence for a number of metalloproteases (86).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Otherwise, they bear little resemblance to other metalloproteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Similarly, presenilins require two conserved aspartates for proteolytic function but otherwise do not look like typical aspartyl proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Apparently there are only a very limited number of efficient biochemical solutions to the problem of proteolysis, as mechanisms conferred to polytopic proteases are strikingly similar to those of soluble and membrane-tethered proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	132	 Interestingly, the presenilins contain a motif near one of the critical aspartates that is also found in the bacterial type 4 prepilin protease family (50, 87), polytopic aspartyl proteases that also have eight transmembrane domains and require two completely conserved aspartates (88).
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	133	 This finding further supports the idea that presenilins may indeed be polytopic aspartyl proteases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	134	Considerable work lies ahead to understand presenilins/-secretases.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Clearly, the top priority is to identify the other critical components of the -secretase complex, allowing reconstitution of activity and development of a purified enzyme assay.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Assembly of the complex into active -secretase should allow more focused structural-functional studies than the current approach of expressing mutant proteins in whole cells or organisms.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Also, understanding how the more than 70 different FAD mutations in presenilins cause specific increases in A42 production might shed some light on how this deleterious function can be skewed in favor of other less noxious A isoforms.
0.44692016.11134059.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Such understanding should not only suggest novel therapeutic approaches to AD but should also undergird our appreciation of the workings of an emerging class of polytopic membrane proteases.

0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we screened for proteins interacting with presenilin 2 (PS2) and cloned DRAL.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	6	 DRAL is an LIM-only protein containing four LIM domains and an N-terminal half LIM domain.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Previously DRAL has been cloned as a co-activator of the androgen receptor and as a protein interacting with a DNA replication regulatory protein, hCDC47.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Our yeast two-hybrid assay showed that DRAL interacted with a hydrophilic loop region (amino acids 269 to 298) in the endoproteolytic N-terminal fragment of PS2, but not that of PS1, although the region 269 to 298 of PS2 and the corresponding PS1 sequence differ by only three amino acids.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Each point mutation within this region, R275A, T280A, Q282A, R284A, N285A, P287T, I288L, F289A and S296A, in PS2 abolished the binding.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This suggests that DRAL recognizes the PS2 structure specifically.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The in vitro interaction was confirmed by affinity column assay and the physiological interactions between endogenous PS2 and DRAL by co-immunoprecipitation from human lung fibroblast MRC5 cells.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Furthermore, in PS2-overexpressing HEK293 cells, we found an increase in the amount of DRAL in the membrane fraction and an increase in the amount of DRAL that was co-immunoprecipitated with PS2.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The potential role of DRAL in the cellular signaling suggests that DRAL functions as an adaptor protein that links PS2 to an intracellular signaling.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease (AD) is characterized clinically by progressive dementia and neuropathologically by neuronal loss, formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Senile plaques have deposits primarily composed of a 40 to 42 amino acid peptide called ss-amyloid peptide (Ass), which is derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Three genes [APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2)] have been identified as harboring pathogenic mutations that affect APP processing (1).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	17	 We confirmed the mutation of the PS1 gene in Japanese patients and showed that mutation also occurs in a sporadic manner (2).

0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	173	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In this study we showed that DRAL interacted with a large hydrophilic loop region (amino acids 269 to 298) in the endoproteolytic N-terminal fragment of PS2, but not that of PS1, by yeast two-hybrid and GST-binding assays.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In an immunoprecipitation study using MRC5 cell extracts, we also demonstrated that endogenous DRAL interacted with PS2.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Furthermore, in PS2-overexpressing HEK293 cells we found an increase in the amount of DRAL in the membrane fraction and an increase in the amount of DRAL that was co-immunoprecipitated with PS2.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Thus, it is clear that DRAL interacts with PS2 physiologically.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Each of nine single amino acid substitutions within the region 269 to 298 abolished the binding with DRAL.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	178	 These results suggest that DRAL recognizes the PS2 structure specifically.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	179	 It is interesting that DRAL interacts with the loop region of PS2 but not that of PS1, although amino acids 269 to 298 of PS2 and the corresponding PS1 sequence differ by only three amino acids.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	180	 On the other hand, we showed previously that -catenin interacted with a large hydrophilic loop region in the endoproteolytic C-terminal fragment of PS1, but not of PS2 (31).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	181	 In addition, PSAP containing a PDZ-like domain interacts with the C-terminus of PS1 but not of PS2 (32), sorcin interacts with PS2 but not PS1 (22) and calmyrin preferentially interacts with amino acids 270 to 319 of PS2 in yeast two-hybrid assays (18).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Furthermore, whereas PS1-null mice show developmental defects that culminate in a perinatal lethality, PS2-null mice exhibit no obvious defects (33).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These results suggest that PS1 and PS2 partly differ in function.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	184	 (18), the double mutants of the PS1 loop C region (amino acids 264 to 294 of PS1), PS1(L282I, T291A), PS1(T281P, L282I) and PS1(T281P, T291A), are equivalent to our single mutants of PS2, P287T, A297T and I288L, respectively.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Although the DRAL binding activities were abolished by single mutations of P287T and I288L in PS2, calmyrin binding activities were retained at 32 and 219% of wild-type PS2 (18).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This suggests that DRAL and calmyrin recognize different structures in PS2.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	187	 The LIM domains have been reported to bind various motifs and sequences that are structurally quite different.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	188	 LIM domains can associate with other LIM domains to form homo- or heterodimers (34,35).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In addition, LIM domains also bind tyrosine-containing tight-turn structures, PDZ domains, ankyrin repeats, the SH3 domain and helix to loop to helix domains in proteins lacking LIM domains including tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase, cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors (36 to 42).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The interaction between the LIM domains of DRAL and PS2 does not belong to these categories.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The DRAL binding domain within amino acids 269 to 298 of PS2 has two predicted polyproline type II helix structures, 284RNEPIFP290 and 270PKGPLR275, which have consensus sequences for SH3 binding sites (class 1, RXXPXXP; and class 2, PXXPXR; where P and R are crucial for the binding) (43).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Although the single amino acid substitution in the 284RNEPIFP290 sequence abolished or reduced the binding activity, the P290A substitution did not abolish the binding.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Moreover, other residues affected the binding, so the binding site cannot be simply adapted to the SH3 binding motif.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	194	 However, PS2 may interact with proteins containing the SH3 domain.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Since DRAL may shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus and has multiple protein to protein interactive domains, there is a possibility that it interacts with other protein partners and participates in an intracellular signal transduction pathway.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	196	 (44) reported that DRAL interacted with the DNA replication regulatory protein, hCDC47 (44).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	197	 hCDC47 is a human member of the minichromosome maintenance family that has been implicated in the regulatory machinery causing DNA to replicate once in the S phase.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	198	 On the other hand, DRAL has been cloned as a co-activator of the androgen receptor: the transcription of the probasin gene, one of the targets for the prostate-specific androgen receptor, is co-activated by DRAL (27).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	199	 These findings suggest that DRAL acts as a modulator for DNA replication and gene transcription.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Furthermore, a typical androgen, testosterone, increases the secretion of the non-amyloidgenic APP fragment, sAPP, and decreases the secretion of Ass peptides from N2a and rat primary cerebrocortical neurons (45).
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	201	 So it is possible that DRAL affects APP metabolism.
0.45724565.11001931.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Although further studies are required to elucidate the relevance to the PS2 to DRAL interaction and the role in AD, it appears that DRAL may function as an adaptor protein that links PS2 to an intracellular signalling.

0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We initially cloned the mutant PS1 loop into the pAS2-1 expression vector, but a toxic overexpression of the loop led us to subclone it into the pGBT9 vector which contains an ADH1 truncated promoter with a lower level of expression.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The pGBT9 (PS1LH392) construct, which did not lead by itself to the activation of the two reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ, was used to screen ~600 000 transformants, and 23 clones were found to co-activate both reporter genes.

0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	80	Our results indicate that Rab11 interacts with presenilins as: (i) two distinct cDNAs corresponding to the C-terminal half of Rab11 were identified in a two-hybrid screen using mutant Leu392Val PS1 hydrophilic loop as a bait; (ii) Rab11 was shown to interact not only with the hydrophilic loop of PS1, but also with that of PS2, the second member of the PS family; and (iii) the interaction was confirmed in cells transfected with plasmids expressing the full-length PSs and Rab11 as well as Rab11106-216.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The hypothesis of a gain of function led us to perform the screening with a mutant form of PS1.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	82	 In yeast, we were unable to detect any difference in the binding to Rab11 between the wild-type and mutant form of PS1, which does not exclude a subtle difference in the affinity of both proteins.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In transfected COS cells, the PS1-Rab11 interaction was more difficult to detect than the PS2-Rab11 interaction (Fig.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	84	 2), which might be explained by a difference in the quality of PS1 and PS2 antibodies.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The alternative hypothesis is that the interaction between Rab11 and PS1 is either transient or of low affinity.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	86	 It should be noted that the Rab11-binding domain of PS1 (amino acids 374-400) corresponds to a region of the loop highly conserved between PS1 and PS2 (89% identity), which supports the functional importance of this domain.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	87	Rab11, which is composed of 216 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of ~25 kDa, belongs to the Rab subgroup of the Ras-related superfamily of small GTPases, which comprises >30 members.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Rab proteins have emerged as important regulatory components of the vesicular transport and organelle dynamics in eucaryotic cells, each step of cellular trafficking involving a different set of Rab proteins (44,45).
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Rab proteins contain four consensus regions (G1-4) known to be involved in GTP/GDP binding and, as is the case for other members of the Ras superfamily, Rab proteins undergo a functional cycle between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active conformation.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Interestingly, the domain of Rab11 involved in PS1 binding involves the G4 region (46), which might suggest that such an interaction might interfere with the GTP/GDP binding status of Rab11.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Rab11 is ubiquitously expressed and, at the subcellular level, has been localized in different cell types within different compartments including the TGN and TGN-derived vesicles (47), the pericentriolar recycling endosome (48) and apical tubulovesicle membranes (49).
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	92	 At the present time, the function of Rab11 has not been elucitated fully.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The association of Rab11 with transferrin-containing recycling compartments (50) suggests a role in the trafficking and recycling of internalized proteins.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Rab11 has also been implicated in protein transport from the TGN through post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane (51,52).
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Therefore, considering that PSs have also been localized in the Golgi apparatus and perinuclear vesicles, the interaction that we report between PSs and Rab11 might be relevant in vivo.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Furthermore, recent studies have implicated several Rab proteins in trafficking and recycling of APP in specific cell compartments.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	97	 It has been proposed that Rab1b protein might regulate early steps in exocytic transport and processing of APP (53).
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	98	 APP has been localized in Rab5-covered vesicles and, in sporadic AD cases, an increased neuronal endocytosis and protease delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes, which might be a mechanism of increased [beta] amyloidogenesis, has been reported (54,55).
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	99	PS mutations linked to familial AD lead to an increased production of A[beta]1-42/43 peptide.
0.38270563.10369872.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Although the biological relevance of the PS-Rab11 interaction that we describe in this study remains to be confirmed, our results led us to speculate that this altered processing of APP might be tightly linked to an abnormal vesicular routing since amyloidergic and non-amyloidergic cleavages occur in different cells compartments.

0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	2	Background Patients with Alzheimer's disease show a wide variation in clinical phenotype.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Genetic research has been largely concerned with the role of mutations or common variants as risk factors for the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Do genetic factors also influence clinical phenotype?.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To examine the evidence that genetic factors influence the clinical expression of the disease in addition to influencing risk.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method A selective review was made of the key literature.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Mutations in three genes, coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, and a common variation (4) in another gene, APOE, have been shown to lead to an earlier development of the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	8	 More recently, genetic association and twin studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the development of other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably the appearance of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions In Alzheimer's disease genetic variation influences a number of aspects of clinical phenotype.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early family and twin studies have indicated that a number of genes have an important part to play in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Variation in these genes, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms, appears to confer increased risk for the development of the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apparent increased risk may be largely explained by the effects that genetic variation has on the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the age at which the disease presents.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it has been proposed that genetic variation may also explain some of the other features of clinical phenotype, including the development of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	14	The clearest evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is the existence of families in whom the disease is transmitted in a clear autosomal dominant pattern.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	19	While these findings are of immense importance in terms of elucidating the biological pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diease, it is important to recognise that these three causal genes may only account for 30-50% of all autosomal dominant early-onset cases, or around 10% of familial early-onset cases (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	21	The inheritance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is more complex than that of the early-onset form.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	29	More recently, the results of a number of linkage studies have become available.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	41	Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	46	GENETIC INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	47	Age of onset Families carrying mutations in the APP gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-65 years.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To date, no APP mutation carrier has been reported to be unaffected beyond the age of 67 years.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently been recorded with onset at 24 years (Wisniewski et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations are largely associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may be non-penetrant (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Penetrance is high but may not be 100%, with at least two reported cases of non-penetrance over the age of 80 years (Bird et al, 1996).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	53	The familial influence on age of onset in late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be substantial.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	62	Non-cognitive features If genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are associated with non-cognitive symptoms, then one might anticipate that subjects with a family history of the disease have an increased frequency of these symptoms.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Likewise, one would expect an association between known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including the genes for APP, PS-1, PS-2 and the ApoE 4 allele, and these symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	64	In fact, there appears to be little consistent evidence of an association between either a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease or variation in known candidate genes and an increase in the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms occurring for the first time within the disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990).
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	70	A more direct approach has also been adopted whereby common genetic polymorphisms previously showing associations with other neuropsychiatric conditions have been found to be associated with non-cognitive symptoms in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	75	Cognitive decline No study to date has looked at rates of decline in carriers of APP, PS-1 and PS-2 mutations, but patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease who have a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease show no evidence of increased rates of decline.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	80	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	81	8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	82	8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	83	0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	87	Clinical Implications and Limitations.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	88	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A number of genes have been implicated as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Variation in some of these genes appears to have a major effect in determining when   not if   the disease will develop.
0.37662143.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably non-cognitive symptoms, are also influenced by genetic variation.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	4	The mechanisms by which mutations in presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) result in the Alzheimer's disease phenotype are unclear.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Full-length PS1 and PS2 are each processed into stable proteolytic fragments after their biosynthesis in transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	6	 PS1 and PS2 have been localized by immunocytochemistry to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, but previous studies could not differentiate between the full-length presenilin proteins and their fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We carried out subcellular fractionation of cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilins and their fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Full-length PS1 and PS2 were principally distributed in ER fractions, whereas the N- and C-terminal fragments were localized predominantly to the Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In cells expressing the PS1 mutant lacking exon 9 (E9), we observed only full-length molecules that were present in the ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The turnover rate was considerably slower for the E9 holoprotein, apparently due to decreased degradation within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our results suggest that that full-length presenilin proteins are primarily ER resident molecules and undergo endoproteolysis within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The fragments are subsequently transported to the Golgi compartment, where their turnover rate is much slower than that of the full-length presenilin in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	13	    INTRODUCTION Top Abstract Introduction Materials  and  Methods Results Discussion References.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	14	Alzheimer's disease (AD),1 the major age-related dementing disorder, usually occurs sporadically in the elderly population.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In a subset of cases, familial AD (FAD) occurs as an inherited autosomal dominant disease.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Mutations in three different genes are associated with the familial form of AD (reviewed in Ref.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The first FAD gene is the -amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor to amyloid -protein, the major component of senile plaques seen in brains of AD individuals.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The other genes, presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 (2) and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosome 1 (3, 4), account for the majority of the early onset cases of FAD.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	19	PS1 and PS2, which are functionally homologous to the C.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	20	 elegans Sel-12 molecule (5, 6), are hydrophobic proteins that cross the membrane 6-8 times (7, 8).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In transfected cells, both PS1 and PS2 holoprotein are rapidly turned over with a half-life of under 1 h (9, 10).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, in transfected cells and in brain tissue, stable N- (NTF) and C-terminal fragments (CTF) are apparently generated by endoproteolysis from full-length presenilin molecules (9, 11, 12).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Immunolocalization studies of presenilins in transfected cells have demonstrated a predominant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi distribution (13, 14).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The localization pattern is similar regardless of whether the antibodies are generated to either N- or C-terminal epitopes, raising the possibility that the NTFs and CTFs remain in proximity to each other.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, these studies cannot distinguish the full-length presenilin molecules from the stable fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	26	 APP is also located in the ER and Golgi, where direct or indirect interaction with the presenilins may contribute to the production of longer forms of amyloid -peptide (A) (15-17).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Thus, knowledge of the processing and trafficking of presenilin molecules is important to our understanding of the pathways of A production.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	28	The role of endoproteolysis in presenilin maturation and function remains to be defined.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Interestingly, a PS1 FAD mutation lacking exon 9 (E9) that results in the absence of conventional endoproteolysis (12) can nevertheless functionally replace an egg-laying defect resulting from a C.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	30	 To date, neither the subcellular distribution of the holoprotein and its fragments nor the compartment where endoproteolytic cleavage occurs is known.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	31	 To define the distribution of full-length forms and stable fragments of PS1 and PS2, we carried out subcellular fractionation of stably transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Our results indicate that full-length PS1 and PS2 are located mainly in the ER, while their N- and C-terminal fragments are located principally in the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Turnover rate of the E9 mutant PS1 protein was slower than wild type (WT) PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Concomitantly, the steady state subcellular distribution of E9 PS1 extends to both ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Finally, pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation suggested that the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 takes place in the ER.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	61	The viscosity of the gradient medium is a major determinant of the sedimentation rate.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In addition, because subcellular organelles are osmotically sensitive, the osmotic activity of the gradient medium is particularly important.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Thus, although sucrose, glycerol, and Ficoll are widely used for gradient fractionation of cellular membranes, they are not ideal in osmolality and viscosity.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	66	 The advantage of using Iodixanol gradient is that osmolality and viscosity remain relatively constant with changes in the density of the gradient.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The subcellular markers, calnexin, galactosyltransferase, and Na+/K+-ATPase, were analyzed in each gradient preparation.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	74	Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting-- Subcellular fractions collected from linear Iodixanol gradients were lysed by addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Samples from pulse-chase experiments were transferred to membranes following fractionation and quantitated directly by phosphor imaging.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Western blotting was carried out with antibodies as indicated for each experiment.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, E9 mutant protein, which does not undergo the conventional endoproteolytic cleavage (12), was widely distributed throughout the gradient fractions (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The extension of E9 PS1 into the lighter Golgi fractions was not a result of overexpression, because the same result was seen when muristerone A was reduced in this cell line to match the level of expression seen in WT PS1-transfected 293 cells (Fig.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	144	E9 Mutant PS1 Has a Longer Half-life-- It has been reported that transfected full-length presenilin, mainly located in ER as shown above, has a short half-life, while N- and C-terminal fragments, mainly located in Golgi as shown above, have a substantially longer half-life (9, 22).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Futhermore, our results showed that E9 protein, extending from ER to Golgi-rich and lighter fractions, had a distinctly different subcellular distribution as compared with WT PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	146	 To determine whether the E9 mutant has a different turnover rate, WT and E9 PS1 stably transfected 293 cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min and chased for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The half-life of WT PS1 was under 1 h (average of approximately 50 min from multiple experiments) for the holoprotein and more than 8 h for the NTF (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	148	 On the other hand, the half-life of E9 was consistently twice as long as WT PS1 holoprotein (Fig.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	149	 At steady state conditions as documented in the experiments described above, E9 protein was also present in the Golgi fractions, where stable proteolytic fragments derived from endogenous PS1 were located.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Surprisingly, the distribution of the E9 mutant PS1 was not substantially altered during the chase period (Fig.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The gradient fractions showed that the longer half-life of E9 was due primarily to diminished turnover of protein in the ER fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The distribution of NTF (arrowhead) in PS1 WT cells was shifted from the dense to lighter fractions during the chase period (top).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	165	 NTF derived from endogenous PS1 in E9 cells did not appear until the 4 h time point (bottom).

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	169	 After 1 h of chase, the levels of labeled NTF were increased and were distributed more widely, extending into the lighter fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Finally, after 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was predominantly within the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at the steady state conditions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	171	 These findings indicated that the initial cleavage of PS1 occurred in the ER and the proteolytic fragments were subsequently transported to the Golgi.

0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	175	The mechanisms by which mutations in PS1 and PS2 result in the early onset of the AD phenotype are unclear.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	176	 It is hypothesized that the selective increase in the production and release of the amyloidogenic A42 as a result of the presenilin mutations is a key factor in the pathogenesis of FAD (10, 23-26).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	177	 At present, the intracellular compartment where presenilin interacts directly or indirectly with APP is unknown.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In this study, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of presenilins in transfected cells.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Our results showed that PS1 and PS2 are similarly distributed, with holoproteins being principally located in the ER, while the stable PS1 and PS2 fragments were principally located in the Golgi.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The E9 PS1 mutation results in a broader distribution of the protein in both ER and Golgi-rich fractions as well as a prolonged turnover rate due to diminished degradation within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Our results also indicate that endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments occurs in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	182	Previous immunolocalization studies of transfected cells demonstrated that both PS1 and PS2 are located in the ER and Golgi (13, 14).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	183	 These studies, however, could not distinguish the signals derived from full-length protein versus stable NTFs and CTFs.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We therefore carried out subcellular fractionations of CHO and 293 cells stably transfected with PS1 or PS2 to determine the localization of full-length presenilin and its fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our results showed that full-length PS1 and PS2 were distributed in dense fractions that colocalized with the ER marker, calnexin.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Both stable NTF and CTF were distributed predominantly in the lighter fractions that colocalized with the Golgi marker, -galactosyltransferase activity.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	187	 In these gradient fractions, the ER and Golgi fractions overlapped with each other and did not represent distinct populations.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	188	 We also cannot exclude the possibility of other organelles containing presenilins that may co-purify into same gradient fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Therefore, our studies can only determine the predominant localization of these presenilin protein species to these compartments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Lesser amounts of protein in other locations cannot be excluded, nor did we examine the nuclear localization of the presenilins as was reported recently (27).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Nonetheless, the clear subcellular separation between the full-length presenilins and the stable fragments is noteworthy, because it is not known whether the normal physiological function of presenilin is provided by full-length molecules or proteolytic fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	192	In our study, the subcellular distributions for two PS1 mutations (M146L and C410Y) and the N141I PS2 mutation were similar to each other and to the respective WT presenilins.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Therefore, most mutations do not overtly alter presenilin trafficking.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In contrast, the noncleavable E9 PS1 mutant was localized to a larger number of gradient fractions, being distributed to both ER and Golgi fractions.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In addition, as was shown recently (22), pulse-chase studies showed that the turnover rate of E9 mutant protein was considerably slower than WT PS1 holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	196	 We initially speculated that the transport of E9 to the Golgi compartment where the stable presenilin fragments are located may underlie the decrease in turnover rate of this mutant protein species.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	197	 However, pulse-chase labeling combined with subcellular fractionation showed that a significant pool of pulse-labeled E9 protein remained intact within the ER at a time when WT PS1 holoprotein was completely degraded.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This result suggests that reduced proteolytic degradation of E9 within the ER is responsible for the increased half-life of this molecule.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In time, a small fraction of undegraded protein, together with the endogenous NTF and CTF, are found in the Golgi compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	200	Previous studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between E9 expression and endogenous NTF levels (22, 26), suggesting that mutant holoprotein competes with the normal cleavage of endogenous PS1.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In this study, increasing expression of E9 mutant protein by muristerone A induction similarly led to progressively lower levels of endogenous PS1 stable fragments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Interestingly, in the pulse-chase/fractionation studies, the appearance of labeled endogenous fragments was delayed.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Therefore, production of NTF from proteolysis of endogenous PS1 is affected both quantitatively and kinetically in the presence of E9 mutant protein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This competition is likely to occur in the ER, because E9 appeared to be largely degraded in this compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	205	Our study also provides evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 to generate stable NTF and CTF occurs in the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Pulse-chase experiments combined with subcellular fractionation showed that the initial pool of labeled NTF, albeit in very low levels, was located predominantly in the ER fractions, similar to labeled holoprotein.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	207	 During the chase period, however, the amount of labeled NTF increased, consistent with a precursor-product relationship between full-length protein species and their fragments within the ER.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Importantly, the NTF was seen to distribute to lighter fractions during the chase.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	209	 By 4 h of chase, labeled NTF was distributed predominantly to the Golgi-enriched fractions, similar to that seen at steady state.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Taken together, these observations provide compelling evidence that constitutive endoproteolysis of PS1 occurs initially in the ER compartment.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	211	With the notable exception of the E9 mutation, the subcellular distribution of all of the other PS1 (M146L, C410Y) and PS2 (N141I) mutations was indistinguishable from WT PS1 and PS2, respectively.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Since all of these presenilin mutations have been reported to show a selective increase in A42 production (10, 17), our results suggest that perturbations in the ER to Golgi processing at this level cannot explain how mutants alter A42 generation.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Like the presenilins, maturation of APP in the exocytic pathway occurs in the ER and Golgi compartments.
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Thus, colocalization of both APP and presenilins in the same subcellular compartments leads to the possibility of an interaction between these two molecules, as has been reported in transfected cells (15, 17).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Using subcellular fractionation, we have recently detected increased levels of A42 in ER and Golgi fractions of cells expressing mutant presenilins (16).
0.3514349.9575200.html.plaintext.txt	216	 These observations suggest that understanding the molecular interactions between APP and presenilins as well as other proteins within these cellular compartments will be important in resolving the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 are polytopic membrane proteins, whose genes are mutated in some individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Presenilins have been shown to influence limited proteolysis of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP), Notch and ErbB4, and have been proposed to be -secretases that perform the terminal cleavage of APP.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In this model, two conserved and apparently intramembranous aspartic acids participate in catalysis.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Highly sequence-similar presenilin homologues are known in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In this work, we have used a combination of different sequence database search methods to identify a new family of proteins homologous to presenilins.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Members of this family, which we term presenilin homologues (PSH), have significant sequence similarities to presenilins and also possess two conserved aspartic acid residues within adjacent predicted transmembrane segments.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The PSH family is found throughout the eukaryotes, in fungi as well as plants and animals, and in archaea.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Five PSHs are detectable in the human genome, of which three possess  protease-associated  domains that are consistent with the proposed protease function of PSs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Based on these findings, we propose that PSs and PSHs represent different sub-branches of a larger family of polytopic membrane-associated aspartyl proteases.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) are members of an evolutionarily conserved family of polytopic membrane proteins that are thought to span the membrane six to eight times (reviewed in 1).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Presenilins were initially identified through genetic linkage analysis of families with autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	14	 To date, numerous mutations in the chromosome 14-encoded PS1 gene and several in the chromosome 1-encoded PS2 gene have been linked to rare forms of familial AD (see http://www.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	15	org/members/resources/pres_mutations/index.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	16	Studies of PSs and their role in the development of AD have led to an appreciation that they regulate a number of diverse functions in the cell.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	17	 PSs have been shown to play a role in proteolytic processing of amyloid ss protein precursor (APP) and APP family members (2,3), Notch and Notch family members (4,5), and ErbB4 (6).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In all cases, PSs appear to be required to permit the release of the cytoplasmic tail of these proteins from a membrane-bound stub that is generated after ectodomain cleavage of the holoprotein.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Significantly, inhibition of the release of the membrane-bound stub of these proteins alters signaling cascades that appear to be mediated by translocation of the cytoplasmic tail to the nucleus (6 to 8).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	20	 PSs have also been shown to interact with a wide array of different proteins, and have been implicated in IP3-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (9), capacitative calcium entry (10,11), ss-catenin signaling (12 to 14) and protein trafficking (15).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	21	Much work on PSs has focused on their role in processing APP (1).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	22	 PSs have been shown to influence the final cleavage step in the release of the approximately 4 kDa amyloid ss protein (Ass) from APP, a proteolysis that is referred to as -secretase cleavage.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This event generates Ass from a membrane stub of the APP, which in turn is produced by a previous hydrolysis of the APP holoprotein by a membrane-bound aspartyl protease referred to as ss-secretase.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Significantly, -secretase generates Ass peptides of varying lengths, with the two species of most interest being peptides of 40 amino acids (Ass40) and 42 amino acids (Ass42).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In all cases studied to date, mutant PSs increase the relative level of Ass42 production.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	26	 As the longer Ass42 aggregates more rapidly than other forms of Ass and had previously been shown to be increased by AD-linked mutations in the APP, these studies not only implicated PSs as modulators of -secretase cleavage, but also convinced many in the AD field that this longer form of Ass was critical to AD pathogenesis (16).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	27	Subsequent to these initial studies on AD-linked PS mutations, three lines of evidence have emerged to support a direct role of PS in -secretase cleavage of APP, as well as the -secretase cleavage that regulates the release of the cytoplasmic tails of Notch and ErbB4.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	28	 First, at the genetic level, PSs appear to be essential for -cleavage.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	29	 PS1 knockout markedly inhibits -secretase cleavage (3,4), whereas PS2 knockout has no apparent effect on -secretase activity (17), probably owing to compensation by the more widely expressed PS1.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, a combined PS1/PS2 knockout completely abolishes -secretase activity (18,19).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Second, biochemical evidence also supports the identification of PSs as -secretases.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	32	 PSs co-fractionate with -secretase activity in a high-molecular-weight complex, and this in vitro activity can be recovered in the pellet after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PS1 (20).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition, mutation of two absolutely conserved aspartate residues (D257 and D385 in PS1, and D263 and D366 in PS2) results in PSs that act in a dominant-negative fashion  to  at least with respect to -secretase activity (21,22).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This leads to the hypothesis that PSs represent a novel class of intramembranous cleaving diaspartyl proteases, a hypothesis supported by inhibitor studies (23,24).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Third, four groups have been able to show that inhibitors of -secretase activity bind with varying degrees of specificity to both PS1 and PS2 (25 to 28).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Collectively, these experiments indicate that compounds, including some with properties of protease inhibitors, can bind to PSs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Moreover, given that two groups had specifically designed their inhibitors to be transition state analogues of aspartyl proteases, it certainly appears that, despite the lack of demonstrable homology to known aspartyl proteases, PSs may be just that.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	38	More recently, the primary sequence encompassing one of the aspartate residues (D385 in PS1 and D366 in PS2) in PSs has been proposed to be similar to a region of type IV prepilin peptidases that contain a catalytic aspartate residue (29,30).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This sequence motif similarity, and their common feature of spanning the membrane several times, suggests that PSs and the bacterial signal peptidases may be distinct members of a novel class of intramembranous proteases.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Despite their local sequence similarities, PSs and type IV prepilin peptidases are not demonstrably homologous.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In order to investigate whether PSs possess hitherto unappreciated divergent homologues, we undertook searches of protein and nucleotide sequence databases using PSI-BLAST (31) and a hidden Markov model package (32).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These searches revealed a family of sequences with significant similarities to presenilins.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	43	 This observation may assist in elucidating the molecular and cellular functions of PSs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	44	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Human PS1 and PS2 sequences were compared with a non-redundant database (NR) using PSI-BLAST (31) and an E-value threshold of 2x10-3.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This search revealed that a mouse sequence of unknown function (GenInfo code 12849450) was marginally similar, albeit with non-significant statistics, to PS1 and PS2 (E=1.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	46	3, respectively; 2 search rounds).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	47	 When this mouse sequence was compared with NR, it was evident that it is but one of a large family of proteins with representatives among the fungi, plants, arthropods, nematode worms, vertebrates and archaea.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This family showed three intriguing similarities with PSs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	49	 First, they are both families of transmembrane (TM) proteins whose sequences can be aligned almost throughout their entire lengths (Fig.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Second, they both contain conserved YD, GhGD and PAL motifs (h represents a hydrophobic residue) in the same collinear arrangement (Figs 1 and 2).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Third, the YD and GhGD motifs, which in PSs include their candidate active site aspartic acid residues (21), are unusual in that they are present within predicted adjacent TM segments.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	70	  In order to investigate whether the newly identified protein family is homologous to PSs, we constructed its multiple sequence alignment and compared a global hidden Markov model (32), derived from the alignment, with a second non-redundant database, nrdb90.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Results showed that presenilins represented all of the highest-scoring sequences, including a plant presenilin (Arabidopsis thaliana gene product At2g29900) whose sequence similarity to the family was significant (E=5.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	72	 These significant sequence similarities demonstrate that the eukaryotic and archaeal proteins represent a novel family of presenilin homologues (PSHs).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	73	Five distinct PSH genes were evident from the human genome sequence.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	74	 PSH genes were found in fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in archaea such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	75	 This is the first time that PS homologues have been detected in eukaryotes other than plants and animals, and in prokaryotes.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	76	As predicted from their presence in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database, the human PSH RT to PCR experiments confirm that each of the PSHs is expressed in humans (Fig.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	77	 PCR products can be amplified both from a human brain cDNA library and from H4 cDNA.

0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	87	  The proximity of PSH2 to the MAPT gene, which codes for the microtubule-associated protein tau, on chromosome 17 suggested that it might be a candidate gene for the variant of FTDP-17 that occurs in families that lack tau pathology and obvious mutations in tau (33 to 35).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Sequence analysis was therefore performed in the probands from four families with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with similar clinical and pathological phenotypes to these tau-negative families.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, in each case, the FTD family was not large enough to confirm linkage to chromosome 17.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In addition, PSH2 was sequenced in control samples with H1/H1 and H2/H2 MAPT genotypes to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with these haplotypes in the adjacent MAPT gene.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This analysis demonstrated that PSH2 is highly polymorphic, with 12 SNPs being detected, of which nine alter the encoded amino acid sequence (Table 1).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Nine of the PSH2 SNPs were apparently in complete linkage disequilibrium with the H1/H2 haplotypes in the adjacent MAPT gene.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, none of the SNPs were obviously pathogenic in the four FTD families, since all were present in control individuals or did not segregate with disease (R123Q and E209K).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	94	 SNPs identified by sequence analysis of PSH2      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The newly identified PSHs could be aligned over their entire lengths with PSs, encompassing PS TM segments 2 to 8 (Fig.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Despite their apparent lack of TM segment 1, they appear to have the same membrane topology as PSs as a consequence of their signal peptide sequences.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Regions that are highly conserved between the two families include not only the putative active site aspartic acid residues, but also TM sequences and a  PALP  motif that is reported to be obligatory for stabilization, complex formation and -secretase activities of presenilins (36).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Several animal and plant PSHs were found to contain N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domains that often co-occur with peptidase domains (37).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	98	 This is consistent with a hypothesis that PSHs and, also by homology, PSs possess peptidase function.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	99	Of the five human PSH genes, the PSH1 gene neighbors a locus on chromosome 12q24 with linkage to bipolar risk (38).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	100	 PSH2 is the most proximal gene to the MAPT gene, encoding the tau protein, on chromosome 17q21.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Hyperphosphorylated forms of tau are often found in the brains of patients with AD, and MAPT mutations are associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (39,40).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	102	 On one hand, the close proximity of a PS homologue to a gene whose dysfunction is intimately associated with neurodegenerative conditions might be coincidental.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	103	 On the other hand, the close proximity (50 kb) of these genes might be significant, since sequence analysis has revealed multiple (nine) SNPs in PSH2 that are in complete linkage disequilibrium with the extended H1/H2 haplotypes in the MAPT gene (41).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The H1 haplotype is a genetic risk factor for the development of the sporadic tauopathies progressive supranuclear palsy (41) and cortical basal degeneration (42).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	105	 In addition, the location of PSH2 might be relevant to families that have been described with FTDP-17 lacking tau pathology and without obvious mutations in the MAPT gene (33 to 35).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Sequencing of PSH2 in multiple MAPT mutation-negative FTD families that have similar clinical and pathological phenotypes to these FTDP-17 families has thus far failed to reveal any evidence of pathogenic mutations.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, none of the sequenced tau-negative FTD families is large enough to demonstrate linkage to chromosome 17q, and thus we cannot exclude PSH2 as a candidate gene for  tau-negative  FTDP-17.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The remaining three PSH genes are on chromosomes 20q11.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	109	All of the PSHs appear to be widely expressed, since each is represented by numerous ESTs from diverse tissues and cell lines.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Significantly, even though the intronless PSH2 might be predicted to be a non-translated pseudogene resulting from retrotransposition of an ancestral PSH mRNA, it does in fact appear to be expressed, at least at the mRNA level.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In these initial non-quantitative RT to PCR experiments, expression of PSH2 appeared to be lower than that of other PSHs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	112	 More rigorous analysis of relative expression levels will be needed to determine the relative abundance of each of the PSH transcripts.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	113	The identification of a novel family of PS homologues is likely to lead to insights into PS function and evolution.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	114	 By inference from PSs, a diaspartyl peptidase function for PSHs is plausible.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	115	 However it is perhaps unlikely that PSHs cleave known PS substrates, since the PSH family, represented among the archaea and eukaryotes, appear to have arisen considerably before the appearance of PSs, Ass, Notch and ErbB4.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Moreover, double knockout of PS1 and PS2 appears sufficient to abolish -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch (18,19).
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In any case, additional experiments will need to be conducted to determine whether or not any of the PSHs can cleave known -secretase substrates.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Based on their apparent expression in the brain, it is unlikely that known -secretase substrates are major substrates for the PSHs.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, as has been shown for other enzyme families, the identification of a wider repertoire of PS/PSH family members may now facilitate a greater understanding of the molecular and cellular functions of this biomedically important family.
0.37338918.11978763.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In particular, given the interest in developing -secretase inhibitors that target PSs as potential therapeutic agents in AD (1), information gathered by studying this protein family may offer important insights into the potential catalytic mechanisms and substrate-specificities of PS and PSH that will aid the development of such inhibitors.

0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   Loci underlying autosomal dominant forms of most neurodegenerative disease have been identified: prion mutations cause Gerstmann Straussler syndrome and hereditary Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, tau mutations cause autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia, and -synuclein mutations cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In all these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and in these cases the whole protein is deposited.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in APP or presenilin 1 or 2 cause autosomal dominant disease and these are the substrate and proteases, respectively, which are responsible for the production of the deposited peptide, Ass.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Thus, in all cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We briefly review this remarkably predictable biology, but also point out that it seems sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed to by genetic variability at the same loci, strongly suggesting that the quantity of the normal protein produced influences risk for the sporadic forms of the disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The evidence for this assertion is strongest in Parkinson's disease (PD), where genetic variability in -synuclein expression affects risk of developing disease, although the oldest evidence for the notion that increased expression of normal sequence protein can lead to disease comes from the observation of Alzheimer's disease in trisomy 21 cases.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	9	 From these observations, we make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in general.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   In the last 15 years there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the etiology of the autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The loci underlying the autosomal dominant forms of Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease (1), frontal temporal dementia (2) and Parkinson's disease have been identified (3).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In each case, the underlying locus has encoded the protein that is often deposited in the disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, this is the prion protein: in frontal temporal dementia, it is tau, and in Parkinson's disease it is -synuclein.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is a little more complex in that the deposited peptide, Ass, is derived from a fragment of the APP protein when metabolized by the -secretase complex: a key component of this complex are the presenilins and mutations in either APP or presenilin 1 or 2 can lead to disease (4 to 6).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	15	These findings are well established and have driven therapeutics research, especially because they have allowed the development of animal models of these diseases as well as defined therapeutic targets (7).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	18	By studying the autosomal dominant forms of these and other diseases, researchers hope to gain insight into the more common, sporadic forms, and from a mechanistic perspective, this has certainly been the case.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, perhaps more surprisingly, over this last 4 years, it has become clear that, in the case of many of these diseases at least, the haplotype of the Mendelian pathogenic locus influences the disease risk for sporadic disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	20	In this review, we briefly summarise these data, and then make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	21	 First, though, it is worth noting what a  haplotypic association  means from a mechanistic perspective: in the absence of coding changes, a haplotypic association implies there is genetic variability either in the amount of expression of the protein, or in the alternate splicing of the protein, and that this contributes to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	22	   THE DISEASES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   Prion diseases The prion gene has two common coding variants in Caucasian populations: one with prion M129 the other with prion V129 (9,10).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It has long been recognized that homozygosity at codon 129 predisposes to sporadic disease, presumably because of the necessity of prion to prion interactions and symmetry considerations (9,10).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, in addition to this well-established risk, recent genetic data have shown that the prion haplotype confers additional risk to idiopathic disease (11), clearly suggesting that genetic variability in prion expression contributes to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	25	 While these genetic data do not establish whether high expressors or low expressors are more susceptible, and since prion knockout mice are completely resistant to disease (12), it is most parsimonious to expect that those who express high levels of prion protein, and are homozygotes at codon 129, are most susceptible to disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	26	Alzheimer's disease Extensive sequencing of the APP gene in late-onset Alzheimer's disease has failed to identify mutations (13).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	31	Frontal temporal dementia: tangle diseases Mutations in the tau gene cause many cases of autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia in which there is tau pathology.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	32	 There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	33	 There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	38	Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia Mutations in the -synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, and -synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathognomic feature of Parkinson's disease (25).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Genetic variability in the -synuclein promoter contributes to the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (26,27) with the  associated  promoter allele being a stronger promoter (28).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	43	   METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   The problems of the assessment of haplotypic expression Rigorous assessment of the impact of haplotypic variation on quantitative gene expression and splicing is a surprisingly difficult problem (32).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The usual method to test variability in the control of expression is to tie an artificial and arbitrary reporter construct to a bacterially-derived reporter gene and measure its transient effect on expression in a tumor-derived cell line.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Clearly such experiments are unlikely to yield data of direct relevance to subtle effects of variation on gene expression.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The development of allele-specific gene expression methods (33,34) offers hope that more subtle effects can be studied although these methods are arduous and require access to large numbers of well-maintained human brain specimens (33).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	47	   CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   In all the diseases referred to above, there is thus strong evidence that, while frank mutations in the pathologic locus cause autosomal dominant disease and protein deposition, genetic variability in expression of the normal protein contributes to the risk of idiopathic disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In Alzheimer's disease, where the deposited protein is a peptide fragment of the primary locus, mutations in the cleaving enzyme also lead to disease.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	49	 These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	50	While these findings were unexpected, perhaps they should not have been.
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	51	 All chemists know the power of the law of mass action, and perhaps it should not have surprised us that it may have profound implications in determining our risks of neurodegenerative disease (36).
0.38811842.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Of course, one therapeutic approach in all cases, therefore, would be to aim to reduce the concentrations of the toxic proteins in the relevant tissue compartment either through decreased production, increased breakdown, or both.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	4	The presenilins (PSs)1 are part of the molecular machinery responsible for cleaving proteins like the ss-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch in the plane of the membrane (Annaert and De Strooper 1999 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Mutations in PS1 are one of the major causes of familiar Alzheimer's disease.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	6	 PSs are also involved in regulating the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway, but how exactly remains a highly controversial issue (for full discussion see www.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	7	org/members/forums/journal/catenin/index.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	8	 2001 provide results to tip the scales definitively in favor of the concept that PS1 operates as a negative regulator of the Wnt/ss-catenin signaling pathway.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	9	ss-catenin, neural plakophilin related armadillo protein (NPRAP, also called -catenin), and p0071 previously were known to bind to the large cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 (see www.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	10	org/members/forums/journal/catenin/index.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These proteins are all characterized by repeats of the armadillo motif, a 42 amino acid sequence involved in protein to protein interactions, however, only the function of ss-catenin has been fairly well established.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	12	 One pool of ss-catenin is bound at the cell membrane to the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	13	 A second pool is located in the cytoplasm in complex with axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3ss (GSK-3ss).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Phosphorylation of ss-catenin by GSK-3ss promotes its binding to the ss-transducing repeat-containing protein (ss-TrCP), an F-box protein, and part of the E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Maniatis 1999 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Upon ubiquitination, ss-catenin becomes rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Fig 1).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Binding of the soluble ligand Wnt to the membrane receptor frizzled inhibits GSK-3ss via a pathway involving casein kinases and the protein disheveled.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This results in the accumulation of unphosphorylated ss-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the cell nucleus.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Here, ss-catenin binds to members of the LEF/TCF (T cell-specific transcription factor 1) family of transcriptional regulators and activates Wnt target genes like cyclin D1, c-myc, and metalloproteases.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus, a finely tuned balance between the three ss-catenin pools at the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus, determines the final outcome of the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig 1, for a detailed overview see www.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	25	However, when the functional relevance of the PS-ss-catenin interaction was investigated, contradictory results were obtained.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	26	 PS1 appeared to either stabilize (Zhang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	27	 1998 ) or destabilize ss-catenin (Kang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Remarkably, clinical PS mutations that cause Alzheimer's disease also affected ss-catenin stability positively or negatively.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Given these contradictory results it remains unclear to what extent these observations contribute to our understanding of the disease (see www.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In an attempt to avoid methodological confusion, Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	32	 2001 have been careful not to overexpress proteins, to use primary cultures (and not large T-transformed cultures) of PS1 knockout fibroblasts, to apply rigorous controls, and to use several functional assays to make their point.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	33	 They convincingly demonstrate that ss-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasmic pool and LEF/TCF gene transcription becomes activated in the absence of PS1.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Their conclusion that presenilin is a negative regulator of the Wnt/ss-catenin pathway gains considerable support from recent in vivo studies in Drosophila melanogaster, showing that an accumulation of armadillo (the Drosophila homologue of ss-catenin) was observed in PS-deficient blastoderm embryos (Noll et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A genetic screen for suppressors of the armadillo phenotype yielded the Drosophila PS (Cox et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	36	An important question is how PS1 affects ss-catenin stability.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Since PS1 can bind GSK-3ss, it is tempting to speculate that it provides a scaffold for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin (Kang et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Interestingly, the ss-catenin interaction site on PS1 contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by GSK-3ss (Kirchenbaum et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	39	 2000 ), suggesting that this interaction is regulated as is the interaction of ss-catenin with the axin/APC/GSK-3ss complex.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	40	 However, from the data of Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	41	 2001 , it appears that PS1 is not needed for the phosphorylation of ss-catenin since phosphorylated ss-catenin species accumulate in PS1 deficient cells.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Furthermore, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, fewer ubiquitinated ss-catenin species are observed in PS1 deficient cells than in wild-type cells (Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Instead, these results suggest that PS1 is needed for the ubiquitination of ss-catenin (but see Noll et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	44	 2000 ) and raise intriguing questions concerning the relationship of PS1 with the ubiquitin ligase machinery and the proteasome (Fig 1).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	45	PS1 is also involved in the Notch 1 signaling pathway.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Notch 1 belongs to a family of large type I integral membrane receptors involved in cell fate decisions.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Upon ligand binding, Notch becomes proteolytically processed.

0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	49	 PS1 functions in the proteolytic complex needed to generate the intramembranous cleavage of Notch, not unlike the cleavage of APP (Kopan and Goate 2000 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The embryonic lethal phenotype of the mice in which the PS1 genes have been inactivated can largely be explained by deficiencies in the Notch signaling system and therefore the physiological relevance of the ss-catenin/PS1 connection in mammals remained somewhat speculative.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	51	 However, as discussed in Soriano et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	52	 2001 , mice that specifically lack expression of PS1 in the skin have been generated (Zheng, H.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These mice develop a spectrum of skin tumors, suggestive of increased ss-catenin activity and the concept that PS1 may act as a repressor of this pathway in adulthood.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	54	Inhibitory cross-talk between the Notch and the Wnt signaling pathways previously was thought to occur at the level of the Notch extracellular domain binding to Wnt (Wesley 1999 ), and at the level of the Notch intracellular domain binding to disheveled (Axelrod et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	55	 PS1 seems now to provide a third level where such interaction could theoretically occur.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Deleting the cytoplasmic loop domain of PS1 annihilates its binding with ss-catenin, whereas the proteolytic cleavage of Notch and APP is maintained (Saura et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The function of PS1 in ss-catenin turnover can thus be separated from its function in -secretase processing.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	58	 As in many biological questions, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans could shed some light on this matter.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	59	 1998 provided evidence that a protein encoded by sel-10, a suppressor of the Notch signaling pathway, associates functionally and physically with SEL-12, the worm's homologue of human PS.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	60	 SEL10 is related to the CDC4 family of F box/WD40 repeat containing proteins.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	61	 These proteins are part of the E3-enzymes of the ubiquitin-ligation pathway and appear to function as adapters that recruit target proteins to a complex containing the E2 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Maniatis 1999 ).
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	62	 More than 30 mammalian homologues including ss-TrCP have been identified (Winston et al.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The challenge now is to find out whether PS1 provides a scaffold for ss-TrCP or other members of the F-box protein family and ubiquitin-ligase substrates like ss-catenin.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	64	 It also will be important to establish whether the current findings can be extended to other proteins that bind to PS, e.
0.43037122.11266476.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In conclusion, PS1 is involved in at least two proteolytic machines regulating signal transduction cascades: regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and APP on one hand (Brown et al.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	123	Identification of QM/Jif-1, a Negative Regulator of c-Jun, as a Binding Protein to PS1 We have investigated the function of PS1 by isolating the molecules that interact with PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	124	 We screened a human embryonic brain library using the yeast two-hybrid system.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	125	 After double second screens using leucine-deficient plates and X-gal plates, we finally judged six clones showing strong interaction to be positive.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	126	 In our experience with the two-hybrid system, this number of positive clones was small compared with other baits.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Among them, we found a clone identical to QM/Jif-1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This molecule was isolated originally as a putative Wilms's tumor suppressor gene (Dowdy et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	129	 1991 ), then described as a transcription factor that interacts with c-Jun and inhibits its transcriptional activation (Monteclaro and Vogt 1993 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Recently, it was shown to be identical to a ribosomal protein, L10 (Chan et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	131	 1996 ), which was therefore suggested to be a ribosomal protein possessing multiple extraribosomal functions (Wool 1996 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	132	This clone (PS309-4) lacked an NH2-terminal portion of 43 amino acids and encoded a variant Ser202Asn (Fig 1 a).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	133	 QM/Jif-1 does not possess a leucine zipper but might compose a C2H2-type zinc finger (Fig 1 a).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Retransformation of EGY48 yeast cells by pEGPS1 and pJGPS309-4 plasmids showed high ss-galactosidase activities in independent yeast colonies (Fig 1 b).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	135	To determine the binding domain of PS1 molecule to QM/Jif-1, we performed deletion analysis of PS1 by two-hybrid assay.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	136	 cDNAs corresponding to various regions of the PS1 molecule were subcloned into the pEG vector and cotransfected with pJG309-4 into yeast cells.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Interestingly, any partial sequence of PS1 did not bind strongly to QM/Jif-1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Instead, full-length PS1 showed a strong interaction with QM/Jif-1 (Fig 1 c).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	139	 This finding corresponds well to the results of Western blot analysis using human brains described below.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	140	In Vivo Interaction between QM/Jif-1 and PS1 To verify the interaction between QM and PS1 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation assay with human brains, including those of familial and nonfamilial AD patients.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Approximately 50 kD full-length PS1 was detected in the precipitates by N and by L from normal, disease control (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), nonfamilial AD, and PS1-linked AD brains (Fig 2 a), whereas we could not observe clear bands corresponding to the cleaved PS1 fragments.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	142	 This result in human brain, together with the results from two-hybrid deletion analyses (Fig 1 c), suggest that multiple regions in the full-length structure of PS1 are necessary for tight interaction with QM/Jif-1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	143	 This idea might have some relationship to the recent finding that NH2- and COOH-terminal PS1 fragments reassociate and form a stable complex (Capell et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	144	Interestingly, the band was visible but very weak in lanes 6 and 7 loaded with samples from PS1-linked AD patients (Fig 2 a).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Compared with the PS1 bands in Western blot analysis using the same brain samples (Fig 2 b), it is not due to difference of the PS1 protein amounts among brain samples.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Instead, it could be due to the difference of residual neurons where QM and PS1 may interact, among samples, or due to the difference in affinity of QM to normal and mutant PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In the reverse immunoprecipitation assay, we detected QM in precipitates by N as well as by L (Fig 2 c), reconfirming the interaction between PS1 and QM/Jif1 in vivo.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We performed immunoprecipitation with nonimmune sera and with several nonspecific antisera using the same brain samples, but did not find QM or PS1 in the precipitates (data not shown).

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	150	 As QM expression has not been reported previously, we confirmed that the QM message is widely expressed in the brain by Northern blot analysis (Fig 3).

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	152	 To further characterize subcellular localization of the QM protein, we observed the mouse brain sample with electronmicroscopy and found that regions very close to tubular membrane structures, which possessed features of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, were predominantly stained (Fig 4b and Fig c).

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	169	Next, we asked whether the QM and PS1 proteins are colocalized in the human brain neurons.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with secondary antibodies conjugated to different sizes of gold particles and with the brain of a 37-yr-old woman who died due to loss of blood.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	171	 We observed that the 5-nm grain of PS1 and 10-nm grain of QM were located very close to each other at the edge of smooth membrane structures in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons (Fig 4 d).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Most of those structures seemed to be smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas some of them possessed the features of Golgi apparatus (data not shown).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Fewer grains were observed also in the nucleus (Fig 4 e).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Although the immunoreactivity was further reduced in the formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of nonfamilial or PS1-linked AD brains, we repeatedly found that these two grains were colocalized at membrane structure in the cytoplasm (Fig 4, f to i).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	175	PS1 Suppresses the Action of c-jun Homodimer Next, we investigated the biological significance of the interaction between QM/Jif-1 and PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Jif-1 was isolated as a protein binding to c-Jun from a cDNA library screened with biotinylated c-Jun (Monteclaro and Vogt 1993 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Work by Monteclaro and Vogt on the function of Jif-1 has shown that GST to QM/Jif-1 fusion proteins do not bind to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE) in gel mobility shift assays, but prevent the binding of a c-Jun homodimer to the TRE (Monteclaro and Vogt 1993 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Moreover, the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer can override this inhibition by Jif-1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Through this binding inhibition, Jif-1 inhibits gene transactivation by c-Jun.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	180	 QM/Jif-1 is extremely conserved during evolution from yeast to mammal (Farmer et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	181	 1994 ), suggesting that this factor is essential for basic cellular functions.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	182	 From these observations, we supposed that expression of PS1 might affect the function of c-Jun through interaction with QM.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	183	To test this hypothesis, we performed cotransfection chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays with c-jun or c-fos expression vectors as the first effector plasmid, normal or mutant PS1 expression vectors as the second effector plasmid (Fig 5 a), and human collagenase (-517/-42) TKCAT vector containing TRE as reporter plasmid.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	184	 We used F9 embryonic carcinoma cells in the assays because they possess almost no activated protein (AP)-1 activity (Angel et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	185	 1988 ), but express enough of the QM protein (data not shown).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	186	 It was difficult to predict what kind of results would emerge with the addition of the PS1 expression vector, because the binding might keep QM in the endoplasmic reticulum where PS1 is most abundant (Kovacs et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	187	 1996 ), or it might assist the transport of QM to the nucleus where PS1 immunoreactivity is also detected (Li et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	188	 It could be that cotransfection might not affect CAT activities due to a nonfunctional binding between the two molecules.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This suppressive effect was considered to be specific, because overexpression of a multipass transmembrane protein, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), which is known to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, did not suppress CAT activity (Fig 5 b).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The weak transactivation by c-Fos, which might have been induced with a weak endogenous c-Jun activity, was not influenced by either normal or mutant PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	211	 These observations corresponded very well with the interacting behavior of QM to AP-1 molecules reported previously (Monteclaro and Vogt 1993 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The suppression by mutant PS1 seemed weaker than that by normal PS1 (Fig 5 b).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	213	To examine whether the effect of PS1 is mediated by TRE, we changed the reporter plasmid to those that contained only TRE (Fig 5 a).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	214	 As expected, PS1 reproduced suppression of the c-Jun to mediated transactivation in collagenase 1x TRE CAT and metallothionein IIa 1x TRE CAT (Fig 5 c).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	215	 These results supported our hypothesis that PS1 affects gene regulation by c-jun through TRE.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Interestingly, by using 1x TRE CAT plasmids, we observed more clearly that the suppression of c-Jun to induced transactivation was weaker in mutant PS1 than in normal PS1 (Fig 5 c).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	217	PS1 Represses Transactivation by junD but Not by junB Second, we tested whether PS1 affects transcriptional regulation by the other c-jun family members forming an AP-1 complex.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Expression of junB and junD enhanced transcription from collagenase 1x TRE CAT reporter plasmid (Fig 5 d).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Transactivation by junD was clearly suppressed by expression of normal and mutant PS1, whereas transactivation by junB was not affected (Fig 5 d).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In this case, suppression of junD-mediated transactivation by normal PS1 was not remarkably different from that by mutant PS1 (Fig 5 d), in contrast to our observations with c-jun to mediated transactivation (Fig 5b and Fig c).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	221	 In the CAT assays described above, we confirmed that expression of the c-Jun protein was not influenced by cotransfecting PS1, and that expression of normal and mutant PS1 proteins was equivalent (Fig 5 e).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	222	 We summarized results from all the CAT assays described above with a histogram showing mean fold transactivations (Fig 5 f).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	223	PS1 Promotes Translocation of QM/Jif-1 to the Nucleus From the data described above, we hypothesized that PS1 somehow promotes translocation of the QM protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, inhibits the binding of c-Jun homodimer to TRE, and thereby suppresses transactivation by c-jun.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	224	 We used a fluorescent protein (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]) fusion reporter plasmid to observe how intracellular transport of the QM protein is modulated by PS1, and observed that translocation of the fusion protein to the nucleus is actually accelerated by cotransfecting PS1 (Fig 6 a).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	225	 On the other hand, coexpression of mutant (Met146Leu) PS1 did not remarkably promote the nuclear translocation.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	227	 (a) Translocation of EGFP-QM fusion protein to the nucleus was promoted by cotransfecting normal PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	228	 When pEGFQM was transfected alone into F9 cells, it was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	229	 By coexpressing normal PS1, distribution of the EGFP-QM fusion protein was shifted to the nucleus.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	230	 This nuclear translocation was not obvious when mutant (Met146Leu) PS1 was coexpressed.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Expression of normal and mutant PS1 proteins was equivalent in Western blot analysis performed similarly to Fig 5 e.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Percentage of nuclear translocation was calculated by (number of cells with stronger fluorescence in the nucleus)/(total number of fluorescence-positive cells) x 100.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	236	 10  microg of each plasmid was transfected by calcium phosphate method and nuclear extract was prepared 36 h after transfection.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Oligonucleotide corresponding to metallothionein IIa TRE was radiolabeled with Klenow enzyme and used as the probe.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Cotransfection of normal PS1 remarkably suppressed the binding of c-Jun homodimer, whereas mutant PS1 suppressed weakly.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The DNA to protein complex of the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer and JunB homodimer was not remarkably affected.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	240	 The complex of the JunD homodimer was inhibited weakly.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	241	It is interesting to note that the effects of PS1 on transcription and on protein transport were remarkable although the expression level of PS1 was not as high as that of PS1 (Fig 5 e), or as the endogenous expression level of QM/Jif-1 (data not shown).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	242	 Considered with the function of PS1 assisting the nuclear transport of QM, transfected PS1 molecule might be recycled efficiently in cells, leading to the remarkable effect on c-Jun function via QM protein translocated to and accumulated in the nucleus.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	243	Next, we performed gel mobility shift assays by using nuclear extracts prepared from F9 cells expressing AP-1 transcription factors with or without PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We found that PS1 suppresses the binding of c-Jun homodimer to TRE and very weakly suppresses that of JunD homodimer but not that of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer or JunB homodimer (Fig 6 b).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Furthermore, normal PS1 suppressed the binding to TRE more efficiently than mutant PS1 (Fig 6 b).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	246	 These findings are consistent with the results in CAT assay (Fig 5, a to f) and support the idea that the nuclear translocation of QM/Jif-1 is promoted by normal PS1 thereby inhibiting the binding of c-Jun homodimer to TRE.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	247	We tested another possibility that PS1 inhibits JNK and thereby suppresses transactivation by c-jun (for review see Minden and Karin 1997 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	248	 T7-Tag-JNK1 expression vector was cotransfected with PS1, immunoprecipitated, and the JNK activity was tested with c-Jun produced in bacteria as a substrate.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In this assay, we observed no change of JNK activity (data not shown).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	250	 This finding indicates that PS1 represses the function of c-jun predominantly through the transport of QM/Jif-1, but not through c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK, although further analyses are necessary to determine whether or not JNK is partially involved in the suppression by PS1.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	258	 These findings indicated that AP-1 plays important roles in cell death, although each member of the AP-1 complex might play a different role.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	259	Considering these previous data, we examined whether PS1 affects c-jun to mediated apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	260	 We used F9 cells for this analysis, since retinoic acid treatment induces apoptosis (Atencia et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	261	 1994 ) and upregulation of the c-jun expression (Yamaguchi-Iwai et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	262	 Suppression of c-jun by the antisense transcript expression reduced the retinoic acid to induced apoptosis (Fig 7 a), indicating that c-jun mediates this type of cell death.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Thus, we made stable transformants expressing >10 times the amount of PS1 protein than parental F9 cells (Fig 7 b), and observed the effect of PS1 on retinoic acid to induced apoptosis.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Normal PS1 significantly suppressed the percentage of apoptotic cells, whereas mutant PS1 suppressed it rather weakly.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	266	 These results were consistently observed in the stable cell lines with high expression (n = 3).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	267	 In addition, we confirmed these results by DNA fragmentation in cellular nuclei (Fig 7 e).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	268	 The weak antiapoptotic effect of mutant PS1 corresponds well to its weak suppressive effect on c-jun to induced transactivation in CAT assays (Fig 5b, Fig c, and Fig f).

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	288	 First, we made various deletion constructs of QM/Jif-1 (Fig 8 a) and tested their binding to PS1 by pull-down assay.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	289	 Normal or mutant (Met146Leu) PS1 radiolabeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription/translation were interacted with GST fusion proteins of QM in vitro and pulled down by glutathione Sepharose 4B.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	308	Next, we tested whether deletion of zif affects transcriptional regulation.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	309	 As QM/Jif-1 is abundantly expressed in all the cell lines, we designed a dominant negative experiment.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	310	 We selected F9PS1 cells in which transfected QM is translocated to the nucleus.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Eukaryotic expression vectors containing the deletion constructs of QM were cotransfected with c-jun, and QM expression vectors into F9PS1 cells.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Transfection of full-length QM suppressed c-jun to induced transactivation (Fig 8 c, lanes 2 and 3).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	313	 1 antagonized this suppression by QM.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	314	 The CAT activities in cotransfection of 1 (Fig 8 c, lanes 4 and 5) was higher than those in c-jun to induced transactivation (Fig 8 c, lane 2), suggesting that 1 antagonized endogenous QM in addition to transfected QM.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	315	 This dominant negative effect was not observed in the other constructs without zif that cannot interact with PS1 (Fig 8 c, lanes 6 to 9).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Therefore, 1 probably inhibits binding of QM to PS1 in a competitive manner and represses the function of QM, since 1 transported to the nucleus does not have a suppressive effect on c-Jun.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Consistently, translocation to the nucleus of the GFP fusion protein was observed in 1 but not in the other deletion constructs lacking zif (Fig 8 d).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Without transfecting c-jun expression vector, transactivation by 1 itself was not observed in F9PS1 cells, which do not express c-jun (data not shown).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	319	Finally, we tested the role of zif in the c-jun to associated apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	320	 F9PS1 cells were transfected with the vectors expressing deleted QM/Jif-1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Transfection of 1 increased the percentage of cell death induced by retinoic acid treatment, whereas the other constructs did not affect the apoptosis (Fig 8 e).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	322	 This result again showed the dominant negative effect of 1 on apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	323	 Collectively, it was concluded that zif is essential for the interaction of QM with PS1 and for the effects of QM on c-Jun derived from the interaction.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	325	This study showed that PS1 binds to a negative cofactor of c-Jun, QM/Jif-1, and that PS1 regulates the functions of c-jun in transcription and cell death.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Promotion of the nuclear translocation of QM/Jif-1 by PS1 seems to be the underlying mechanism that connects the first and second conclusions.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	327	 A specific point in our results is that QM/Jif-1 binds to a full-length PS1.

0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	337	 However, it might be explained by supposing that PS1 functions as a kind of intracellular transporter with a relatively low specificity.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	338	 The multipass transmembrane structure of PS1, especially of the full-length form, does not contradict this hypothesis, and this kind of activity was actually shown in the case of amyloid protein transport (Naruse et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	339	 Our observation on the nuclear translocation of QM/Jif-1 is also compatible with this idea.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	340	Activation of c-jun, especially that mediated by JNK, has been suggested to participate in various types of cell death, including TNF- or Fas-induced apoptosis (Verheij et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	341	 Numerous reports keep emerging on this apoptotic cascade.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	342	 JNK was reported to enhance apoptosis induced by a breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, through activation of GADD45 (Harkin et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The JNK-dependent apoptotic pathway has been implicated in the morphogenesis of Drosophila wing (Adachi-Yamada et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	344	 Furthermore, kainic acid to induced apoptosis in the hippocampus was prevented in the mice lacking the Jnk3 gene (Yang et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	345	 1997 ), indicating that JNK3 is essential for this type of apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	346	 The role of JNK in kainic acid to induced apoptosis was reconfirmed in the knock-in mice carrying mutations at JNK-phosphorylation sites of the c-jun gene (Behrens et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In the AD brain, the increase of c-Jun immunoreactivity was observed and strongly correlated with pathological changes (Anderson et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	348	 Mutations in PS1 might influence such cascades at the final step of c-Jun and thereby affect apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	349	 Since our results showed that the inhibitory effect of mutant PS1 on c-jun to mediated apoptosis was weaker than that of normal PS1, mutation in PS1 could be a promoting factor in c-jun to mediated apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	350	However, there remain debates on the role of c-jun and JNK in the in vivo apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	351	 Although double gene disruption of Jnk1 and Jnk2 leads to severe dysregulation of apoptosis during development at specific regions in the brain, Jnk3 does not affect this apoptosis (Kuan et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	352	 c-jun was reported to be dispensable in developmental cell death and axogenesis of the retina (Herzog et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	353	 These discrepancies might suggest that the c-Jun/JNK cascade plays different roles in the developmental neuronal death and in the death of the mature neuron.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	354	 Therefore, our results on the cascade from PS1 to c-Jun should be applied carefully to different types of cell death.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	355	The functions of normal and mutant PS1 in cell death reported so far are still difficult to combine (for review see Barinaga 1998 ).
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	356	 Normal PS1 had been reported to promote cell death basically via affecting the Ass metabolism.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	357	 Meanwhile, accumulating data from independent laboratories indicated that PS1 also modifies various cell death cascades.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	358	 It suppresses apoptosis associated with p53 and p21WAF1 activation (Roperch et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	359	 1998 ) and promotes the antiapoptotic function of ss-catenin (Zhang, Z.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	360	 In these cases, normal PS1 suppresses cell death, whereas mutations in PS1 abort this function.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	361	Suppression of c-Jun homodimer by PS1 might lead to a different outcome in signaling pathways other than the c-jun to mediated apoptosis examined in this study.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	362	 For example, neurotrophins bind to tyrosine kinase to type membrane receptors and activate c-Jun through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	363	 Many other trophic factors, including fibroblast (FGF), epidermal (EGF), platelet-derived (PDGF), and hepatocyte growth factors (HGF), induce similar signaling cascades and promote cell survival.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	364	 In such a condition where the activation of c-Jun mainly contributes to survival, PS1 might promote apoptosis.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Like neurotrophins which transduce survival and death signalings via the high affinity and low affinity receptors, respectively (for review see Dechant and Barde 1997 ), PS1 might transduce both types of signalings via different molecules binding to PS1.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	366	In other words, our results might have proposed another type of explanation for why PS1 induces diverse effects on the cell fate.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	367	 The PS1/QM/c-Jun cascade leads to the opposite outcome, survival or death, depending on the final effect of c-Jun, which is influenced by cellular conditions.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	368	 Although it is not yet known which factors define the attitude of c-Jun in cells, other types of signaling cascades induced by PS1, including calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (Guo et al.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	369	 1996 ) and G protein signaling (for review see Nishimoto 1998 ), might cross-talk and change the responding manner of cells to the c-Jun activation.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	370	In the AD brains, which usually degenerate for more than several years, it is possible that both c-jun to associated and c-jun to nonassociated neuronal deaths occur in various situations.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Although apoptosis itself is a rather rapid process in a single neuron, it occurs in numerous neurons of the brain at random and so the mass degeneration of the brain proceeds gradually.
0.32998833.10508860.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Therefore, we are speculating that c-jun to mediated apoptosis influenced by PS1 might be an additive factor to modify neuronal fate in the AD brain, and could function in parallel with the amyloid deposition promoted by PS mutations as well as the pathogenic mechanisms mediated by other binding proteins.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	18	Human PS1 and PS2 genes are both ubiquitously expressed, but at low protein levels which have lead to difficulties and inconsistencies in their detection and localization.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	32	 First, the Caenorhabditis elegans presenilin homologue, sel-12, facilitates Notch-based cell signaling of lin-12, a gene involved in cell fate determination and vulva development (see Levitan and Greenwald, 1995).

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Although these results clearly allude to a role for presenilins in development, the mechanisms by which FAD mutations in presenilin genes cause AD are unknown.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Interestingly, mice disrupted of PS1 can be rescued by human transgenes containing FAD-linked PS mutations, indicating that the FAD mutations do not affect PS functions related to embryo development in mammals (Davis et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	37	 elegans sel-12 mutant is more able to discriminate between wild-type and FAD bearing PS transgenes, being functionally rescued by expression of wild-type human presenilins but only partially by presenilins containing FAD mutations (Levitan et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The FAD-linked PS mutations are thought to confer some unknown detrimental gain of function which correlates with altered APP processing (see Davis et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	39	Presenilins have also been implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Evidence for such a role was first shown when a cDNA fragment encoding the 103 COOH-terminal amino acids of mouse PS2, termed ALG-3, was isolated in a screen for cDNAs that could rescue T cells from receptor-induced apoptosis (Vito et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	41	 This rescue appears to be a consequence of the ALG-3 fragment acting in a dominant negative fashion, since expression of full-length PS2 leads to apoptosis (Vito et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Compared with the apoptosis induced by the overexpression of wild-type PS2 in PC12 and HeLa cells, the FAD PS2-N141I mutation causes even higher levels of apoptosis (Deng et al.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	48	To gain a better understanding of presenilin function, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins with which human PS2 interacts.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Using the loop region of PS2 as bait we have isolated and characterized a recently identified calcium-binding protein that binds preferentially to PS2 compared with PS1 loop sequence.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This protein, calmyrin, displays several interesting properties including myristoylation, membrane-association, and colocalization with PS2 in cotransfected cells.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Like presenilin, calmyrin causes cell death when overexpressed in HeLa cells, and interestingly, coexpression of PS2 and calmyrin promotes an additive increase in cell death.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	170	 After finding that our initial PS2-loop construct (residues 270-361) self-activated transcription, we truncated the bait reducing it to the first 50 amino acids in order to eliminate several acidic residues and designated it PS2-loop B (B for bait; Fig.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Clones that produced the specific interaction phenotype were sequenced and identified via BLAST homology database search.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Interestingly, three of the interactors were independent cDNAs all containing the full coding sequence of a recently identified calcium-binding protein, but with varying NH2-terminal untranslated extensions.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Two other groups have recovered this calcium-binding protein in yeast two-hybrid screens and have named it CIB, for its calcium- and integrin IIb-binding ability (Naik et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	177	, 1997), and KIP, due to its interaction with eukaryotic DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PKcs (Wu and Lieber, 1997).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Rather than pick between these two names we have chosen to refer to this protein as calmyrin (for calcium-binding myristoylated protein with homology to calcineurin) because it describes its inherent properties without bias towards its multiple binding partners.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	179	To quantify the binding specificity of calmyrin to the PS2-loop and to determine if this protein also interacts with the PS1 loop which is 45% identical in amino acid sequence, we measured the -galactosidase activity in yeast liquid assays.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	180	 When cotransformed with calmyrin, the PS2-loop B bait produced an 8.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	181	5-fold increase in -galactosidase activity over the lamin B negative control, while the corresponding region of PS1 (PS1-loop B) produced only a 1.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	183	 A PS2-COOH-terminal construct, containing the COOH-terminal 39- amino acid sequence downstream of the eighth TMD also did not appear to interact with calmyrin.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	184	To further map the binding site of calmyrin within the PS2-loop, two new baits were constructed which divided the loop into a conserved portion, loop C (28 out of the 31 amino acids are identical to PS1), and a divergent region, loop D (only 33% identity to PS1; Fig 1 A).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Since calmyrin did not interact preferentially with the comparable loop region of PS1 (PS1-loop B) we expected the calmyrin binding site to be within the divergent region of the PS2-loop sequence (PS2-loop D).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	186	 To our surprise, the PS2-loop D bait interacted very weakly with calmyrin, a 2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	187	2-fold increase over control (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, the highly conserved region of the PS2 loop, PS2-loop C, produced a 74-fold increase in activity (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	189	 In comparison, the corresponding PS1-loop C construct increased activity only 5.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	190	Although the two PS-loop C baits are highly conserved in sequence, they differ by three amino acids, with PS1 containing threonine residues at positions 281 and 291 instead of proline and alanine, respectively (see Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	191	 1 A, numbered according to PS1), and a leucine instead of an isoleucine at position 282.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	192	 We investigated how these three divergent residues influenced calmyrin interaction with the PS-loop C region in yeast two-hybrid assays by introducing the PS2 amino acids into the PS1 bait, so that each of the three divergent residues were mutated singly, and in every possible combination, to the corresponding PS2 sequence.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	193	 These data indicated that all three residues contributed in different and complex ways towards the interaction (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Interestingly, calmyrin interaction was restored to approximately half the PS2 level by single mutation of residue 281 to a proline, a residue which would be predicted to introduce a kink in the loop.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	195	 In comparison, single mutation of residue 282 to an isoleucine did not increase binding to any significant extent, whereas mutation of residue 291 to an alanine increased binding to a third that of the PS2 level.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Double mutants confirmed the importance of residues 281 and 291.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	197	 When both proline and alanine were present together (T281P, T291A) they increased binding substantially, producing an approximately twofold higher level of binding compared with the wild-type PS2-loop bait.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This mutant suggests that isoleucine at residue 282 in PS2 may actually compromise binding, as this would be equivalent to the triple substitution (T281P, L282I, T291A; i.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	199	, turning it back to the PS2 sequence).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Consistent with this expectation, isoleucine 282, when present together with alanine 291, did not increase binding above that of the latter alone, whereas paradoxically when it was substituted together with proline 281 it increased binding 1.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	201	7-fold higher than when proline was substituted alone.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	202	The 191-amino acid sequence of calmyrin has a number of notable features (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Sequence comparison indicates that calmyrin is most closely related to human calcineurin B, the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2B, sharing 25% identity and 44% overall similarity.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The prediction was that the myc tag (MEQKLISEEDLN) fused at the NH2-terminal end would disrupt myristoylation since it moved the glycine residue that is essential for myristoylation more downstream (Olshevskaya et al.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The lower panel of this figure contains an immunoblot of these same HeLa cell lysates to show that both NH2- and COOH-terminally tagged calmyrin proteins were expressed efficiently and to equivalent levels, whereas untagged calmyrin accumulated at lower protein levels, explaining the fainter myristoylated calmyrin band seen in lane 6 as compared with lane 4.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	252	 In fact, when the ratio of calmyrin protein to radioactive 3H-myristic acid labeling is compared for C-myc-tagged and wild-type calmyrin proteins they are similar, which is expected since myristoylation is thought to occur cotranslationally (Wilcox et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	253	 The reason for higher expression of C- and N-myc- tagged calmyrin proteins is not known but perhaps fusion of the myc epitope affects protein stability or toxicity, allowing the proteins to accumulate to higher levels.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	295	 (E) Contrastingly, N-myc calmyrin protein accumulates predominantly in the nucleus and produces a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	300	 Another indication that these two proteins bind each other was seen in a small subset of cells where calmyrin and PS2 colocalized distinctively in unusual intranuclear spots (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	301	 The intranuclear spots did not colocalize with anti-centromere staining by double immunofluorescent microscopy (data not shown) suggesting that they are distinct from the PS-immunoreactive structures observed by Li et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The shift in calmyrin localization and the nearly identical staining patterns between PS2 and calmyrin (see merged images) in these coexpressing cells provide persuasive evidence that these two proteins interact in vivo.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Furthermore, when calmyrin was cotransfected with a PS2 construct deleted of the loop and all sequence COOH-terminal of it, the staining patterns displayed significantly less overlap; as seen by patchy aggregates of PS2 which excluded calmyrin (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	304	 The failure of this PS2 deletion construct to completely colocalize with calmyrin in aggregates, which contrasts with the colocalization of the wild-type PS2 protein and calmyrin in nuclear inclusions, enhances our view that the PS2-loop region facilitates binding of calmyrin.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	314	 After trying various combinations of affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with GST fusion proteins, in vitro translated proteins, and HeLa cell-expressed proteins under several different buffer conditions, two of these experiments provided further evidence for the binding of calmyrin and PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	315	 First, HeLa cell lysates of overexpressed PS2 were incubated with purified GST-calmyrin, or GST alone, (shown in Fig.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	317	 The two Sepharose columns were then washed, and retention of PS2 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-PS2 antibody.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	331	Since we had previously shown that overexpression of PS2 in HeLa cells causes apoptosis (Janicki and Monteiro, 1997), we wished to determine what effect overexpression of calmyrin would have on cell viability.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	332	 To detect apoptosis we used the M30 CytoDEATH antibody.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	333	 This mouse monoclonal binds an epitope of cytokeratin 18 which is exposed only after caspase cleavage, an early event in apoptosis (Caulin et al.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	348	Cotransfection of PS2 and calmyrin induced even higher apoptosis.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	349	 To convey more clearly the high levels of apoptosis that resulted from overexpressing these two proteins, example images captured at low magnification are provided.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	350	 8 C shows that at 16 h after cotransfection almost 13% of PS2-expressing cells (which presumably also expressed calmyrin since PS2 and calmyrin staining showed a near 1:1 correspondence [data not shown]) on coverslips were positive for CytoDEATH staining.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	351	 By 40 h the proportion of apoptotic cells had increased to ~50% of the PS2-stained cells.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	352	 The high level of apoptosis seen on coverslips was striking, especially since this method only captured a brief "window" of the cells progression into apoptosis as during programmed cell death HeLa cells lose their adherence on coverslips and float away into the media.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	353	 This phenomenon explains the reduction in total cells, and most notably PS-expressing cells (only 10 cells), remaining on the coverslip at 40 h after cotransfection (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	354	 8 only a subset of PS overexpressing cells were apoptotic, indicating a time-dependent process, whereas the corollary that all apoptotic cells were also overexpressors always held true.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	355	 In contrast when a control protein, the neurofilament light (NF-L) subunit, was overexpressed in HeLa cells (Fig.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	356	 8 E), minimal apoptosis ( <  1%) was detected and total cell counts and expression levels remained high even at 40 h.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	357	 It is remarkable that the single apoptotic cell in this field did not stain for NF-L and that, conversely, there are several rounded-up and highly expressing cells (presumably those in mitosis), none of which appeared apoptotic.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Fields of cells overexpressing calmyrin or PS2 individually showed levels of apoptosis above the neurofilament background, but less than coexpressors.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	359	 Unfortunately, due to variation between (and even within) coverslips, this method did not prove suitable for statistically significant quantification.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	360	Because CytoDEATH labeling on coverslips only captured a narrow "window" of cells undergoing apoptosis, we decided to quantify the total amount of cell death accumulated over time by counting the total number of floating cells in the media after transfection with various amounts of plasmid DNAs encoding calmyrin and PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	361	 This simple method was more reliable in quantifying cell death.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	362	 9, transient overexpression of PS2 increased cell death in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cell death induced by calmyrin overexpression reached a plateau at 10  microg of transfected DNA.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	363	 More interestingly, when both proteins were coexpressed in the linear cell death range of their respective DNAs, cell death increased 5.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	364	9-fold over the control, compared with 2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	365	4-fold for the same respective transfection amounts of calmyrin and PS2 individually, suggesting that these two proteins have additive effects in promoting cell death.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	366	 When these floating cells were collected and stained with the CytoDEATH antibody, ~85% of the cells stained positive for this marker of apoptosis, bolstering our belief that counting floating cells is a reliable measure of cell death.

0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	372	In this study, we demonstrate by several criteria that human PS2 protein interacts with a recently discovered calcium-binding protein which we refer to as calmyrin.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	373	 First, calmyrin interacts with PS2-loop sequence in yeast two-hybrid assays.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	374	 Second, the two proteins bind to each other by affinity chromatography and can be coimmunoprecipitated.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	375	 Third, the two full-length proteins colocalized when coexpressed in vivo.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	376	 The interaction of calmyrin with PS2 is also noteworthy since it is the first protein, to our knowledge, that interacts preferentially with PS2 (at least by yeast two-hybrid analysis) suggesting distinct functions for the highly homologous presenilin proteins.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	377	Two lines of evidence favor the PS2-loop region as the critical site of calmyrin interaction: reduced in vivo colocalization when calmyrin was coexpressed with a loop-deficient PS2 construct and increased yeast liquid culture binding of calmyrin to the PS2-loop rather than the PS2- COOH-terminal domain.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	378	 Deletion analysis indicated that calmyrin binding was mediated primarily by the NH2-terminal 31 amino acids of the PS2-loop.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	379	 Remarkably, despite only a three-amino acid difference, the comparable loop region of PS1 interacted with less than one-tenth the strength in similar yeast two-hybrid assays.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	380	 Site-directed mutagenesis in which the three divergent PS2 residues were introduced singly and in double combinations into PS1 indicated that, in fact, all three amino acids produce variable affects on the specificity of calmyrin for PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	381	 Particularly interesting was the pronounced increased in binding conferred by the conversion of a threonine at positions 281 and 291 in PS1 to proline and alanine, respectively.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	382	 In contrast, the leucine at position 282 in PS1 when converted to isoleucine as in PS2 caused pleotrophic effects, increasing, decreasing, and inducing no change in interaction depending on its context with the other two residues.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	383	 These data suggest that minor alterations in the sequence of the PS loop induce conformational changes in this region with dramatic consequences to protein-protein interactions.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	384	 Furthermore, the loop region is a site associated with several PS-processing phenomena, including proteolytic cleavage, caspase cleavage, as well as abnormal splicing (Perez-Tur et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	385	, 1997; reviewed by Hass, 1997).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	386	 Apart from calmyrin, several other proteins have been found to interact with the PS-loop, namely, -catenin, filamin, calselinin, mu-calpain, and armadillo protein p007 (Zhou et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	387	, 1997; Buxbaum 1998; Murayama et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	388	 Our data showing that minor (single amino acid) alterations in the loop sequence can produce dramatic changes in protein binding not only has implications in terms of calmyrin function, but may also have important consequences for the other processing events and binding partners associated with this region.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	389	 Therefore, it is not surprising that many FAD mutations map to the PS1 loop.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	390	In addition to the importance of protein-protein interactions for localization, our immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical fractionation studies indicate that the myristoylation of calmyrin is important for the dynamic targeting of this protein to several subcellular compartments including: the cytoplasm, long projections of the plasma membrane, and the nucleoplasm.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	391	 Elegant studies of recoverin, a myristoylated calcium-binding protein involved in signaling in the retina, have established that this protein alternates between conformations in which the myristoyl group is exposed or sequestered, conformations that are dependent on calcium binding (Kennedy et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	392	 These calcium-myristoyl switches are a known mechanism for protein targeting and signal transduction.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	393	 Radiolabeling and biochemical studies show that calmyrin is myristoylated and associated with membranes.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	394	 At present, we cannot clearly tease apart the roles that myristoylation and protein-protein interactions play in the in vivo targeting of calmyrin to membranes.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	395	 In fact, our evidence suggests that both are important.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	396	 Yeast two-hybrid assays with loop constructs containing site-directed mutations clearly show the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the association between calmyrin and the integral membrane protein, PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	397	 Additionally, fusion of the Gal4-acidic blob sequence at the NH2-terminal end of calmyrin in the yeast two-hybrid clones would be expected to prevent this fatty acid modification suggesting that myristoylation is not essential for the interaction.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	398	 Paradoxically, however, it is the myristoylated form of calmyrin that we were able to show coimmunoprecipitated with PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	399	 Perhaps insertion of the myristoyl group into the lipid bilayer initiates a conformational change that enhances the affinity of calmyrin for PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	400	 Analogously, the Gal4-acidic blob may have maintained calmyrin in the conformation that was more prone to binding PS2.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	401	Cells overexpressing calmyrin proteins capable of being myristoylated showed greater variation in staining patterns often with increased targeting of calmyrin to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane suggesting that myristoylation may be involved in this dynamic behavior.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	402	 The calmyrin that localized to the cytoplasm had a reticular-like staining pattern which colocalized with PS2 staining when the two proteins were coexpressed.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	403	 We believe that the reticular staining represents targeting of calmyrin protein to the ER since we and others have shown that overexpressed PS2 was localized to the nuclear envelope and ER (see Kovacs et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	404	, 1996; Janicki and Monteiro, 1997).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	405	 Interestingly, in PS2-cotransfected cells relatively little calmyrin was present in the nucleus, and instead, the entire population almost completely colocalized with PS2 at the ER.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	406	 This redistribution to the ER is consistent with the stoichiometric change of binding sites available for calmyrin once PS2 was overexpressed.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	407	 However, the possibility that PS2 expression may alter processing or intracellular targeting of calmyrin can not be ruled out.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	408	As myristoylation is known to be important for membrane targeting, it is curious that a significant pool of calmyrin is present within the nucleoplasm despite the lack of a classical nuclear localization signal.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	409	 Calmyrin is small enough to passively diffuse through the nuclear pores (proteins ~65 kD and larger must be actively transported) and may be sequestered within the nucleoplasm by binding to nuclear resident proteins such as DNA-PKcs which has also been shown to bind calmyrin in yeast two-hybrid assays (Wu and Lieber, 1997).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	410	 The localization of calmyrin to the long projections of the plasma membrane may similarly represent binding to calmyrin's other known interactor, IIb-subunit of integrin.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	411	 These results indicate that calmyrin may traffic between several proteins and factors suggesting a role for calmyrin in complex signaling processes.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	412	 How these processes relate to AD, and/or apoptosis is not known but it is interesting that Volado, a novel integrin which dynamically mediate cell adhesion and signal transduction, was recently identified as a new memory mutant in Drosophila (Grotewiel et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	413	 Also DNA-PKcs is the only known eukaryotic protein kinase activated by DNA double-strand breaks which is a lesion induced during apoptosis (reviewed McConnell and Dynan, 1996; Sheih et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	414	 The possibility that calmyrin, integrins, DNA-PKcs, and PS2 are in any way connected or involved in human diseases is intriguing, yet speculative.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	415	In hypothesizing a physiologic role for the interaction between PS2 and calmyrin, we are especially interested in exploring the involvement of calcium and apoptosis.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	416	 It is noteworthy that calsenilin, another Ca2+-binding protein with sequence similarity to recoverin, binds to the COOH-terminal region of presenilin proteins and like calmyrin redistributes with presenilin proteins in cotransfected cells (Buxbaum, et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	417	 Calmyrin does not share a high degree of amino acid similarity to calsenilin, instead the protein sequence of calmyrin is most homologous to human calcineurin B, the regulatory subunit of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B, which plays important roles in stress, apoptosis, cell calcium signaling, and signal transduction (see Guerini, 1997; Crabtree, 1999; Wang et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	418	 The greatest homology is found in the regions surrounding calcineurin B's four calcium-binding EF hand motifs and its NH2-terminal myristoylation site.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Although these regions are relatively well conserved, sharing 44% overall similarity, calmyrin appears to have only two functional EF hands as the two NH2-terminal motifs contain several insertions that are predicted to disrupt calcium binding.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	420	 (1997) have demonstrated that calmyrin can indeed bind calcium, but it is unknown whether this property regulates phosphatase activity.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	421	 If calmyrin behaves similarly to calcineurin B in phosphatase regulation, it may have some relevance to AD where there is speculation that PHF formation and tau hyperphosphorylation occurs due to misregulation of protein phosphatases or kinases (Matsuo et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	422	Our cell death findings imply that the binding of calmyrin to PS2 may be related to PS2 function in apoptosis.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	423	 In a previous study we found that overexpression of PS2 in HeLa cells induced apoptosis.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	424	 The current finding that coexpression of calmyrin with presenilins in HeLa cells increased apoptosis suggests that the two act in concert in a pathway or pathways regulating cell death.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	425	 Although we have not determined the pathway through which the two proteins function during programmed cell death, the fact that calmyrin is a calcium-binding protein (Naik et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	426	, 1997) raises some obvious possibilities.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	427	 First, calmyrin may "sense" Ca2+ changes and subsequently regulate PS2 function.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	428	 Alternatively, PS2 proteins (including FAD mutants) may alter calcium homeostasis resulting in a change in calcium binding by calmyrin which could then trigger a signal transduction cascade.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	429	 This latter possibility is attractive since overexpression of presenilins has been shown to cause perturbations in calcium homeostasis (Guo et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	430	 Interestingly, the apoptosis rescue screen in which the PS2 ALG3 fragment was isolated (see introduction) yielded another cDNA named ALG2, which caused antisense inhibition of a calcium-binding protein (Vito et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	431	 However, when ALG2 was expressed in the sense orientation, this calcium-binding protein induced apoptosis (Lacana et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	432	 It could be argued that coexpression of any calcium-binding protein with presenilins would cause increased cell death.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	433	 This is clearly not the case as overexpression of another calcium-binding protein, calbindin D28k, suppressed the proapoptotic functions of PS (Guo et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	434	 An imbalance in calcium regulation could be catastrophic to the cell due to the central role calcium plays in cellular processes including its participation in the induction phase of apoptosis (reviewed by McConkey and Orrenius, 1997).
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	435	Although there is some disagreement as to whether AD involves a perturbation of calcium regulation (see Etcheberrigaray et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	436	, 1998), the consensus of research (opinion) is indicative of such a defect.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	437	 The uncertainty is in part complicated by lack of reliable and easy methods to measure intracellular calcium, let alone compare them in different individuals.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	438	 Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that calcium levels are altered in cells cultured from AD patients, especially those harboring (or transfected with) presenilin genes containing FAD-linked mutations (Ito et al.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	439	In summary, our results suggest that calmyrin, a calcium-binding myristoylated protein, may play dynamic and diverse roles in intracellular signaling, and we propose that it is important in the modulation of presenilin function.
0.47759822.10366599.html.plaintext.txt	440	 Understanding the complex interplay between calcium regulation, apoptotic signaling, and protein-protein interactions will no doubt aid in deciphering the mechanisms through which the presenilins function which in turn could provide insight into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	5	Mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 account for the majority of cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The presenilins have been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, but which of the multiple hydrophobic segments of the polypeptide chain span the lipid bilayer is unclear.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To address this question, we have constructed a series of chimeric molecules in which a topologically neutral reporter protein (a C-terminal fragment of prolactin) containing three artificial glycosylation sites is fused to presenilin 1 following each of the 10 potential transmembrane domains identified in hydrophobicity plots.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We have expressed these chimeras by translation in reticulocyte lysate containing canine pancreatic microsomes and by synthesis in transfected COS cells.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Based on utilization of the glycosylation sites and sensitivity of the reporter to protease digestion, we provide evidence that presenilin 1 has six transmembrane segments with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This model provides important clues to the potential functions of different parts of the presenilin molecule and how these might relate to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	11	Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by dementia, neuronal loss, and accumulation in the brain of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (1).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Familial forms of AD have been linked to mutations in three different genes, encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosomes 21, 14, and 1, respectively (2-5).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Over 50% of the cases of early-onset familial AD are attributable to mutations in the presenilin genes.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The mutations that have been described include over 35 different amino acid substitutions, as well as an in-frame deletion of exon 9 (reviewed in Ref.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	15	PS1 and PS2 are polypeptides of 467 and 448 amino acids, respectively, that have multiple hydrophobic segments (2, 4, 5).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These proteins are expressed in a number of tissues in addition to brain and are encoded by several alternatively spliced mRNAs (4, 7, 8).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The presenilins exhibit significant homology to a protein from Caenorhabditis elegans called SEL-12, which, based on genetic evidence, modulates signaling by the LIN-12/Notch pathway (9).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	18	 They show weaker homology to SPE-4, a membrane protein of C.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Immunofluorescence localization studies of transfected cells indicate that the protein is present at steady-state primarily in the ER, and perhaps in the Golgi also, but probably not on the plasma membrane (11).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In a neuronal cell line, PS1 expressed using a viral vector is localized to the cell body and dendrites (12).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Recent evidence indicates that PS1 is proteolytically cleaved between amino acids 260 and 320 in transfected cells as well as in brain tissue, although the significance of this cleavage is unclear (13).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	22	 There are reports that recombinant forms of PS2 can positively regulate apoptosis in lymphocytes and PC12 cells, but whether the endogenous protein normally functions in this way is unclear (14, 15).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Taken together, none of the available evidence clearly identifies the physiological role of the presenilins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, analysis of patient fibroblasts, transfected cells, and transgenic mice that co-express PS1 and APP indicate that pathogenic mutations in the presenilin protein enhance production of the amyloidgenic A42 fragment by 1.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	25	Determination of the membrane topology of the presenilins, in other words defining which parts of the polypeptide chain traverse the lipid bilayer, is of enormous importance in understanding the function of these proteins and their role in AD.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	26	 There are several reasons for this.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	27	 First, knowing which domains of the polypeptide lie in the cytoplasm and which in the lumen of the ER or Golgi will dictate hypotheses about the function of these domains.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Second, experimental attempts to identify cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the presenilins using screening procedures such as the yeast two-hybrid system or interaction cloning require a knowledge of which segments of the polypeptide chain lie in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Third, the membrane topology of the presenilins can be correlated with the positions of pathogenic mutations, providing clues to how these mutations alter the function of the proteins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Finally, knowledge of the membrane topology of the presenilins will allow a more detailed comparison with possible homologues than is possible simply on the basis of hydrophobicity plots.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	31	We report here our analysis of the membrane topology of PS1 using both in vitro and in vivo expression systems.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Our results suggest that the protein spans the membrane six times, with both N and C termini located in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This model stands in marked contrast to ones originally proposed on the basis of hydrophobicity plots that hypothesized either seven or nine transmembrane domains for PS1 and PS2 (2, 4, 5, 20).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Our conclusions are consistent with and significantly extend those of a recent report, suggesting that PS1 possesses either six or eight transmembrane segments (21), but they differ from those of a second study proposing an eight-transmembrane topology for the presenilin homologue SEL-12 (22).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	35	The PS1 segments of HR-PRL chimeras were generated by PCR, using as a template a PS1 cDNA derived from the RNA splice variant lacking exon 4 (which encodes the sequence VSRQ) (provided by Dr.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The 5 primer was GATCAGGAATTCATGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCG.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The 3 primer consisted of the sequence GACTAGGGTAACCAA followed by the complement of the sequence encoding the following amino acids: 122-128 for HR1-PRL, 151-157 for HR2-PRL, 181-187 for HR3-PRL, 209-215 for HR4-PRL, 233-239 for HR5-PRL, 271-277 for HR6-PRL, 370-376 for HR7-PRL, 397-403 for HR8-PRL, 423-429 for HR9-PRL, and 457-463 for HR10-PRL.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The reporter segment of the chimeras was generated by amplification of the 148 C-terminal amino acids of bovine prolactin, using as a template pBP292 (American Type Culture Collection).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The 5 primer was GATCAGGAATTCGATCTTGGTTACCATGGCCCTCAACAGCTGCCAT.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The 3 primer, which encoded three consensus sites for N-glycosylation and an HA tag, had the sequence: CTGCTATCTAGACTATGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATAGTTCCGTTCATGGATCCGTTAGTGCAGTTGTTGTTGTAGATGAT.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The PS1 fragments were digested with EcoRI and BstEII, and the reporter fragment with BstEII and XbaI.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The fragments were ligated into EcoRI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Samples were heated at 60  degrees C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE, since boiling results in aggregation of PS1 proteins (23).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	58	COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% C02, 95% air.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We have constructed chimeras in which a prolactin reporter is fused after each of these hydrophobic regions (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The reporter is a C-terminal fragment of bovine prolactin (residues 82-229) onto which we have appended three consensus sites for N-glycosylation, as well as an HA tag so that the proteins can be recognized by anti-HA as well as anti-prolactin antibodies.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	73	 A number of studies have utilized this portion of prolactin as a reporter, since it lacks any signals that might influence the membrane orientation of the adjacent polypeptide (24-26).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	74	 When the fusion proteins are synthesized on membrane-attached ribosomes, the reporter will be glycosylated and protected from proteases applied from the cytoplasmic surface only if it resides in the lumen of the ER, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The two techniques we have combined here, tagging a protein with artificial glycosylation sites and fusing it to a reporter molecule that can be recognized by antibody binding or enzymatic activity, have been used individually to map the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27, 28).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	76	 We recognize that although these techniques can provide evidence in support of a specific model of membrane topology, it is always possible that experimental modifications of the polypeptide chain may perturb its interaction with the lipid bilayer.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In the absence of canine pancreatic microsomes, proteins ranging in size from 33 to 70 kDa were recovered after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, corresponding to the unglycosylated fusion proteins (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	89	 When translation was performed in the presence of microsomes, HR1-PRL, HR3-PRL, and HR5-PRL (but not the other constructs) yielded additional products of slightly higher molecular weight (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	90	 These larger products represent glycosylated forms of the proteins, since they are eliminated when samples are treated with N-glycosidase F (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	91	 As has been observed by others (25, 26), glycosylation in the in vitro system is inefficient, resulting in the presence of some unglycosylated protein even when translation is performed with microsomes (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	92	 We noted that PS1-PRL fusion proteins often migrated as closely spaced doublets on SDS-PAGE (see Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	93	 2B, lanes 1 and 2); this phenomenon has been observed for full-length PS1 synthesized both in vitro and in transfected cells and is likely to result from an uncharacterized posttranslational modification (11, 12, 29).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The protected fragment could be immunoprecipitated with anti-prolactin as well as anti-HA antibodies, but not with an antibody against the N terminus of PS1 (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	113	 3, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that the N terminus is protease-accessible and is therefore cytoplasmic.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Based on the 7-kDa reduction in molecular size, we infer that proteinase K removes approximately 70 amino acids from the N terminus of HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL (up to a point near the beginning of HR1), but that the cytoplasmic loops between the transmembrane hydrophobic segments are resistant to cleavage, probably because they are short ( < 10 amino acids) and therefore closely apposed to the lipid bilayer (25).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	120	 We again observed that only HR1-, HR3-, and HR5-PRL were glycosylated, as indicated by a reduction in the molecular weight of these proteins upon treatment with N-glycosidase F (Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In contrast to the situation in reticulocyte lysate, glycosylation of these chimeras in COS cells was essentially quantitative, making it unlikely that the proteins are heterogeneous with respect to localization of the reporter.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Each of these three fusion proteins also produces a protected fragment that is ~7 kDa smaller than the intact protein following proteinase K digestion of a postnuclear supernatant derived from the transfected cells (Fig.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	133	Taken together, the results of glycosylation site utilization and protease protection both in vitro and in cells suggest the model of PS1 topology shown in Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	134	 HR1, HR3, and HR5 span the membrane from the cytoplasmic to the lumenal side and HR2, HR4, and HR6 from the lumenal to the cytoplasmic side.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Both the N and C termini are cytoplasmic.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	136	 HR7-HR10 do not constitute transmembrane domains, although our analysis does not address the issue of whether these segments associate closely with the lipid bilayer in the manner of "reentrant loops" described for some channel proteins (25, 27, 30).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This model places the two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (asparagine residues 275 and 401) in the cytoplasm, consistent with the fact that full-length PS1 expressed in cells or by in vitro translation is not glycosylated (12, 23, 29).
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Given the high degree of homology between PS1 and PS2, we would predict that PS2 has the same membrane topology shown in Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Although our data support a six-transmembrane domain structure for PS1, it is of course possible that the membrane topology of the native protein is different from the one we have inferred here based on the properties of PS1-prolactin fusions.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	140	 However, the fusion of a reporter segment or the introduction of ectopic glycosylation sites has not been found to disturb the topology of a number of other membrane proteins (27, 28).

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Although our data indicate that HR7-HR10 do not span the membrane, one or more of these hydrophobic segments may associate closely with the lipid bilayer.

0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	144	Our results are consistent with those of Doan et al.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	145	 (21) who concluded that PS1 has either six or eight transmembrane domains (their data did not distinguish between the two possibilities), with the N terminus, C terminus, and part of the "loop" region between residues 320 and 390 in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	146	 However, our results differ from those of Li and Greenwald (22) who proposed a model for the C.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	147	 elegans PS1 homologue SEL-12 having eight transmembrane segments, including HR1-HR6, HR-8, and HR-9.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	148	 We think it unlikely on theoretical grounds that HR8 of PS1 spans the membrane, since it is short (16 amino acids) and is only marginally hydrophobic (see Fig.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	149	 The identification of HR8 and HR9 as transmembrane segments in SEL-12 was inferred indirectly from the enzymatic activity of a pair of -galactosidase fusions in which HR8 was deleted, and it is possible that this deletion modified the membrane topology of the protein or altered the activity of the galactosidase reporter.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	150	 It is also conceivable that the membrane topologies of PS1 and SEL-12 are different.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	151	Our model for the topology of PS1 has important implications for the function of the protein and its role in AD.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	152	 We find that most of the polypeptide chain of PS1 is cytoplasmic, including the N-terminal region and a long C-terminal tail encompassing HR7-HR10.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	153	 These segments may therefore be important in interactions with cytoplasmic proteins.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Much of the cytoplasmic region from HR6 to the C terminus, exclusive of the segment between HR7 and HR8, is highly conserved in the presenilins and SEL-12, suggesting essential functions for this domain.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	155	 A number of pathogenic mutations are found between the end of HR6 and the end of HR7 (reviewed in Ref.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	156	 6), and one might speculate that these alter associations of PS1 with molecules in the cytoplasm.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Since little of the polypeptide chain protrudes into the ER lumen, a direct interaction between PS1 and lumenal proteins seems unlikely, although associations with other ER membrane proteins are possible.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	158	 If PS1 binds to APP, a possibility suggested by enhanced production of the A 42 fragment in cells expressing mutant PS1 (16-19), this interaction would most likely occur transiently during transit of APP through the ER and Golgi and would probably involve either the transmembrane region or short cytoplasmic tail of APP.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	159	The topology model proposed here makes it unlikely that PS1 functions as a conventional G-protein-coupled receptor, but is consistent with a role for PS1 in processes such as vesicle docking and budding, membrane-cytoskeletal interactions, or ion and solute transport.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The recently described endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (13), which is predicted to occur following HR6, would be expected to generate a C-terminal fragment that lacks any transmembrane segments.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Whether this fragment is soluble would depend on how tightly HR7-HR10 are associated with the lipid bilayer, but if it were diffusible it could serve to transmit a signal to other regions of the cell.
0.34432584.9115271.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Knowing the membrane topology of PS1 will now facilitate attempts to isolate interacting molecules and will provide a starting point for further investigations of the biological activity of normal and mutant forms of the protein.

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	4	Missense mutations in the presenilin 2 (PS-2) gene on chromosome 1 were sought by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the open reading frame of 60 pedigrees with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In the majority of these pedigrees, PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) gene mutations had been excluded.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While no additional PS-2 pathogenic mutations were detected, four silent nucleotide substitutions and alternative splicing of nucleotides 1338-1340 (Glu325) were observed.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Analysis of additional members of a pedigree known to segregate a Met239Val mutation in PS-2 revealed that the age of onset of symptoms is highly variable (range 45-88 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This variability is not attributable to differences in ApoE genotypes.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These results suggest (i) that, in contrast to mutations in PS-1, mutations in PS-2 are a relatively rare cause of FAD; (ii) that other genetic or environmental factors modify the AD phenotype associated with PS-2 mutations; and (iii) that still other FAD susceptibility genes remain to be identified.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	10	Missense mutations associated with early onsetAlzheimer's disease (AD) have been discovered in two related genes termed presenilin I on chromosome 14 (1 ) and presenilin II on chromosome 1 (2 ,3 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Analysis of a number of large data sets have revealed that missense mutations in the presenilin I (PS-1) gene are a frequent cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), accounting for perhaps as much as 50% of all cases of early onset FAD (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In order to determine the frequency of mutations in the presenilin II (PS-2) gene, we undertook a survey for mutations in the open reading frame (ORF) of the PS-2 gene in 60 pedigrees with FAD.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The disease in these families was characterized by the occurrence of AD consistent with the NINDS-ADRDA criteria in at least three closely related subjects, often in more than one generation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In these pedigrees, the age at onset (range: 35-82 years; 36 with mean age at onset  < = 64 years; 14 with mean age at onset  > = 65 years; 10 with insufficient reliable data on age at onset) overlapped that observed in the pedigrees with known PS-2 mutations (onset between 45 and 72 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	15	 To determine the penetrance of PS-2 mutations, we also examined several additional members of the FLO10 pedigree previously described with the Met239Val missense mutation in the PS-2 gene (2 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Our data suggest that missense mutations in the PS-2 gene are a rare cause of AD and that these missense mutations may be subject to the modifying action of other genes or environmental influences.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	17	Fibroblasts, transformed lymphoblasts or peripheral blood samples were obtained from at least one affected member of 60 kindreds with multiple (>3) family members affected by FAD that were ascertained through the familial Alzheimer's disease registry at the University of Toronto, through clinics at the University of Florence and the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, from French University Hospitals through the National INSERM network of France, and from the Indiana University Alzheimer's Disease DNA Bank and the NIA sponsored repository at the Coriell Institute.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Diagnosis of AD in affected members used the NINDS-ADRDA criteria or the similar CERAD criteria.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Mutations in the PS-1 and [beta]-amyloid precursor protein ([beta]APP) genes had previously been excluded in the majority of these pedigrees by sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products corresponding to the PS-1 gene and genomic PCR products corresponding to exons 16 and 17 of [beta]APP.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	20	Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of RT-PCR products corresponding to the ORF of PS-2 in these 60 FAD pedigrees failed to uncover any additional mutations beyond the two initial mutations (Asn141Ile mutation in three related kindreds of Volga-German origin, and the Met239Val mutation in the FLO10 pedigree of Italian origin) previously reported in this data set (2 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Specific screening just for the Asn141Ile and Met239Val mutations in a supplemental set of genomic DNA samples from affected probands of 81 Swedish FAD pedigrees also failed to identify further instances of either mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	22	 However, although no pathogenic nucleotide sequence differences were observed, four `silent' nucleotide substitutions were detected (T - >  C at 626 bp/codon 23; C - >  T at 806 bp/codon 147; C - >  T at 1571 bp/codon 402; and G - >  A at 1670 bp/codon 435-sequence numbering from Accession no.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	23	 All of these substitutions occurred at the third nucleotide position of a codon, and would therefore be predicted not to cause a change in the amino acid sequence.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	24	 A fifth sequence variant-the variable presence of nucleotides 1338-1340 encoding the Glu325 residuewas found in transcripts from most tissues.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Transcripts with and without nucleotides 1338-1340, which reflects the use of an alternate splice donor sequence, were of approximately equal abundance in brain, fibroblasts and leukocytes.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	26	During the investigation of the PS-2 gene in several newly ascertained members of the FLO10 pedigree segregating the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, we identified an additional carrier of this mutation (subject III-20 in Table 1 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Surprisingly, this subject was aged 87 years and had had no evidence for cognitive or memory impairment on serial follow-up over several years until age 84 years when she was noted to become mildly demented, and is now profoundly demented (Mini Mental Status Examination score 4/30) with clinical features that sustain a diagnosis of probable AD by the NINDS-ADRDA criteria.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A review of clinical data on additional members of the extended pedigree also uncovered two other subjects in the direct lineage of the family who had either historical evidence for late onset AD (subject I-2, the affected grandfather of III-20 who died at 75 years with dementia) or who currently have clinical features consistent with probable AD using the NINDS-ADRDA criteria (subject III-39 onset at 88 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	29	 We and others have previously reported that the genotype at the Apolipoprotein E gene can modulate the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with the Val717Ile mutation in [beta]APP (7 ,8 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, in the FLO10 family with the Met239Val mutation in PS-2, ApoE genotypes do not correlate with age of onset (Table 1 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Thus, the very elderly symptomatic subject III-20 (onset 84 years) has the same ApoE genotype ([epsilon]3/[epsilon]3) as three other affected carriers of the Met239Val mutation, all of whom developed symptoms at a younger age (onset 45-72 years).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Moreover, the affected carrier IV-21, with the ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]4 developed symptoms at an age (48 years) similar to that of his affected sibling IV-18 with an ApoE genotype of [epsilon]3/[epsilon]3 (onset = 45 years) (Table 1 , Fig.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our sample size is too small to draw reliable conclusions about the presence or absence of interactions between the ApoE genotype and the Asn141Ile mutation (Table 1 ).

0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	38	 With the exception of subject III-39, whose genotypes at PS-2 and ApoE are unknown because no biological samples are available, all affected subjects carried the PS-2 Met239Val mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	39	Although the large cadre of FAD pedigrees reported here does not represent an unbiased survey, the paucity of missense mutations in the PS-2 gene amongst FAD pedigrees in our data set suggests that, in contrast to mutations in the ORF of PS-1, mutations in the ORF of this gene are a rare cause of FAD, at least in Caucasian populations.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We can confidently exclude mutations in intronic sequences associated with RNA splice sites [indeed only one such mutation which affects splicing of exon 10 of PS-1 has been found in FAD affected subjects (T.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, until the 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences have been searched for pathogenic mutations, we cannot exclude the formal possibility that mutations might exist in these sequences in some of our pedigrees.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Nevertheless, there are two corollaries to the conclusion that PS-2 ORF mutations are rare.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	43	 First, unless a phenotype uniquely associated with or at least enriched in subjects with PS-2 mutants can be found, screening programs for mutations in the ORF of PS-2 are likely to have a low yield.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Second, and more importantly, other as yet unidentified FAD susceptibility loci must exist.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	45	Table 1 Age of onset relative to the genotypes at the ApoE and PS-2 genes Subject.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	46	The age of symptom onset or current age of PS-2 mutation carriers are displayed along with each subject's ApoE genotype.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	47	The other conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutations is generally older (45-88 years) than that observed for most PS-1 mutations (25-65 years), and is highly variable even amongst affected members of the same pedigree.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This contrasts sharply with the experience with PS-1 mutations, where the age of onset is generally quite similar amongst affected members of the same family, and often amongst members of different families with the same mutation (1 ,2 ,4 -6 ).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because to date all subjects with AD in the FLO10 pedigree have inherited the Met239Val mutation, it is unlikely that the late onset cases represent phenocopies and/or that it represents a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with a nearby pathogenic mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation is that there is a single cause of the disease (the Met239Val mutation) and that the phenotype is modified by other genetic or environmental factors.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The limited number of subjects with the Asn141Ile mutation in our data set prevents rigorous conclusions about any interactions between the ApoE genotype and this mutation.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, analysis of a larger data set by T.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Schellenberg also reveals no obvious interaction between the genotypes at ApoE and PS-2 Asn141Ile (manuscript in preparation).
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This absence of a close correlation between the ApoE genotype and age of symptom onset in subjects with PS-2 mutation has two implications.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	55	 First, in view of parallel observations showing no apparent interaction between ApoE genotype and mutations in PS-1 (7 ,9 ,10 ), together with the structural and amino acid sequence similarities of the PS-1 and PS-2 proteins (1 -3 ), it is likely that the functional effect of PS-1 and PS-2 mutations are similar and are either remote from the functional effect of the ApoE [epsilon]4 allele, or affect a biochemical pathway leading to AD which is different from that influenced by ApoE [epsilon]4.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Second, the variation in age of onset in PS-2 mutation carriers argues that other modifying environmental or genetic factors (e.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	57	 other polymorphisms within the presenilin genes or differences in other genes) must exist.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The nature of these other factors remains to be determined.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	59	 However, if these modifying factors can be identified, they might be exploitable as a therapeutic tool.
0.62542415.8817335.html.plaintext.txt	60	Subjects with familially clustered Alzheimer's disease (as defined by the occurrence of at least three first or second degree relatives with AD) were recruited from patients referred for the investigation of dementia at the University of Toronto, University of Florence, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre, the Huddinge Hospital of the Karolinska Institute, and French University Hospitals.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	5	Mutations in the highly homologous presenilin genes encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2) are linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, apart from a role in early development, neither the normal function of the presenilins nor the mechanisms by which mutant proteins cause AD are well understood.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We describe here the properties of a novel human interactor of the presenilins named ubiquilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo, together with coimmunoprecipitation and cell fractionation studies, provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin interacts with both PS1 and PS2.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Ubiquilin is noteworthy since it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, we show that ubiquilin promotes presenilin protein accumulation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Pulse-labeling experiments indicate that ubiquilin facilitates increased presenilin synthesis without substantially changing presenilin protein half-life.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The topology of presenilins is debatable, though the most widely drawn models show proteins that weave through the membrane eight times, with the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and a large "loop" between transmembrane domains six and seven all oriented towards the cytoplasm (see Fig 1 A) (Haass and De Strooper 1999 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Although both proteins share extensive sequence identity along their entire lengths, their NH2-terminal domains and the second half of their loops are highly divergent, suggesting that these unique regions could modulate different functions of the two presenilins.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	183	Identification of Human Ubiquilin, a Novel Interactor of the Presenilin Proteins A novel human protein, which we named ubiquilin, for a protein with ubiquitin-related protein domains that interacts with the presenilins, was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) for proteins that interact with the PS2 COOH-terminal sequence (Fig 1a and Fig b).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Two overlapping clones encoding the COOH-terminal 203 and 218 residues of ubiquilin were isolated in the screen.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	185	 To clone the entire ubiquilin ORF, 5' RACE was performed.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	186	 This yielded 1,053 bps of additional upstream sequence, including an in-frame methionine codon located at the beginning of a ubiquitin-like (UB) domain.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Conceptual translation from this methionine predicted a 559-amino acid protein.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	188	 However, this methionine was unlikely to be the authentic start codon since translation from it produced a protein that was noticeably smaller, as seen by SDS-PAGE, than endogenous ubiquilin detected using pAb raised to the COOH-terminal 218 residues of ubiquilin (data not shown).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Subsequent EST database searches and sequencing of putative overlapping clones yielded a clone with a longer 5' end, which included an upstream in-frame methionine codon (corresponding to a 595-amino acid protein).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Several lines of evidence indicate that this methionine codon was the authentic start methionine of ubiquilin.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	214	 A partial ubiquilin clone (encoding the COOH-terminal 218 residues), isolated from the Y2H screen, and a near full-length clone (encoding residues 37 to 595) both bound to the PS2-COOH-terminal bait >55-fold compared with negative-control baits (Fig 1C and Fig D, respectively).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	215	 However, the longer ubiquilin clone interacted less strongly with the PS1 to COOH-terminal bait.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	216	 This interaction nevertheless was still >12-fold compared with the negative-control baits (Fig 1 D).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	217	 We also tested whether ubiquilin would interact with portions of the loop regions of the presenilins (Fig 1a and Fig b) that we had used in another Y2H study (Stabler et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Interestingly, the near full-length ubiquilin construct also interacted well with both PS2 and PS1 loop sequences, and, surprisingly, the interaction was approximately twice as strong as with the PS2 to COOH-terminal bait (Fig 1 D).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	219	 This suggested that two separate regions within the presenilin proteins could interact with ubiquilin.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	255	 The high overall homology of the proteins suggests that they belong to the same multigene family.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	265	 Differences in the divergent regions are instructive, especially the insert between residues L485 to T527 in Chap1, which is conserved in PLIC-2 but missing in ubiquilin, PLIC-1, and XDRP1.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	266	 Based on the homology between human and mouse sequences, it appears that ubiquilin is more closely related to PLIC-1, whereas Chap1 is more closely related to PLIC-2.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Collectively, the proteins are likely to be members of a related multigene family, since at least two independent genes are known to exist in humans, mice, and A.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Equivalent amounts of the fractions were then immunoblotted to determine the amount of ubiquilin protein in the two fractions.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	294	 In untransfected cells, almost all of the ubiquilin protein was present in the soluble fraction, independent of detergent treatment (Fig 5 D, lanes S- and S+).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This is consistent with the predicted hydrophilic nature of ubiquilin protein.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	296	 However, in PS2-transfected cells, 30% more ubiquilin protein separated with the pellet fraction in the absence of detergent treatment (Fig 5 F, lane P).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	297	 This change in solubility is likely a consequence of ubiquilin binding to overexpressed membrane-bound PS2, which also fractionated in the insoluble membrane-containing pellet fraction (Fig 5 E, lane P-).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	298	 As expected for integral membrane proteins, Triton X-100 treatment caused the release of PS2 into the soluble fraction (Fig 5 E, lane S+), which coincided with ubiquilin once again separating completely in the soluble fraction (Fig 5 F, lane S+).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Although one antiserum reacted with an unknown protein of 55 kD (Fig 3 E), this reactivity was subsequently removed by affinity purification of the antibody (Fig 3 F).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	302	 Immunofluorescence staining of ubiquilin within cells was performed with the specific anti-ubiquilin antibodies.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Compared with the preimmune sera (Fig 6A and Fig D), both antibodies revealed similar staining patterns (Fig 6B and Fig E).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Indirect immunofluorescence, as well as laser confocal microscopy, revealed endogenous intracellular localization of ubiquilin in HeLa cells to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig 6B, Fig E, and Fig G).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	305	 In some cells, endogenous ubiquilin staining was stronger in the nucleus (Fig 6 E, arrowheads).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Furthermore, in a small subset of cells, ubiquilin within the cytoplasm was localized to punctate structures (Fig 6B and Fig E, arrows).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	307	 The frequency of these structures dramatically increased upon overexpression of full-length untagged ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	308	 To corroborate the anti-ubiquilin staining pattern, we performed additional localization studies on myc- and GFP-tagged ubiquilin proteins in HeLa cells (Fig 2 IV, O and N, respectively).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Overexpressed myc-tagged ubiquilin stained with anti-myc mAb exhibited the same intracellular structures (Fig 6 I) as overexpressed wild-type ubiquilin (Fig 6C and Fig F).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Since the GFP-ubiquilin image in Fig 6 H was captured from live and unfixed cells without antibodies, this established that the anti-ubiquilin structures seen previously were not artifacts of the paraformaldehyde fixation or immunofluorescence staining procedures.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	326	 Indeed, there was a dramatic change in ubiquilin staining in HeLa cells coexpressing either PS1 or PS2 and ubiquilin, resulting in almost complete colocalization of the presenilin and ubiquilin intracellular staining patterns, as seen by laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig 7A and Fig B).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	327	 Careful examination of the colocalized proteins revealed ubiquilin staining to be punctate, whereas presenilin staining could be traced to an ER-like pattern.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	334	Since Y2H data suggested that ubiquilin interacts with both the loop and COOH-terminal domains of the presenilins, we examined whether removal of these regions from PS2 would abolish colocalization of the proteins in vivo.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	335	 To assess this possibility, two PS2 constructs containing progressively longer COOH-terminal deletions were made.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	336	 In the first, PS2(C), the 39-amino acid COOH-terminal domain was deleted (Fig 1 A, arrowhead), whereas in the second, PS2(LC), the large hydrophilic loop and all sequences downstream were deleted (Fig 1 A, arrow).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	337	 When expressed in HeLa cells, PS2(C) still colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 C), presumably since the PS2 loop region that remained could bind ubiquilin, as suggested by the strong interaction between the two in Y2H assays (Fig 1 D).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	338	 However, once the hydrophilic loop region and COOH terminus were both removed, PS2(LC) no longer colocalized with ubiquilin (Fig 7 D), suggesting that the NH2 terminus and the first six transmembrane domains of PS2 do not contain additional ubiquilin binding sites.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	339	 A notable feature of the overexpression of PS2(LC) was its accumulation into large spherical aggregates that failed to stain positively for ubiquilin.

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	342	 However, these conditions did not markedly increase PS2 protein levels (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	343	 Remarkably, coexpression of ubiquilin with PS2 caused a substantial (>10-fold) increase in PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 B, lanes 7 to 9) compared with overexpression of PS2 alone (Fig 8 B, lanes 4 to 6).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	344	 This effect was independent of treatment with lactacystin or MG-132, as it also occurred just as robustly in cells not treated with the proteasome inhibitors.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	345	 Particularly striking was the increased accumulation in SDS-PAGE gels of full-length uncleaved PS2 protein (Fig 8 B, arrowhead) and higher molecular weight complexes that PS2 forms.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	346	 Increasing the amount of transfected ubiquilin plasmid DNA, whereas maintaining constant levels of transfected PS2 plasmid DNA, revealed a dose-dependent effect by ubiquilin on PS2 accumulation within the cells (Fig 8 E, lanes 1 to 5).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	347	 This effect was specific for ubiquilin expression, since cotransfection of increasing amounts of GFP plasmid DNA with PS2 did not increase PS2 protein accumulation (Fig 8 F, lanes 1 to 5).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	350	 In fact, recent reports have indicated that cleavage of presenilins is not essential for biological function of the presenilins, namely by its ability to rescue PS activity in C.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	351	 The absence of detectable endoproteolytic cleaved forms of PS2 is more clearly illustrated in Fig 8 G, which shows that an antibody specific for PS2-loop sequences downstream of the proposed endoproteolytic cleavage site recognized the same 54 kD and higher PS2 species (as the PS2 NH2-terminal specific antibody).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	352	 Interestingly, though ubiquilin caused a dose-dependent increase in presenilin accumulation, it did not alter the accumulation levels of various other endogenous HeLa proteins, such as lamin B, calreticulin, calnexin, BiP, and -tubulin (Fig 8 H).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	353	 Similar experiments repeated with PS1 indicated that ubiquilin also promoted a dose-dependent increase in PS1 protein accumulation in HeLa cells (data not shown).

0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	418	Here, we describe a novel human presenilin-interacting protein named ubiquilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	419	 Y2H interaction, GST pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation studies, changes in the cellular fractionation of proteins, and colocalization of the proteins expressed in vivo provide compelling evidence that ubiquilin and the presenilins interact with one another.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	420	 Ubiquilin is an important protein because it contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains typically thought to be involved in targeting proteins for degradation, yet ubiquilin promotes increased presenilin protein accumulation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	421	 Moreover, ubiquilin is highly expressed in neurons of human brain and is associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies of AD and PD brains, respectively.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	422	The promotion of presenilin protein accumulation by ubiquilin overexpression is noteworthy as a new means by which presenilin levels may be modulated.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	423	 By conducting pulse-chase experiments, we found that ubiquilin induced an increase in presenilin protein maturation, but did not dramatically affect presenilin protein turnover.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	424	 The net effect over time from increased presenilin protein synthesis and undisturbed turnover rate would eventually lead to an elevation of the intracellular pool of presenilin proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	425	 This modulation of presenilin levels by ubiquilin may have important consequences to cellular functions, as presenilins have been linked to various biological processes, including Notch signaling, calcium regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, unfolded-protein response, as well as APP-associated gamma secretase activity (see Introduction).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	426	It will be interesting to determine the precise mechanism by which ubiquilin induces increased presenilin protein synthesis.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	427	 Ubiquilin could increase presenilin synthesis by simply increasing presenilin transcription, increasing presenilin translation, or facilitating correct polypeptide folding, maturation, and intracellular targeting of the polytopic transmembrane presenilin protein.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	428	 Based on its various properties, we are especially intrigued by the possibility that ubiquilin may act as a molecular chaperone.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	429	 (a) Studies of the Xenopus ubiquilin homologue, XDRP1, have suggested that ubiquilin can act posttranscriptionally like a molecular chaperone and prevent degradation of in vitro translated cyclin A protein (Funakoshi et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	430	 (b) Chap1 (ubiquilin 2) has been shown to bind Stch, an Hsp70-like protein (Kaye et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	431	 In turn, many heat-shock proteins have been shown to function as molecular chaperones, preventing protein aggregation and protein degradation (Warrick et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	432	 1999 ; Krobitsch and Lindquist 2000 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	433	 (c) Recent evidence has linked ubiquilin proteins to the proteasome (Kleijnen et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	434	 Meanwhile, the 19S regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome (the degradation complex for ubiquitin-tagged proteins) has been shown to possess protein-unfolding activity (Braun et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	435	 (d) Indirect evidence that ubiquilin may aid in presenilin protein folding or targeting comes from our observation that the presenilin construct PS2(LC), with deletions of both the loop and COOH-terminal ubiquilin-interaction sites (as demonstrated by Y2H assays and lack of colocalization with ubiquilin within cells), frequently accumulated into large cytoplasmic aggregates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	436	 In contrast, presenilin molecules, which contained ubiquilin interaction sites, rarely formed large protein aggregates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	437	 The connection between aggregate accumulation and loss of ubiquilin interaction may be entirely coincidental.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	438	 However, the possibility that the two are interconnected cannot be discounted.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	439	 Finally, presenilins proteins have themselves been linked to molecular chaperones of the ER, which are involved in the unfolded-protein response (Katayama et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	440	Another mechanism by which ubiquilin might increase presenilin accumulation is to alter presenilin degradation rates, especially that of the ubiquitinated forms of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	441	 In fact, a recent report by Kleijnen et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	442	 2000 found evidence that overexpression of human ubiquilin proteins, hPLIC-1 (ubiquilin 1) and hPLIC-2 (ubiquilin 2), interfered with ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 and IkB.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	443	 Although we did not find any significant change in the turnover rate of the major 54-kD PS2 polypeptide species (corresponding to full-length PS2), we cannot exclude the possibility that certain ubiquitinated forms of presenilins may have altered turnover rates.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	444	 The ubiquitinated forms of presenilins migrated as a smear on the SDS-PAGE gels, which made quantification of the turnover rates of these species difficult.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	445	 It will be important in future studies to determine if ubiquilin is involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	446	The region in ubiquilin that binds presenilins was mapped to the COOH-terminal region containing the UBA domain, which is highly conserved in ubiquilin family members from human to yeast (Fig 4).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	447	 This sequence was both necessary and sufficient to bind PS1 and PS2 in vitro.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	448	 The UBA domain is a recently recognized motif present in one or two copies in a variety of proteins involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome folding/degradation pathway, UV excision repair, and phosphorylation (Hofmann and Bucher 1996 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	449	 The UBA domain consists of 55 total residues of which 45 appear to be core residues.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	450	 15 of the core residues are extremely well conserved, suggesting they may be important for determining the overall structure of the domain.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	451	 Through nuclear magnetic resonance, the structure of the COOH-terminal UBA domain of the human DNA repair protein HHR23A (RAD23 homologue) has been determined.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	452	 It is a compact three-helix bundle with an exposed hydrophobic surface predicted to be involved in protein to protein interactions (Dieckmann et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	453	 The strong binding of the ubiquilin UBA domain to presenilins may be facilitated by similar protein to protein interactions.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	454	 It will be important to determine if sequence variation of the UBA domain in different proteins influences binding specificity to different target proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	455	In vitro binding assays indicated that the UB domain in the NH2-terminal portion of ubiquilin was not required for binding presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	456	 Although this domain shares high homology to the conserved 76-amino acid ubiquitin polypeptide, it is unlikely to be involved in covalent linkage to lysine residues of target proteins, since it lacks the obligate COOH-terminal glycine residue required for cleavage and conjugation.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	457	 Another possibility could be that the UB domain is modified by conjugation by either ubiquitin or other small ubiquitin-like proteins (e.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	458	) to its lysine group (or groups) forming ubiquitin-conjugates (Pickart 1998 ).
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	459	 This is also unlikely to occur, as ubiquilin immunoblots did not show the expected ladder of ubiquitin-conjugated bands.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	460	 Therefore, the UB domain may play a role in some other function.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	461	 For example, in yeast RAD23 and its human homologues (HHR23A and HHR23B), the UB domains are involved in binding subunits of the proteasome, whereas in XDRP1, the UB domain is necessary for binding cyclin A.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	462	 Clearly, insight into ubiquilin's function will emerge from an understanding of protein to protein interactions and the roles of its different domains.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	463	Using a combination of immunological and GFP-tagging approaches, we have demonstrated that ubiquilin is localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in HeLa cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	464	 The intensity of nuclear staining was variable, with some nuclei staining very brightly.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	465	 The variability may be related to cell cycle changes of cyclin A (a protein to which ubiquilin's homologue XDRP1 has been shown to interact) levels within the nucleus.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	466	 The cytoplasmic distribution of ubiquilin was also variable.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	467	 In untransfected cells, endogenous ubiquilin had a fine punctate appearance, with hints of association to a network-like pattern, possibly the ER.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	468	 In some of these cells, ubiquilin accumulated in larger spherical structures throughout the cytoplasm, whose number and size were variable.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	469	 Upon ubiquilin overexpression, the cells formed even larger and more numerous ubiquilin-containing structures.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	470	 Under confocal microscopy, the ubiquilin staining pattern colocalized almost perfectly with the presenilin staining pattern.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	471	 Considering that the two presenilin interaction sites (COOH terminus and loop domains) both face the cytoplasm according to the predicted topology of presenilins in membranes, it is not surprising that ubiquilin colocalized with ER membrane-bound presenilin.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	472	 Still, many other proteins have also been shown to interact with these two domains of presenilins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	473	 Clearly, understanding the dynamics of the different protein to protein interactions should provide clues regarding presenilin functions.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	474	 A study of mouse PLIC-1 and PLIC-2 suggested an involvement in linking integrins via integrin-associated proteins to the vimentin cytoskeleton (Wu et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	475	 We have not observed any significant staining of ubiquilin to the cell periphery and do not know if this is in any way related to the lack of expression of particular integrin-associated proteins or integrins in HeLa cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	476	 Nevertheless, it is interesting that vimentin and presenilins have been linked to one another in aggresomes, structures involved in the cellular response to misfolded proteins (Johnston et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	477	 Moreover, recent evidence indicates that aggresomes are involved in the recruitment of the proteasome Hsp70 and chaperones (Garcia-Mata et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	478	 1999 ), which circumstantially suggests a mechanism by which ubiquilin could be associated with proteins of the misfolded protein response.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	479	There are the several lines of evidence that link ubiquitin to genes and tissues involved in AD.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	480	 First, presenilin proteins are thought to be ubiquitinated, since treatment with proteasome inhibitors cause the accumulation of large complexes, which migrate in SDS gels in a manner consistent with modification by ubiquitin (Kim et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	481	 Second, it is well known that ubiquitin immunoreactivity is strongly associated with the NFTs and senile plaques of AD, hallmark lesions of AD pathology (Mori et al.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	482	 The strong ubiquilin immunoreactivity associated with NFTs and Lewy bodies is intriguing, considering that these lesions are known to contain misfolded proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	483	 At present, our results do not provide clues as to whether ubiquilin is acting in a causative role or as an end result of association with misfolded and accumulated proteins.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	484	 We plan to pursue this in the future.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	485	In summary, ubiquilin is the first presenilin-interacting protein, to our knowledge, that has been found to regulate presenilin levels in cells.
0.49919817.11076969.html.plaintext.txt	486	 The presence of multiple ubiquitin-related domains suggests ubiquilin may be involved in the regulation of presenilin protein levels by the proteasome-folding and/or degradation pathway.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Release of amyloid ss (Ass) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires cleavages by ss- and -secretases and plays a crucial role in Alzheimer s disease (AD) pathogenesis.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Missense mutations in the APP gene causing familial AD are clustered around the ss-, - and particular -secretase cleavage sites.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We systematically compare in primary neurons the effect on APP processing of a series of clinical APP mutations (two of which not characterized before) located in close proximity to the -secretase cleavage site.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We confirm and extend previous observations showing that all these mutations (T714I, V715M, V715A, I716V, V717I and V717L) affect -secretase cleavage causing an increased relative ratio of Ass42 to Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Taking advantage of these extended series of APP mutations we were able to demonstrate an inverse correlation between these ratios and the age at onset of the disease in the different families.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In addition, a subset of mutations caused the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments indicating that these mutations also influence the stability of APP C-terminal fragments.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, it is unlikely that these fragments contribute significantly to the disease process.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene were the first to be recognized to cause early-onset autosomal-dominant Alzheimer s disease (AD).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Since the initial report of a pathogenic APP mutation (1), 10 different APP mutations have been identified in a limited number of early-onset AD families (2 to 10; C.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	12	Van Broeckhoven, unpublished data).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	13	 All mutations cluster near the proteolytic cleavage sites in APP and were shown to affect the release of amyloidss (Ass) (6 to 8,11 to 18; C.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	14	Van Broeckhoven, unpublished data).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Release of Ass involves successive cleavages by ss-secretase (BACE) and -secretase.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	16	 BACE cleaves APP between residues 671 and 672 (codon numbering of the APP770 isoform) or between residues 681 and 682 (19), leading to the secretion of the APP ectodomain (sAPPss) in the extracellular medium and to the retention of a 12 kDa cell-bound C-terminal fragment (CTFss or C99).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Further cleavage of CTFss by -secretase, predominantly occurring between residues 711 and 712 (40-cleavage), and to a lesser extent between residues 713 and 714 (42-cleavage), results in the secretion of, respectively, a 40 and 42 amino acid Ass peptide (Ass40 and Ass42).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The remaining 55 to 57 residue long CTF (CTF or C55/57, or AID:APP intracellular domain), is rapidly degraded (P.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	19	De Stooper, manuscript submitted for publication) and is only present at extremely low levels in vitro (20,21) and in vivo (22).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The function of this fragment remains elusive.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Alternatively, APP can be cleaved within the Ass sequence by -secretase, leading to the secretion of the APP ectodomain (sAPP) and the retention of a 10 kDa CTF (CTF or C83).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Subsequent cleavage of CTF by -secretase leads to the production of a 3 kDa N-truncated amyloid peptide, named p3.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	23	Presenilin (PS) proteins are required in -secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, since deletion of the PS1 gene inhibits Ass generation (23).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Moreover, the finding that mutagenesis of critical aspartate residues (D257 and D385) in PS1 causes reduced Ass secretion and accumulation of APPCTFs led to the hypothesis that PS1 may exert an aspartyl protease activity and that it might be identical to -secretase (24).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition to most APP mutations, PS interferes with -secretase activity in such a way that production of the highly amyloidogenic Ass42 is increased (25).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Consequently, a leading hypothesis for AD etiology is  the amyloid cascade hypothesis  (26) stating that increased Ass42 secretion represents a gain of misfunction.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	27	However, it was reported recently that the APP V715M mutation affects Ass40 rather than Ass42 secretion (7).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Moreover, the artifical putative active site D257A PS1 mutant causes accumulation of APPCTFs without a concomitant reduction in Ass secretion, indicating that accumulation of APPCTFs is not necessarily a direct consequence of decreased Ass production (27).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	29	Recently, several novel mutations, clustered at the -secretase processing site of APP, have been identified (6 to 10).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	30	 To compare their relative effects on -secretase cleavage, we expressed human APP695 with or without the clinical mutants T714I, V715M, V715A, I716V, V717I and V717L in primary cultures of cortical neurones and analysed the full scope of APP metabolites.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We demonstrate that these mutations lead to significantly increased relative Ass42/Ass40 concentrations and that the level of increase is inversely correlated with the age at onset of AD.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, some but not all C-terminal APP mutations also influenced the turnover of APPCTFs, resulting in the accumulation of APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	33	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Effect on Ass secretion We systematically analysed the effect of a series of clinical mutations near the -secretase cleavage site of APP.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	34	 To this end, we expressed human wild-type APP or APP containing either the Austrian T714I (8), French V715M (7), German V715A (C.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	35	Van Broeckhoven, unpublished data), Florida I716V (6), Indiana V717L (9) or London V717I (1) mutation in primary cultures of neurons.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	36	 We specifically immunoprecipitated Ass40 or Ass42 from the conditioned medium using antibody FCA3340 or antibody FCA3542, respectively (28).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	37	 All APP C-terminal mutations with the exception of V715M, increased Ass1 to 42 secretion (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The increase in Ass1 to 42 ranged from 1.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	39	 This was accompanied by an increase in the N-truncated Ass-isoforms ending at residue 42 (Assx-42).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	40	 These isoforms run in the gels as doublet bands (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	41	 1B), and are presumably generated by alternative ss-secretase activity at amino acid residue 11 (19,29) or by -secretase activity at amino acid residue 17 (30) of the Ass sequence.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Ass1 to 40, on the other hand, is decreased with most mutations.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The T714I, V715M and V715A mutations reduce Ass1 to 40 secretion most drastically to 20, 30 and 55% of the wild-type levels, respectively.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The V717I and V717L mutations affect Ass40 secretion to a lesser extent and the I716V mutation has apparently no effect on Ass40 secretion (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The secretion of N-truncated Ass40 isoforms (Assx-40) was decreased to an extent comparable to Ass1 to 40.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	65	 No significant differences in levels of sAPP between any of the mutants and wild-type APP were observed (data not shown), in agreement with the assumption that those mutations mainly affect -secretase processing of APP.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	76	  We further investigated whether the accumulation of APPCTFs observed with the T714I mutation was the consequence of reduced degradation or increased production.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Therefore pulse-chase experiments were performed and the turnover rate of wild-type and mutant CTFs was assessed.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	78	 As can be appreciated from Figure 4A and B, the turnover rate of the APP holoprotein is more or less identical for wild-type and mutant APP.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In contrast, the turnover rates of wild-type APPCTFS or APPI716VCTFs is faster than the turnover rates of the APPCTFs containing the T714I or V717I mutation (Fig.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The radioactive signals are normalized to the signal obtained for APP holoprotein at time zero.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Data are representative for two independent experiments.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	91	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   The common feature of all APP C-terminal mutations tested in the current study, is the significant increase in the relative ratio of Ass42 to Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	92	 By far the largest increase (8.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	93	20-fold) was observed with the T714I mutant, corroborating our previous data in HEK-293 cells (8).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It is striking that this mutant is also clinically the most aggressive one and displays an unusually early age of onset of 34 years, compared to other APP mutations.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	95	 It will be interesting to test this mutant in APP transgenic mice, anticipating the rapid development of amyloid plaques and disease in these animals.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	96	 More importantly, by systematically analysing an extended series of C-terminal APP mutants in a single neuronal expression paradigm, we were able to demonstrate for the first time a clear inverse correlation between Ass42/Ass40 ratio and age of onset for the APP mutations, which strongly supports (a variant of) the  amyloid peptide hypothesis .
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	97	 It should be mentioned that in APP V717I families age of onset is apparently modulated by the APOE genotype with APOE4 decreasing and APOE2 increasing the age of onset (31,32).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The other APP mutations were found in single families and APOE data is too sparse to allow analysis of APOE effect on age of onset (http://molgen-www.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Our correlation data also contrast with the observation that in PS1 families, age of onset is not inversely correlated with Ass42 secretion (33 to 35).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	100	 In these families, age of onset is also not influenced by APOE genotype (36).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Remarkably, the observed correlation only holds true when the relative levels of Ass42 to Ass40 are considered.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It is not completely clear why absolute amounts of Ass42 do not correlate with age at onset of disease.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	103	 A  protective  role of Ass40 seems unlikely since Ass40 levels by themselves are not correlated with age at onset of disease (data not shown).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	104	At the level of -secretase processing, the different mutations apparently have slightly different effects.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Mutations at codons 714 (T714I) and 715 (V715A and V715M) appear to primarily affect the 40-cleavage and cause a decreased secretion of Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Mutations at codons 716 (I716V) and 717 (V717I and V717L) predominantly affect the 42-cleavage and increase Ass42 secretion.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Hence, pathogenic APP mutations exert their largest effect on the cleavage site which is located two or three residues more N-terminal to the substitution (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	108	 This suggests that the residues in the P3' and P4' positions are of particular importance for the exposure of the scissile bounds to the catalytic sites of the -secretase protease(s).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Remarkably, the drastic decreases in Ass40 secretion observed with the mutations at codons 714 and 715 are not clearly accompanied by a large increase in Ass42 secretion.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	110	 However, as we demonstrated previously for the APP T714I mutation (8), Ass isoforms ending at residues 39, 38 and to a lesser extent 37 may counterbalance the decrease in Ass40.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Overall, it follows that the ratio of Ass42 to Ass40 is the best indicator of the severity of the disease in patients with APP mutations.

0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Note that both types of residues are located at opposite sides of the helix (separated by the bold dashed line).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	121	  Unexpectedly, APP C-terminal mutations also influence the levels of APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The T714I, V717I and V717L mutations cause the accumulation of APPCTFs in neurons, whereas the V715A, V715M or I716V mutations have no significant effect on APPCTF levels.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Both - and ss-secretase-generated APPCTFs increase approximately to the same extent.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	124	 This elevation is not clearly accompanied by increased secretion of the sAPP, indicating that the accumulation of APPCTFs is not the direct result of increased - or ss-secretase processing of APP.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Increased levels of APPCTFs could also result from reduced -secretase activity (23).
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	126	 It could be envisaged that the presence of the C-terminal APP mutation reduces -secretase activity.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Since Ass40 is the major Ass isoform produced, a specific reduction of the 40 cleavage could theoretically explain the accumulation of APPCTFs while maintaining Ass42 levels at a pathogenic level.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	128	 However, the APP mutations that drastically decreased Ass40 secretion (V715A and V715M) did not display APPCTF accumulation, whereas the others (V717I and V717L) did not significantly affect Ass40 secretion but accumulated APPCTFs.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Therefore, the effect of the latter mutations on APPCTF metabolism must occur independently from the -secretase cleavage step.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Our pulse to chase data indicated a reduced turnover rate of these mutant CTFs, suggesting that these APP mutations not only affect -secretase processing, but also the catabolic pathways that degrade these fragments.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Accumulation of APPCTFs was shown before with the Swedish and London APP mutants K670N/M671L, V717I, V717F and V717G (37), in agreement with our findings.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	132	 (37) proposed that APPCTFss is linked to a signalling transduction pathway.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Accumulation of APPCTFss was speculated to disrupt this pathway, leading to cytoskeletal abnormalities and neurodegeneration.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, our data show that accumulation of APPCTFs is not a consistent feature of all APP mutants causing AD.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	135	 In fact, mutations V717I and I716V result in a very similar mean age of onset, whereas APPCTFs accumulate with the former but not with the latter.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Therefore, accumulation of APPCTFs is likely a less important factor in the overall pathogenesis of the disease.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	137	 It would be of interest to investigate these different mutations at the pathological level in the brain of patients.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Unfortunately, no material is yet available from patients with mutations that do not cause APPCTF accumulation, i.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	139	 mutations at positions 715 or 716 of the APP sequence.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	140	Finally, we propose a molecular model that integrates our observations.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	141	 If one presumes an -helical conformation for the transmembraneous part of APP (38) (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	142	 5B), then the mutations at residues 714 and 715, which primarily affect 40-secretase cleavage, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 716 and 717, which predominantly affect 42-secretase cleavage, are located at the opposite side.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It should be noted that the mutations at residues 714 and 717, leading to accumulation of APPCTFs, are located at one side of the helix, whereas mutations at residues 715 and 716, which do not lead to accumulation of APPCTFs are at the other side (Fig.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Our recent unpublished data (W.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	145	De Strooper) demonstrated that the region in APP spanning the currently investigated clinical mutations is involved in the direct binding of APP to PS1.
0.3937268.11487570.html.plaintext.txt	146	 We speculate, therefore, that the investigated clinical mutations cause subtle changes in the binding interaction between PS1 and APP, and therefore mainly affect exposure of the scissile bonds to the catalytic site of -secretase The abnormal accumulation of APPCTFs observed with some of the APP mutants could also fit this hypothesis, since the PS1 D257A catalytic site mutant leads to accumulation of APPCTFs without the concomitant reduction in Ass production (27).

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We have examined two types of truncated Notch oncoproteins that arise from proviral insertion into the Notch4 gene (Notch4/int-3) or a chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene (TAN-1).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins lack most or all of their ectodomain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Normal Notch signaling requires -secretase/presenilin-mediated proteolytic processing, but whether Notch oncoproteins are also dependent on -secretase/presenilin activity is not known.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We demonstrate that Notch4/int-3-induced activation of the downstream transcription factor, CSL, is abrogated in cells deficient in presenilins or treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of -secretase/presenilins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Furthermore, we find that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 accumulate at the cell surface, where presenilin-dependent cleavage occurs, when -secretase/presenilin activity is inhibited.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	10	 -Secretase/presenilin inhibition effectively blocks cellular responses to Notch4/int-3, but not TAN-1, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides lack transmembrane domains and do not require -secretase/presenilin activity for nuclear access.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	11	 These studies highlight potential uses and limitations of -secretase/presenilin inhibitors in targeted therapy of Notch-related neoplasms.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Notch proteins are a family of single-pass transmembrane receptors that regulate cell fate decisions during development, including the differentiation of arterial versus venous fates in the vascular system (1) and T cell versus B cell development in the immune system (2, 3).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Appropriate levels of Notch signaling are critical for normal development because loss of Notch signaling or excessive Notch signaling leads to embryonic lethal phenotypes (4, 5).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Additionally, abnormal activation of several Notch proteins is associated with tumorigenesis, including a subset of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	15	In vertebrates, full-length Notch proteins are part of a family of four receptors (Notch1 to 4) and five ligands that include members of the Jagged and Delta families.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Notch receptors have an extracellular (EC) domain consisting largely of multiple epidermal growth factor-like repeats within which are binding sites for ligands.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The Notch receptors also have a cytoplasmic region containing the RAM domain, seven ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Newly synthesized Notch receptors are processed initially in the trans-Golgi by a furin-like convertase, generating a ligand binding ectodomain and a transmembrane signaling domain that remain associated during transport to the plasma membrane (6 to 8).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Ligand binding to the ectodomain induces several successive proteolytic cleavage events in the transmembrane subunit that result in release of its intracellular domain from the cell membrane.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	20	 An initial cleavage by ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease)-type metalloproteases occurs just external to the transmembrane (TM) domain (9, 10) and serves to facilitate additional cleavages by -secretases/presenilins within the TM domain (11).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Mammalian presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2), are polytopic membrane proteins that appear to function as aspartyl proteases within a high molecular mass multiprotein complex that also includes the proteins nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (12 to 15).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Presenilins provide the active site of the -secretase proteolytic activity (16).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	23	Presenilin-mediated cleavage is involved in activation of all four mammalian Notch receptors (17, 18), and in the case of Notch1, it occurs at several sites within the TM domain (19).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Notch1 cleavage is prevented by the addition of -secretase inhibitors or mutations within critical aspartate residues of presenilin (20, 21).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Delta-1-induced signaling through Notch1 is also reduced in cells deficient in presenilins or in cells treated with -secretase inhibitors (21 to 23).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Presenilins have recently been recognized as having multiple substrates in addition to Notch, including -amyloid precursor protein, ErbB4, N- and E-cadherins, and CD44 (24 to 28).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Presenilins are necessary, after ectodomain shedding, for the cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of the intracellular domains of each of these polypeptides (11, 25, 27 to 29).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the case of Notch, presenilin-mediated cleavage allows the Notch intracellular domain (IC) to gain access to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CBF1/CSL.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This binding event converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator, leading to expression of target genes (30).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	30	Notch signaling is normally activated by the interaction of a Notch receptor with ligand expressed on an adjacent cell.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Truncated forms of Notch containing deletions spanning most, or all, of the EC domain bypass the need for ligand binding and signal constitutively.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Two such Notch deletions, involving mouse Notch4 and human Notch1 (initially named TAN-1 for translocation-associated Notch homolog-1), were originally identified as oncogenes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The int-3 oncogene, which we refer to as Notch4/int-3, arises from retroviral integration of the mouse mammary tumor virus into the Notch4 locus and causes murine mammary tumors (31 to 33).

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In a similar fashion, the TAN-1 oncogene associated with T-ALL is generated from a truncation in human Notch1 caused by a recurrent (7, 9) chromosomal translocation involving the Notch1 gene and the T cell receptor gene (34).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	36	 All breakpoints identified to date occur within the intron just prior to the exon encoding the 34th epidermal growth factor repeat and result in fusion of the 3'-end of Notch1 to T cell receptor promoter/enhancer elements.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The fusion gene drives expression of multiple truncated mRNAs that encode a series of N-terminally truncated TAN-1 polypeptides ranging in size from slightly larger to slightly smaller than the normal Notch1 transmembrane subunit (35).

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Like Notch4/int-3, some TAN-1 polypeptides are inserted into membranes and depend on proteolytic cleavage by presenilins (mTAN-1); some TAN-1 polypeptides, however, may not be localized to the cell surface and are targeted to the nucleus in a presenilin-independent manner (cTAN-1).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	46	  To understand the mechanism of action and activities of Notch, engineered Notch proteins that are constitutively active have been studied.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These engineered Notch proteins include forms either consisting of only the IC, or the IC linked to the TM domain, a small portion of the EC domain, and the leader peptide (NotchE).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Both of these forms are active in a variety of assays and are oncogenic (36 to 38), but only NotchE depends on presenilin for activity (18, 39).

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	50	In this study, we asked whether Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1, oncogenic forms of Notch proteins, require presenilins for proper processing, signaling function, and activity.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Based on the known sites of truncation within the Notch1 and Notch4 genes during their oncogenic conversion, both TAN-1 and Notch4/int-3 are predicted to encode proteins including TM domains, but lacking signal peptides.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	52	 It was thus unclear whether these oncoproteins would insert into membranes and require presenilin activity for activation.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Although blockade of presenilin function alters TAN-1 processing, it does not affect the growth of T-ALL cells, apparently because some TAN-1 polypeptides bypass the requirement for presenilin processing for nuclear access.

0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	268	 We demonstrate that -secretase/presenilin cleavage is a general requirement for the activation of the Notch signaling pathway via both Notch1 and Notch2.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This conclusion is based on the finding that -secretase/presenilin inhibition greatly reduced the ability of Notch1 and Notch2 receptors to activate CSL upon exposure to the ligand Jagged1, Delta-1, or Delta-4.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Our studies are consistent with the observation that Notch1 to 4E polypeptides all require -secretase/presenilin to activate CSL (17, 18).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	271	 The Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 oncoproteins are also truncated and lack most of the EC domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	272	 However, unlike the engineered NotchE proteins, Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 do not possess signal peptides, and it was thus unclear whether these polypeptides would be inserted into membranes and require -secretase/presenilin for downstream signaling.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Our studies demonstrate that both Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 polypeptides are inserted in membranes and that treatment with a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor results in the accumulation of Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 proteins at the cell surface.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	274	Membrane Targeting of Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 Presenilins and Notch interact early in the secretory pathway within the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum (51), even with Notch constructs devoid of most of the EC domain (50, 51).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Perhaps this association promotes membrane insertion of truncated Notch polypeptides lacking signal peptides but retaining TM domains.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	276	 After insertion, truncated Notch would be competent for transport to the cell surface as part of a complex containing presenilin.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	277	 This is consistent with coimmunoprecipitation experiments showing that most Notch proteins targeted to the membrane are associated with presenilin (50).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Presenilins are expressed at the membrane in a biologically active complex with nicastrin (15, 56), and membrane-tethered Notch has also been observed in a complex with nicastrin (14).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Thus, it is possible that the affinity between Notch and presenilin and/or nicastrin mediates the localization of Notch oncoproteins to the cell surface.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	280	The idea that presenilins assist in the cell surface targeting of Notch is supported by studies on the role of presenilins in the trafficking of -amyloid precursor protein (APP) (56, 57).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	281	 Aberrant processing of -amyloid precursor protein by presenilin is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In addition to this role, presenilins are also necessary in the trafficking of -amyloid precursor protein from the trans-Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (57) and from the cell surface to endosomes (56).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Additionally, presenilins are required for the proper maturation and trafficking of nicastrin to the cell membrane (58 to 60).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	284	 Presenilins may serve a similar function in the trafficking of Notch.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Such a function would be independent of proteolytic activity because mutations of critical aspartate residues abrogate the proteolytic activity of presenilin without affecting trafficking of Notch to the cell surface (21).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	286	Differential Effects of Presenilin Inhibitor on Biological Activity Mediated through TAN-1 and Notch4/int-3 Although Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 polypeptides both exhibit altered proteolytic processing and accumulate at the cell surface when presenilin activity is blocked, -secretase/presenilin inhibition yields different effects on the biological activity of these oncoproteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The biological activity of Notch4/int-3 was examined in a bioassay established to detect endothelial sprouting from HUVEC.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Notch4/int-3 induced a strong sprouting response in this assay, demonstrating a role for Notch4 signaling in the initial processes of angiogenesis, an effect that was almost completely inhibited by a -secretase/presenilin inhibitor.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	289	 These studies suggest that blockade of presenilin activity may be a means of inhibiting Notch-mediated angiogenesis, which could be a useful tool in regulating tumor-associated angiogenesis.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	290	The biological activity of TAN-1 was studied in a growth assay of SUPT1 cells, which have two truncated and no normal Notch1 genes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	291	 SUPT1 cells contain increased levels of nuclear Notch1 and required persistent Notch1 signaling for growth, based on the effect of dominant-negative inhibitors of N1IC/CSL function (40).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	292	 However, SUPT1 cell growth is unaffected by CpdE, despite evidence of altered TAN-1 processing and accumulation of TAN-1 polypeptides at the cell surface.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	293	 The unresponsiveness of SUPT1 cells may be the result of the expression of TAN-1 polypeptides that are not dependent on presenilin-mediated proteolysis for nuclear access.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	294	 Specifically, the smallest TAN-1 polypeptide detected in SUPT1 whole cell lysates was unaltered by CpdE (Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	295	 This polypeptide may arise from a cryptic translational start site downstream of the region encoding the extracellular domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Such aberrant initiation codons have been demonstrated within the TM domains of murine Notch1 (61) and feline Notch2 (62).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	297	 Whether such sites are purely pathophysiologic or utilized under some normal circumstances is unknown.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	298	 We hypothesize that this TAN-1 polypeptide accesses the nucleus in a presenilin-independent fashion, accounting for the refractoriness of SUPT1 cells to presenilin blockade.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	299	Model for Notch4/int-3 and TAN-1 Cleavage by Presenilins  Our studies are consistent with current models for Notch processing and activation (9, 63) illustrated in Fig.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	300	 These models propose that the Notch receptor is normally inhibited from proteolytic processing because of conformational constraints imposed by the EC domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	301	 Ligand binding may induce structural changes that allow for proteolytic cleavage by TACE (tumor necrosis-alpha-converting enzyme) and other metalloproteases and the consequent shedding of most of the EC domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	302	 This then enables the subsequent proteolysis mediated by presenilins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	303	 Gain of function mutations of Notch could either act independently of presenilin or function only after presenilin-mediated cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Our studies indicate that there are both presenilin-dependent and -independent forms of the TAN-1 oncoproteins.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	305	It is still controversial whether presenilins recognize a specific consensus sequence within Notch that is required for its cleavage.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	306	 All four Notch receptors are cleaved by presenilin at a conserved valine within the TM domain, and mutation of this valine residue within Notch1 and Notch4 greatly reduces the efficiency of cleavage (18).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	307	 However, Notch cleavage is also observed at another site within the TM domain N-terminal to the conserved valine (19).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Additionally, studies in Drosophila show that it is the size of the Notch EC domain that is critical to whether presenilin can cleave, such that the shorter the EC domain the more efficient the cleavage (63).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	309	 This lack of cleavage site specificity was also observed for other substrates and suggests that presenilins may serve a general role in facilitating the cleavage of particular single-pass TM proteins with short EC domains.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	310	Notch Oncoproteins and Cancer N-terminal truncations within the Notch proteins can lead to oncogenic gain of function phenotypes.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Such truncations are observed in human T-ALLs with chromosomal translocations of Notch1, or in T-ALLs in mice and cats with proviral insertions into Notch1 (64), or Notch2 (65), respectively, and in murine mammary tumors with proviral insertions into Notch4 (33, 66).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Interestingly, various human tumor cell lines exhibit up-regulation of a RNA species encoding for a truncated form of Notch4 that also has transforming potential (67).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	313	 From our studies, one might predict that regulation of presenilin-mediated proteolysis and subsequent activation of these Notch oncoproteins is dependent upon whether the protein encodes for the TM domain.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	314	In tumors driven by Notch oncoproteins containing the TM domain, -secretase/presenilin inhibitors may be an effective therapy.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The Notch4/int-3 oncoprotein is a potent mammary oncogene that is dependent on presenilin for signal activation and function.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	316	 In addition, ligand-dependent signaling through full-length Notch receptors may also be important in some neoplasms.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	317	 For example, ligand-dependent activation of full-length Notch receptors contributes to the growth of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines (68).
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Many neoplasms express one or more Notch receptors, but reliable means of measuring Notch activation, which can be mediated by very low levels of nuclear Notch, are not readily available.
0.5472486.15123653.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Presenilin inhibitors may be generally useful tools in evaluating the role of Notch signaling in various neoplasms.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Presenilin (PS) 1 and PS 2 are required for intramembrane cleavage of an increasing number of type I membrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease and the Notch receptor, which signals during differentiation and development.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Mutagenesis, affinity labeling, biochemical isolation, and reconstitution in cells reveal that PS, in complex with co-factors nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, apparently contains the active site of -secretase, a novel membrane aspartyl protease.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition, other related aspartyl proteases have been identified.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	8	 These include members of the type-4 prepilin peptidase family in bacteria, which are known proteases and carry a GD motif conserved in PS.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A group of multi-pass membrane proteins found in eukaryotes also contain YD and LGXGD motifs in two transmembrane domains that are conserved in PS and postulated to constitute an aspartyl protease active site.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Among these is signal peptide peptidase (SPP), which cleaves remnant signal peptides derived from signal-peptidase-mediated ectodomain shedding.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	11	 SPP cuts type II membrane proteins, illustrating that PS-like proteases play a key role in intramembrane proteolysis of single-pass membrane proteins oriented in either direction.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Conclusion References   The deposition of the amyloid ss protein (Ass) in the form of neuritic plaques is a primary pathological lesion of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Mounting evidence points to the 38-43 residue Ass as an initiator of pathogenesis and not just a molecular bystander.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Strong evidence for this hypothesis comes from genetics: early-onset, dominant forms of familial AD (FAD) are caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), and these mutations affect Ass production.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The 42 residue form of Ass (Ass42) is the predominant Ass species deposited in the limbic and association cortices of both sporadic and familial AD patients (Gravina et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Increased amounts of Ass42 are produced from stably transfected cells and transgenic mice overexpressing mutant presenilin (PS) genes (Borchelt et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Mutations in PS genes account for  > 50% of early-onset FAD (Levy-Lahad et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Although FAD cases represent a minority of all AD cases, the mechanism by which PS mutations affect Ass production and cause FAD should provide insight into the pathogenesis and treatment of sporadic AD as well.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	22	The production of Ass from APP involves sequential proteolysis by ss- and -secretases.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Cleavage by -secretase is heterogeneous and generates C-terminal variations in Ass.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Because FAD mutations in PS increase Ass42 levels in particular, PS must affect the selectivity of -secretase.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Deletion of PS1 in mice is lethal, producing a major disruption of somite segmentation (Shen et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Neurogenesis is impaired, and massive neuronal loss is observed in specific regions (Shen et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality can be rescued by both wild-type and FAD-mutant PS1 (Davis et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	28	, 1998), which indicates that disease-causing PS mutants are at least partially functional.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Cleavage of APP by -secretase in cultured PS1-knockout neurons is markedly inhibited (De Strooper et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	30	, 2000), and PS-/- PS2-/- neurons produce undetectable levels of secreted Ass.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This clearly demonstrates that PS is required for -secretase activity and Ass generation.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	32	Studies with inhibitors have shown that -secretase has characteristics of an aspartyl protease (Shearman et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Identification of two conserved aspartate residues in transmembrane (TM) domains 6 and 7 of PS critical for -secretase activity (D257 and D385 in PS1) provided the conceptual basis for the novel hypothesis that PS is the aspartyl -secretase (Wolfe et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	34	 When either aspartate residue in PS1 (Wolfe et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	36	, 1999) is mutated, -secretase activity is blocked, and Ass levels are significantly reduced in cultured cells.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This was also observed in transgenic mice overexpressing aspartate D257A mutant PS1 (Xia et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Further evidence summarized below suggests that not only is PS an aspartyl protease but an entire class of PS-like proteases is involved in intramembrane proteolysis of both type I and II membrane proteins.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Full-length PS undergoes endoproteolysis to form stable N-terminal (NTF) and C-terminal (CTF) fragments, which remain associated (Borchelt et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Transition state analogue -secretase inhibitors that were designed to target the active site of the protease and efficiently decrease Ass generation in vivo and in vitro bind to both members of the PS NTF-CTF heterodimeric complex, which suggests that the active site lies between the two associated fragments (Esler et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Although the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A binds to both full-length PS and NTF-CTF complexes (Evin et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	44	, 2001), more potent -secretase inhibitors bind only to associated NTF-CTF but not to full-length PS (Esler et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The same inhibitors bind to PS1E9, a PS1 variant that lacks the processing site but is nevertheless functional (Li et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These findings suggest that a conformational change in PS caused by endoproteolysis or deletion of this processing site produces the active protease that is susceptible to exogenous inhibitors.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	47	Besides endoproteolysis of PS to form functional NTF-CTF, its association with other components is apparently also critical for -secretase activity.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Investigation of the PS-containing high-molecular-weight (HMW) complex indicates that additional cofactors intimately associate with PS to form the active -secretase complex.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Nicastrin, which was initially identified from PS1 co-immunoprecipitates (Yu et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	50	, 2000), binds specifically to an immobilized transition state analogue -secretase inhibitor (Esler et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Nicastrin and PS1 NTF-CTF are capable of binding to this immobilized -secretase inhibitor under conditions that also maintain the -secretase activity; conditions disrupting the association of these proteins with the inhibitor also render the complex inactive.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In common with anti-PS1 antibodies, anti-nicastrin antibodies can precipitate the functional -secretase complex (Esler et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Although glycosylation of nicastrin is not absolutely required for -secretase activity (Herreman et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	54	, 2003), mainly the mature form of nicastrin was identified in the HMW -secretase complex, and levels of nicastrin in cells closely correlate with PS levels (Arawaka et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Reduction of PS levels leads to a concomitant reduction in nicastrin levels, and downregulation of nicastrin expression decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Thus, reduction in the amount of either protein decreases Ass generation (Edbauer et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	57	Presenilin is not only involved in the intramembranous processing of APP but also in the processing of and signaling from the Notch receptor (Kopan and Goate, 2002).
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Proper Notch signaling is critical to a wide variety of cell fate determinations during embryonic development and adulthood.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Notch is a type I integral membrane protein that has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	60	 After translation, the receptor is proteolyzed in the trans-Golgi as part of its maturation into a heterodimeric cell surface receptor.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Notch then suffers a second proteolysis as a result of ligand activation, leading to shedding of the extracellular domain of the receptor.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The remaining membrane-bound C-terminal stub is subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain to release the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	63	 This final intramembrane proteolysis is mediated by the multi-component -secretase complex (Fortini, 2002).

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	73	 It does not contain any known protease motif and does not carry a signal peptide.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Interestingly, its chromosomal location (chromosome 19) is close to the ApoE gene.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	75	 The ApoE4 allele is the major risk factor associated with AD.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Inactivation of APH-1 or PEN-2 in cultured Drosophila cells significantly reduces the -secretase cleavage of APP and Notch, and PS NTF-CTF levels are also reduced (Francis et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	77	 In mammalian cells, PEN-2 protein levels are significantly reduced in the absence of PS; downregulation of nicastrin synthesis similarly causes a reduction in PEN-2 levels.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Downregulation of PEN-2 synthesis likewise decreases the levels of stabilized PS molecules and mature nicastrin, with a concomitant reduction in -secretase activity (Steiner et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Reduction of APH-1 levels in mammalian cells also reduces -secretase activity (Lee et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Recent studies have demonstrated that APH-1, PEN-2 and nicastrin directly associate with PS (Gu et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	81	, 2003) and overexpression of these four proteins enhances -secretase activity (Edbauer et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Increased levels of APH-1, PEN-2 and PS1 facilitate PS heterodimer formation, as well as glycosylation of nicastrin (Edbauer et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Thus, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 regulate one another and are indispensable for -secretase activity.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Although reconstitution of PS, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 in yeast leads to PS endoproteolysis and Ass/AICD production (Edbauer et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The two aspartate residues coordinate a water molecule, activating it for cleavage of peptide bonds.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Unlike serine or cysteine proteases, aspartyl proteases do not use nucleophilic attack as part of their mechanism.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Thus, there is no covalent intermediate formed between the enzyme and the substrate (Beynon and Salvesen, 2001).
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Because PS lacks the classic D(T/S)G motif of an aspartyl protease, the conserved D257 and D385 residues may either be critical for the aspartyl protease activity of the HMW -secretase complex or themselves constitute the active site of a novel aspartyl protease that does not carry the classic D(T/S)G motif.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Studies of bacterial aspartyl proteases have shown that the multi-pass type-4 prepilin peptidases (TFPP) likewise lack the D(T/S)G motif but have a conserved GD motif that is also conserved in presenilins and includes the second critical aspartate residue (D385 of PS1).
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	93	 D385A, G384P and G384K mutations in PS1 block proteolysis of the APP and Notch TM region.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	94	 A FAD-causing mutation at this position in PS1 (G384A) instead causes a six-fold increase in Ass42 generation compared with wild-type PS1-expressing cells, but it does not prevent proteolysis of the Notch TM domain (Steiner et al.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The conserved GD motif lies in TM7 of PS1.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	96	 This motif is likewise found on the C-terminal side of the active site of bacterial TFPP, and mutation of the aspartate residue of the GD motif blocks its ability to remove leader peptides from certain substrates (LaPointe and Taylor, 2000).
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Although the primary sequences of PS and TFPP are not highly similar overall, the similar requirement for the aspartate-containing motifs for proteolysis from bacteria to humans suggests that TFPP and PS are novel polytopic membrane aspartyl proteases (Steiner et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Except for the TM1 domain of PS, the sequences of these PS homologues, termed PSHs, loosely align with the PS sequence.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These proteins thus appear to have topologies similar to that of PS.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The YD motif in TM6 and the LGXGD motif in TM7, containing the two key aspartate residues, are conserved in almost all reported PSHs.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In addition, all known PS proteins contain a proline-alanine-leucine-proline (PALP) motif starting at P433 (amino acid numbering based on human PS1) at the C-terminus, and mutation of the first proline of the PALP domain of PS leads to destabilization of the PS high-molecular-weight complex (Tomita et al.

0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This approach is complicated owing to the existence of at least three necessary co-factors for protease activity: nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Although the functions of these co-factors are under extensive investigation, database searches for protease motifs have not revealed any candidates for protease domains in these co-factors.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	162	 By contrast, relatives of PS have emerged as potential proteases carrying the unique putative active site motifs in two TM domains, and these proteins appear to function without the need for other co-factors.
0.49586895.12808018.html.plaintext.txt	163	 The TFPPs, for example, are known proteases carrying the conserved GD motif of PS, but the primary sequences of TFPPs share no other similarity with PS.

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although a few percentage of patients are familial cases linked to mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 genes, the remainder are considered mainly sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, changes in gene expression or other genetic features of the individual can clearly contribute to develop the illness.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Consequently, in this paper we have focused on the identification of new genes, the expression of which is altered in AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We used the technique of differential display reverse transcriptase to polymerase chain reaction (DDRT to PCR) in order to study the gene expression differences in brain tissue from patients in an advanced stage of AD.

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common illnesses of modern society, affecting 10% of population over 65 years, molecular bases of the disease remain unclear.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Familial forms that account for  < 5% of the total number of cases have been linked to mutations in three different genes: the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 (1), the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene on chromosome 14 (2,3) and the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene on chromosome 1 (4,5).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Nevertheless, it is well accepted that some genetic profiles predispose some individuals to suffer the illness more than others, as in case of apolipoprotein 4 (apoE) allele, which has been demonstrated to be a susceptibility gene for AD (6).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	16	The septohippocampal system plays an important role in memory and cognition; how it is affected in AD patients is characterized by a reduction of cholinergic activity and a significant atrophy of the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MS to DBB) that correlates with the grade of cognitive and memory deficits (7).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	17	 As pathological changes that arise in diseases are mostly believed to be driven by changes in gene expression (8 to 10), the aim of this study was to disentangle the different pattern of the genetic expression that characterize AD in the medial septum and hippocampus.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	18	The differential display reverse transcriptase to polymerase chain reaction (DDRT to PCR) technique is quite unique in its potential to visualize the expressed genes in an eukaryotic cell in a systematic, non-biased and sequence-dependent manner by using multiple primer combinations (11).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Thus, this technique allows searching genes differentially expressed in any specific disease.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	20	 DDRT to PCR was used in our laboratory to identify new genes involved in AD and we now report that the KIAA0471 gene is differentially expressed in human brain of several AD patients, including one with a PS1 mutation.

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	61	 As DDRT to PCR method is a powerful technique for identifying differentially expressed transcripts between two or more tissues or cell types of interest (15), our main objective was to apply this technique to identify new genes responsible for expression changes involved in AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In order to carry it out, we analyzed human brain samples of Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls, whose medical history was fully documented.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	63	 This fact limited the number of samples to a few but extremely well qualified patients.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	64	 We followed this approach to avoid false results associated with variations in the patient conditions such as those related with agonal state (tissue pH and terminal medical conditions) (16).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Differences in expression could not be due to differences in the cellular composition of the samples because all the blocks of hippocampus and septum were accurately obtained from the same area.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	66	 As shown by cDNA bands, profiles displayed by all these samples, the limited differences of age and post-mortem interval did not affect the study.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	67	It is important to consider that besides the working problems of human samples and the fact that the human brain is thought to have the greatest complexity of gene expression of any region of the body (17), we obtained clear and sharp DDRT gels, improving the image of the bands compared with previously reported studies (18,19).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	68	We have identified one cDNA that is not expressed in septum or hippocampus of several Alzheimer's patients (including the one with the PS1 mutation).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	69	 As it was necessary to screen  > 35% of total mRNA to observe a difference in AD gene expression, this transcript could be important among the total genes potentially associated with AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The differential mRNA was identified as KIAA0471.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	71	 At this stage, this KIAA0471 mRNA cannot be directly associated with any known protein, but based on its predicted coding region it would be translated into a soluble large protein with a length of 370 amino acids (20) and a molecular weight of 43 kDa.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	72	 This predicted protein presents at least 95% homology with H.

0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Recent experiments by DDRT to PCR reported an upregulation of KIAA0471 gene products in 7 out of 12 cases with esophageal tumors (21).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Studies of predicted KIAA proteins indicate that having multiple domains they may participate in an intricate framework of assembly protein complexes.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Their predicted functions are mainly implied in cell communication/signaling, cell structure/motility or nucleic acid management (22).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This would be in agreement with an increased KIAA0471 expression in proliferative cells and its reduction in the neuronal loss associated with neurodegeneration.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	78	 If true, the absence of KIAA0471 expression evidenced by our results may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of septohippocampal lesion presented in AD.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	79	 At present, studies are being directly conducted to determine entire sequences of human KIAA proteins together with their biological functions and will help to better understand its involvement in a variety of diseases (23).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	80	Lack of expression of KIAA0471 gene in the PS1 mutation patient could be an additional factor that contributes to explain its very early onset dementia and/or early death.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	81	 A possible genetic association of presenilin 2 and KIAA0471 with AD cannot be discarded as both genes map in the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q24 to q25 KIAA0471 and 1q31 to q42 PS2).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	82	 AD mutations in this chromosome result in individuals with a wide range in age of onset (24) and the same is also shown by our results.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A special instability of the 1q chromosome is also suggested by the presentation of genetic abnormalities leading to gliomas (oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas) (25) and ependymomas (26).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	84	 On the other hand, well-characterized diseases sometimes appear linked to genetic mutations in the same loci where KIAA0471 maps (1q24 to q25).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This is the case of type 2 diabetes (27), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (28) and hereditary prostate cancer 1 (29).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	86	 At present, no direct relationship with AD has been established for most of these diseases, except the recently recognized association among hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and AD (30) and the insulin-degrading enzyme activity on ss-amyloid peptides (31 to 33).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Therefore, knowledge of the function of KIAA0471 protein in the future could elucidate their possible relationship.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	88	 This deficiency in KIAA0471 only showed up in male individuals and, though only one AD woman was included in this study, further study will be necessary to disentangle whether there is a link to gender.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	89	Further work is needed to determine what causes this lack of expression.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Among these, it could be due to a mutation in the KIAA0471 gene that results in an altered or missing mRNA (upstream effect) or simply to an ulterior suppresion of mRNA production by another factor (downstream effect).
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	91	 At this moment, we are beginning new assays using microchips with DNA probes and specific antibodies against the predicted KIAA047 protein; these new attempts are aimed to understand the difference of gene expression found in this study using DDRT to PCR technique.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The study of the incidence of KIAA0471 mRNA deficit in Alzheimer's patients in a wide population sample, both in brain tissue and in blood, will give a key information for a better diagnosis of the disease in future.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	93	In conclusion, we found for the first time a strong reduction of the KIAA0471 gene expression in several AD patients, including one with the PS1 mutation.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The predicted defective protein presents 95% homology with IDN4-GGTR sequences.
0.41595346.15367492.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This identification of a new genetic defect may give new clues to explain the pathogenesis of the AD process and be a new starting point for the design of rational diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Presenilin-induced apoptosis is cell autonomous and can be blocked by constitutive Notch activation, suggesting that the increased cell death is due to a developmental mechanism that eliminates improperly specified cell types.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	13	ALZHEIMER'S disease is the most common cause of senile dementia in humans, and is characterized neuropathologically by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and selective neuronal loss in certain brain regions (reviewed in Price et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Dying neurons display characteristic features of apoptosis, a genetically controlled mechanism for the removal of harmful or superfluous cells in development and in many diseases (reviewed in Jacobson et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Mutations in three genes, amyloid precursor protein (APP)1, presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2), account for most cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Haass 1997 ; Selkoe 1998 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	16	 APP undergoes complex proteolytic processing that generates the amyloid peptides present in the amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue (reviewed in Haass and Selkoe 1993 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The two human presenilin proteins, PS1 and PS2, are closely related membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains and a large hydrophilic loop.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Human and murine presenilins are widely expressed and localized predominantly in the ER and Golgi compartments (reviewed in Haass 1997 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Several studies have shown that Alzheimer's disease-associated mutant variants of presenilin lead to elevated levels of the more neurotoxic 42-amino acid amyloid peptide (Ass42), relative to the more benign 40-amino acid peptide (Ass40; reviewed in Haass 1997 ; Selkoe 1998 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, presenilin proteins have been identified independently as facilitators of Notch/Lin-12 developmental signaling (Levitan and Greenwald 1995 ; Li and Greenwald 1997 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	21	Numerous studies have examined pro- and antiapoptotic activities of wild-type and mutant PS proteins in mammalian cultured cells or primary neuronal cultures in view of the potential involvement of apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Initially, overexpression of an Alzheimer's disease-linked mutant of PS1 in cultured PC12 cells revealed that mutant, but not wild-type, PS1 increases cellular vulnerability to apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal or addition of ss-amyloid (Guo et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Similarly, overexpression of wild-type PS2 and an Alzheimer's disease-related mutant PS2 form in PC12 cells increases the sensitivity of cells to these apoptotic stimuli, and mutant forms exhibit enhanced apoptotic activity (Deng et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	24	 1996 ; Janicki and Monteiro 1997 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Presenilin-1 forms a complex with ss-catenin that protects neurons from amyloid-ss to induced apoptosis, and this complex is destabilized by familial Alzheimer's disease-linked PS1 mutant proteins in human cell lines and brain tissue (Zhang et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These observations support the idea that enhanced neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease brain tissues may be due to increased apoptotic activity of presenilin caused by the autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Moreover, COOH-terminal fragments of PS1 or PS2 generated either by caspase-mediated proteolysis or by alternative transcriptional initiation have antiapoptotic properties (Vito et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	28	 However, the different pro- and antiapoptotic effects of various PS proteins or PS proteolytic fragments deduced from various studies are difficult to reconcile, and a recent study suggests that overexpression of wild-type PS1 and an Alzheimer's disease-linked PS1 mutant have no discernible effects on apoptosis in cultured primary cortical neurons (Bursztajn et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	29	 All studies examining the apoptotic activities of presenilin so far have been performed in cultured cells using overexpression techniques, which may account for the contradictory results obtained (Barinaga 1998 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	30	 No data exist pertaining to the apoptotic activities of the C.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	31	 elegans presenilin homologues Sel-12 and Hop-1.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It is therefore important to investigate presenilin-mediated apoptosis in the context of a well-defined, multicellular experimental organism, using both traditional genetic methods and overexpression approaches that parallel the mammalian work performed to date.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	33	We therefore analyzed the apoptotic phenotypes of Drosophila Presenilin (Psn) loss-of-function mutants and transgenic flies expressing wild-type Psn or various mutant proteins.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Enhanced apoptosis is observed in both Psn loss-of-function mutants and in transgenic fly tissues that express high levels of Psn.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Overexpression of wild-type Psn induces apoptosis in imaginal eye discs in a cell autonomous manner, resulting in a roughened external eye phenotype in adult flies.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	36	 This phenotype is highly sensitive to Notch gene dosage or Notch receptor activation, suggesting that the apoptosis may occur as a developmental response to aberrant cell signaling and cell-fate specification.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We also expressed four different Alzheimer's disease-related mutant forms and three other presenilin fragments in the developing eye.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In contrast to previous studies demonstrating that Alzheimer's disease-linked substitutions in PS1 or PS2 have enhanced apoptotic activity, all the Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations that we tested have reduced apoptotic activity compared with wild-type, and thus may represent partial loss-of-function mutations.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Since elevated levels of apoptosis are also a feature of the Drosophila Psn loss-of-function mutant phenotype, we propose that the proapoptotic activities of mammalian and fly PS proteins may be due to a dominant negative effect, rather than a gain of Psn function.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	40	 This idea is supported by our finding that overexpression of Psn in S2 cells specifically blocks Notch protein synthesis, resulting in lower levels of immature 300-kD Notch and processed 120-kD COOH-terminal fragments.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Transgenic flies expressing presenilin provide a genetic model in which the activity of additional Alzheimer's disease-related PS mutations can be assayed in vivo, and in which other components of presenilin-mediated biological processes may be identified by genetic screens.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	75	Psn Loss-of-function Mutations Lead to Increased Apoptosis in Drosophila Tissues In view of the extensive neuronal cell death seen in Alzheimer's disease, and the increased susceptibility of cultured cells to apoptotic stimuli caused by overexpression of normal and mutant variants of mammalian PS proteins, we sought to determine whether presenilin is associated with apoptosis in a genetically tractable experimental organism.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	76	 We therefore produced loss-of-function genetic lesions in the Drosophila Presenilin (Psn) gene (Ye et al.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	188	 These observations raise the possibility that the apoptotic effects of PS overexpression may be due to a primary interference with Notch signaling, followed by elimination of cells that have not adopted their proper cell fate by a normal corrective mechanism of developmentally controlled apoptosis (reviewed in Bonini and Fortini 1999 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	189	Our in vivo genetic model for Psn-mediated apoptosis allowed us to examine the potential involvement of Notch signaling in the apoptotic response, an important issue that has not been possible to assess in the widely used mammalian cell culture assays for Psn-induced apoptosis.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	190	 First, we wished to determine if the UAS-Psn constructs that cause apoptosis in the Drosophila eye when driven by GMR-GAL4 are able to produce Notch pathway phenotypes in other tissues when expressed using suitable GAL4 driver constructs.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	191	 We found that several GAL4 driver lines that are active in the wing and cuticle anlagen are indeed capable of producing adult Notch-like phenotypes in the wing blade and thorax, including wing margin notching, vein thickening, ectopic wing margin bristles, ectopic wing vein campaniform sensilla, ectopic thoracic macrochaetae, and missing thoracic microchaetae (Figure 7).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	192	 These phenotypes are consistent with the notion that Psn overexpression leads to dominant-negative effects, since Psn loss-of-function mutants exhibit similar Notch-like phenotypes (Struhl and Greenwald 1999 ; Ye et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	193	 To determine if Psn-induced apoptosis might be an indirect effect of reduced Notch activity, we first analyzed apoptosis in imaginal wing discs of the conditional temperature-sensitive Notch mutant Nts1.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	246	 However, other studies have shown that overexpression of PS1 and PS2 in mammalian cell lines sensitizes the cells to apoptosis induced by trophic factor withdrawal or Ass peptide, indicating that presenilin may promote cell death triggered by certain stimuli (Guo et al.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	250	 We therefore sought to analyze the role of presenilin in promoting or preventing apoptosis in a multicellular experimental organism using both classical genetics and a transgenic approach that closely parallels the overexpression strategies used in the mammalian cell culture studies.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	251	Using several loss-of-function lesions in the endogenous Drosophila Presenilin gene, we showed that mutant tissues lacking Psn activity display elevated levels of developmental apoptosis.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Imaginal tissues are considerably smaller than age-matched wild-type control tissues, suggesting that apoptosis plays a significant role in reducing cell numbers in the Psn mutants.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	253	 High levels of apoptosis are correlated with selective loss of photoreceptor neurons in imaginal eye discs of the mutants, consistent with suggestions that mammalian PS proteins may normally function as antiapoptotic factors required to protect neurons from degeneration.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	254	 However, it is worth noting that apoptotic bodies are also readily detected in other cell types of the Psn mutants, indicating that the antiapoptotic effects are not limited to neuronal tissues in Drosophila.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	255	 Our loss-of-function genetic analysis is in agreement with a recent study showing that antisense inhibition of PS1 in mammalian cell culture blocks neuronal differentiation and induces apoptosis (Hong et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	256	In our transgenic overexpression model, we find that wild-type Psn is most efficient at inducing apoptosis.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	257	 Since Psn overexpression causes phenotypes that resemble Psn loss-of-function mutant apoptotic phenotypes, the proapoptotic activity of overexpressed Psn may actually be due to dominant-negative effects.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	258	 Perhaps cells overexpressing Psn undergo apoptosis not because of a specific regulatory role of Psn in apoptosis, but rather due to a blockage of essential intracellular protein transport pathways by overaccumulation of Psn in the ER and Golgi compartments.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Alternatively, overexpression of Psn may interfere with endogenous Psn function, resulting in phenotypes resembling those of Psn loss-of-function mutants.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	260	 It has been shown previously that both NH2- and COOH-terminal PS1 fragments form oligomers in vitro (Seeger et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	261	 It is therefore possible that overexpression of wild-type Psn in vivo may promote excess or premature Psn oligomerization, resulting in the formation of nonfunctional complexes that deplete endogenous functional Psn within the cell or disrupt ER/Golgi compartment function.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	262	Apoptosis and Impaired Notch Receptor Synthesis Our results suggest that the apoptotic effects of presenilin proteins may involve their well-documented role in Notch signaling (Levitan and Greenwald 1995 ; Li and Greenwald 1997 ; Wong et al.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	264	 elegans, the presenilin homologue Sel-12 is needed for normal cell-surface accumulation of the Lin-12 protein, a member of the Notch receptor family (Levitan and Greenwald 1998 ), and in Drosophila and mammals, presenilin is required for normal proteolytic processing of Notch during receptor assembly or ligand-induced signaling (De Strooper et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	265	 1999 ; Struhl and Greenwald 1999 ; Ye et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We show here that the apoptotic effects of fly Psn are strongly dependent upon Notch gene dosage, and that the effects can be partially suppressed by supplying flies with constitutively activated Notch protein.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Moreover, when Psn overexpression is restricted to certain developing structures, we observe typical Notch-like wing and neurogenic phenotypes.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Based on these results, we suggest that the apoptotic effects of Psn overexpression may be a secondary consequence of impaired Notch signaling, perhaps due to a dominant-negative effect that interferes with Notch activity, resulting in cells that are developmentally misprogrammed and thus selectively eliminated by a normal corrective mechanism of apoptosis.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	269	 This interpretation is consistent with the observation that increased amounts of cell death are correlated with reduced Notch signaling (Figure 9; Rulifson and Blair 1995 ; Jehn et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	270	 As discussed above, previous studies have shown that Psn protein self-aggregates under some conditions (Seeger et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	271	 1997 ); similar aggregation might interfere with ER/Golgi compartment function in vivo.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Our finding that overexpression of Psn in S2 cells leads to reduced Notch protein levels is consistent with this notion and provides a plausible molecular explanation for the Psn overexpression apoptotic and neurogenic phenotypes.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	273	 This dominant-negative effect on Notch synthesis is distinct from the effect of Psn loss-of-function mutations, which cause overaccumulation of specific ~120-kD Notch COOH-terminal fragments at the expense of other fragments (Ye et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	274	Alzheimer's Disease-linked Presenilin Mutations Are Partial Loss-of-function Alleles We have assessed the proapoptotic activity of different Alzheimer's disease-linked mutant variants and found that they possess less apoptotic activity than wild-type presenilin, consistent with the idea that this class of presenilin mutations represents partial loss-of-function mutations in nematodes and transgenic mice (Levitan et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	275	 In contrast to previous studies showing that Alzheimer's disease-associated missense mutations enhance the ability of PS1 and PS2 to induce cell death and that the COOH-terminal ALG-3 fragment blocks the proapoptotic activity of PS2 (Vito et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	276	 1997 ), the corresponding missense mutants of fly Psn induce less cell death than wild-type Psn, and the Drosophila Psn COOH-terminal D-ALG3 fragment appears to induce apoptosis only weakly in vivo.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	277	 In view of the dominant-negative role that we suggest for overexpressed Psn, the reduced apoptotic activity of these mutant variants may reflect a decreased ability to interfere with endogenous presenilin function or a more rapid clearance of misfolded mutant proteins from the ER/Golgi compartment.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Analogous partial loss-of-function effects on Ass secretion of human mutant presenilins may be relatively weak under physiological conditions, but may contribute to gradual deterioration of brain tissue during the aging process and eventually trigger disease onset when neuronal loss reaches a certain threshold.

0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	280	 1995 ), we have shown that the rough eye phenotypes associated with Psn overexpression are partially suppressed when DIAPs or baculoviral p35 is coexpressed using the same promoter.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	281	 This result confirms that apoptosis induced by overexpression of Psn is a major cause of the final adult eye phenotype, regardless of its developmental origins.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	282	 In addition, the Psn effects are most likely to occur at a step upstream of the conserved caspase effector pathway of apoptosis or via a parallel pathway, since Psn-induced cell death is inhibited by p35, which antagonizes caspase activity, and DIAPs, which may block the ability of the Drosophila Reaper protein to activate the caspase effector cascade (Hay et al.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	283	 1995 ; McCall and Steller 1997 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	284	 It has been previously demonstrated that cells rescued from apoptosis can be physiologically functional, since blocking cell death by inhibiting caspase activity prevents blindness in Drosophila neurodegeneration mutants (Davidson and Steller 1998 ).
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In this regard, our results support the notion that preventing neuronal apoptosis may be a useful therapeutic strategy for counteracting the neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	286	In summary, we demonstrate that both loss of Drosophila Psn activity and overexpression of Psn in the developing fly retina induce programmed cell death in a cell autonomous manner.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	287	 The apoptotic effects of Psn may result from dominant-negative effects of the overexpressed presenilin, and are likely to be a consequence of interfering with Notch-mediated developmental signaling by impeding Notch synthesis.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	288	 Apoptotic effects of fly Psn, and perhaps also those caused by mammalian PS proteins, may thus reflect the normal elimination of aberrant cells generated by a primary failure in intercellular communication and cell-fate specification.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In addition, we demonstrate that Alzheimer's disease-linked Presenilin mutations may be partial loss-of-function mutations using different genetic criteria.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Furthermore, Psn-induced rough eye phenotypes are highly sensitive to transgene dosages and modifying effects of other genes, including evolutionarily conserved components of the caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway.
0.5215762.10491396.html.plaintext.txt	291	 Psn transgenic flies may therefore be a useful genetic tool to dissect Psn function by performing genetic modifier screens for additional factors that interact with presenilin.

0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	6	Received April 23, 1999; Revised and Accepted June 8, 1999.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	7	We previously described a splice donor site mutation in intron 4 of presenilin-1 (PSEN1) in two patients with autopsy-confirmed early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Here we provide evidence that the intron 4 mutation is present in four additional unrelated early-onset AD cases, that the mutation segregates in an autosomal dominant manner and that all cases have one common ancestor.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We demonstrate that the intron 4 mutation produces three different transcripts, two deletion transcripts ([Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic) and one insertion transcript (insTAC), by aberrant splicing.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The deletion transcripts result in the formation of C-truncated (~7 kDa) PSEN1 proteins while the insertion transcript produces a full-length PSEN1 with one extra amino acid (Thr) inserted between codons 113 and 114 (PSEN1 T113-114ins).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The truncated proteins were not detectable in vivo in brain homogenates or lymphoblast lysates of mutation carriers.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In vitro HEK-293 cells overexpressing [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic or insTAC PSEN1 cDNAs showed increased A[beta]42 secretion (~3.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	13	4 times) only for the insertion cDNA construct.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Increased A[beta]42 production was also observed in brain homogenates.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Our data indicate that in the case of intron 4 mutation, the AD pathophysiology results from the presence of the PSEN1 T113-114ins protein comparable with cases carrying dominant PSEN1 missense mutations.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	16	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the major cause of senile dementia.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Mutations in three genes, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1), the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) (2) and the presenilin-2 (PSEN2) genes (3,4), are involved in the etiology of early-onset AD.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The majority of the mutations were found in PSEN1 on chromosome 14 (5).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The PSEN1 gene comprises 13 exons, of which exons 3-12 code for a protein of 467 amino acids (6-8).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Different PSEN1 transcripts were reported resulting from alternative splicing of a 12 bp sequence in exon 3, coding for the amino acids Val Arg Ser Gln (VRSQ) (6,7), and of exon 8 (2).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	21	PSEN1 encodes a serpentine-like protein, located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (9-11).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The PSEN1 protein has six to eight transmembrane (TM) domains with the N-terminus, the large sixth hydrophilic loop (HL-VI) and the C-terminus protruding into the cytoplasm (9,10,12).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	23	 PSEN1 is endoproteolytically processed within the region of HL-VI encoded by exon 9 (13), resulting in the production of an ~28 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) and ~18 kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The endoproteolytic processing is a tightly regulated mechanism in which CTF and NTF accumulate to a saturable level in a 1:1 stoichiometry (13).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The exact biological function of PSEN1 remains unknown.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently, it was suggested that PSEN1 is either directly or indirectly involved in the processing of APP into A[beta]42 (14-17).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This finding corroborates previous observations that mutations in PSEN1 probably cause AD by a gain-of-function mechanism.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	28	 PSEN1 mutations result in increased A[beta]42 secretion in plasma and fibroblasts of mutation carriers (18), in media of transfected cells and in brains of transgenic mice (18-24).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	29	 A[beta]42 is the 42 amino acid form of A[beta] and is believed to be pathogenic since it is more prone to aggregation, accelerating its deposition in brain (25).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	30	 PSEN1 null mice are embryonic lethal and have decreased A[beta]42 formation (26-28).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	31	 PSEN1 mutants rescue the embryonic lethality of PSEN1 null mice with an increase in A[beta]42 secretion (29,30).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Altered APP metabolism with increased A[beta]42 formation is therefore considered an intrinsic property of mutant PSEN1 proteins.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	33	With the exception of the in-frame deletion of exon 9 ([Delta]9) (31-34), all PSEN1 mutations reported are missense mutations (5).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, we recently reported a single nucleotide (G) deletion in the consensus sequence of the splice donor site of intron 4 in two autopsy-confirmed cases with early-onset AD (35).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We demonstrated that this mutation results in abnormally spliced PSEN1 transcripts lacking the entire exon 4 ([Delta]4) or part of exon 4 ([Delta]4cryptic), due to exon skipping or cryptic splicing within exon 4, respectively (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In both deletion transcripts the reading frame is shifted, resulting in a premature stop codon (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Both [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic transcripts with and without the VRSQ were detected in both AD patients, although at much lower abundance than wild-type (WT) PSEN1 mRNA (35).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Based on the truncation site and the location of the premature stop codons, we predicted the formation of a C-truncated PSEN1 protein (+VRSQ) of 70 amino acids for [Delta]4 and 77 for [Delta]4cryptic, corresponding to a peptide of ~7 kDa (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In the absence of knowledge of the biology of the truncated PSEN1 transcripts and/or proteins, we hypothesized that this truncating mutation leads to AD pathology through haploinsufficiency of full-length PSEN1 (35).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Proteins generated by WT PSEN1 (A), PSEN1 [Delta]4 (B), PSEN1 [Delta]4cryptic (C) and insTAC (D) transcripts.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	41	 A 1 bp deletion in the splice donor site of intron 4 (indicated by an asterisk) leads to exon 4 skipping ([Delta]4) (B), cryptic splicing within exon 4 ([Delta]4cryptic ) (C) or cryptic splicing within intron 4 (insTAC ) (D).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The deletion of, respectively, 251 or 169 bp in the [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic transcripts results in a frameshift (undulated) and the introduction of a premature stop codon at, respectively, codon 155 for [Delta]4 or134 for [Delta]4cryptic.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	43	 N-truncated proteins starting at alternative Met codons (AUG) 139 and 210 are indicated.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Cryptic splicing within intron 4 results in the in-frame insertion of 3 bp (TAC), leading to an extra Thr codon (ACA) (black box).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	45	Here we report the observation of the intron 4 mutation in four additional unrelated patients with early-onset AD.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Also, we provide evidence that the mutation segregates in an autosomal dominant manner and most likely has one common ancestor.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Furthermore, we show that the intron 4 mutation gives rise not only to the truncating deletion transcripts ([Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic) but also to an in-frame insertion transcript due to alternative splicing using a cryptic splice site in intron 4 (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In vivo and in vitro analyses of both the deletion and insertion transcripts using cDNA transfection, western blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemcial analyses indicated that the AD pathophysiology in these patients results from increased A[beta]42 secretion by the insertion transcript but not the deletion transcripts.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	49	Initially, we identified the intron 4 mutation in one case (177) with a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	50	 2A) and a second case (142) for which no family history information was available (35; Table 1).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Here we have identified the mutation in an additional four unrelated cases with early-onset AD (Table 1).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Patient 593 belongs to a brain bank of autopsy-confirmed AD cases (A.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	53	 No data on family history were available for patient 593.

0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Later genealogical studies indicated that families F105 and F160 belonged to the same pedigree (F105/160) (Fig.

0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Also, all patients were of British ancestry, suggesting that the intron 4 mutation is a frequent mutation, at least in Great Britain.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Mutation analysis for the intron 4 mutation in a population-based sample of 102 Dutch early-onset AD cases (39) did not detect mutation carriers.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Another possibility is that all mutation carriers are distantly related, sharing a common ancestor.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	203	 This hypothesis was confirmed by analyzing four highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat markers flanking the PSEN1 gene, showing that all patients shared one common allele at each of the markers (Table 1).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Based on the frequencies of the shared alleles and considering each marker independently, the probability of observing this allele combination in six unrelated cases by chance is 10-16.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	205	Based on the observation of the [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic truncated mRNA transcripts in brains of patients carrying the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation, we previously hypothesized that the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation would lead to AD by haploinsufficiency of PSEN1 (35).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, here we report the presence of a third transcript caused by the same mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This transcript is due to the insertion of a TAC triplet between exons 4 and 5 of PSEN1 (insTAC) and results in the insertion of a Thr after amino acid 113 (T113-114ins), located in the first hydrophilic loop (HL-I) of the PSEN1 protein.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	208	 In HL-I, six missense mutations are located in codons 115 (39,42), 117 (43), 120 (44-46) and 123 (47), suggesting that this HL is particularly vulnerable to mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Sequencing of the complete PSEN1 cDNA sequence excluded the presence of other PSEN1 transcripts than [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic and insTAC.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Semi-quantitative fluorescent analysis of the WT and insTAC PSEN1 transcripts indicated that the expression level of the insTAC mutation was ~75% of that of the WT transcript.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	211	 No significant differences were observed between brain and lymphoblast cDNA.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Also, in the same analysis, the [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic deletion transcripts were undetectable.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	213	We generated PSEN1 cDNA constructs corresponding to the [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic and insTAC cDNA transcripts by in vitro mutagenesis of full-length PSEN1 cDNA and transfected them into mammalian cells.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	214	 For the insTAC transcript, we demonstrated the formation of an ~46 kDa protein.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	215	 This ~46 kDa mutant PSEN1 protein was indistinguishable from the WT PSEN1 by the methods we used.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	216	 We failed to raise an antibody which specifically and exclusively recognizes the mutant protein using the synthetic peptide CKDGQLTIYTPF.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	217	 For the [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic truncated transcripts, we showed that the predicted PSEN1 C-truncated peptide of ~7 kDa (PSEN1Ctrunc) is formed, although only in the [Delta]4cryptic transfectants, but is rapidly degraded since it was only detectable after inhibiting the non-lysosomal degradation pathway of the cell.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	218	 This rapid degradation is not unexpected, because PSEN1Ctrunc is a short peptide containing several hydrophilic or charged residues and is not inserted in the membrane.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	219	 PSEN1Ctrunc is therefore not likely to be functionally active.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In addition to PSEN1Ctrunc, N-truncated PSEN1 peptides of ~30 and ~25 kDa (PSEN1Ntrunc) are formed from both [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic cDNA constructs.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	221	 By in vitro mutagenesis and cDNA transfection we demonstrated that PSEN1 N-truncation results from initiation of translation at Met139 (TM-II) and to a lesser extent Met210 (TM-IV).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	222	 For [Delta]4cryptic, Met139 is located downstream of the premature stop codon at codon 134 (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	223	 1), allowing the ribosomes to re-initiate translation at Met139 (or Met210), with the formation of both PSEN1Ctrunc and PSEN1Ntrunc.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Translation re-initiation has been documented before for eukaryotic mRNAs containing premature stop codons (48,49).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	225	 For [Delta]4, however, Met139 is located upstream of the premature stop codon 155 (Fig.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	226	 1), implying that PSEN1Ctrunc and PSEN1Ntrunc cannot be translated from the same transcript in this case.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Only PSEN1Ntrunc, but no PSEN1Ctrunc, was detected in cells expressing [Delta]4 cDNA, suggesting that translation initiation took place at Met139, skipping Met1 completely.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	228	 It is known that ribosomal subunits can bypass Met1 and initiate translation at the next favorable Met codon (50-53) and that, in the case of frameshifted transcripts, these alternative Met codons are preferentially used (54).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Also, in WT PSEN1-expressing cells minor translation products of ~30 and ~25 kDa were detected that potentially correspond to the N-truncated PSEN1 proteins, but in vitro mutagenesis of WT PSEN1 was not performed.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	230	 When WT PSEN1 was transiently overexpressed in CHO cells, the N-truncated PSEN1 peptides were also observed, confirming that Met139 and Met210 are suitable translation initiation codons.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	231	 However, the ~30 and ~25 kDa proteins observed in WT PSEN1-expressing cells are only minor translation products, whereas in [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic transfectants they are the major translation products.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	232	In brain homogenates and lymphoblast lysates of patients with the intron 4 mutation we could not detect the PSEN1Ctrunc or PSEN1Ntrunc proteins.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	233	 However, we cannot exclude that the truncated PSEN1 proteins are formed at concentrations below the detection limit of the methods used.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	234	 On the other hand, if PSEN1Ctrunc is formed it is most likely rapidly degraded through the non-lysosomal pathway, as suggested by our in vitro experiments.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	235	 PSEN1Ntrunc, having, respectively, six and four intact TM domains and potentially being integrated into the membrane, may also be an artifact of the in vitro overexpression system.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	236	Missense PSEN1 mutations are believed to be pathogenic by a gain-of-function in which A[beta]42 secretion is selectively increased (26,29,30).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	237	 To test whether [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic and/or insTAC have a similar effect on A[beta]42 secretion, we measured A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 concentrations in media from [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic and insTAC stable transfectants.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	238	 No significant variations in A[beta]40 were detected between WT and any of the mutant transfectants.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Also, we observed no significant increase in A[beta]42 secretion for [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic when compared to WT PSEN1.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	240	 This result corroborates with the finding that N-truncated PSEN2 proteins, resulting from naturally occurring alternative splicing of PSEN2, do not lead to increased A[beta]42 secretion (55).
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	241	 A significant increase in A[beta]42 secretion was seen, however, for the insTAC transfectants compared with WT PSEN1 transfectants.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	242	 We also compared the increase in A[beta]42 secretion for the insTAC transfectants with the increase in A[beta]42 concentration caused by a missense mutation Y115C located in HL-I, close to the site of the T113-114ins mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	243	 The A[beta]42 increase was comparable, although slightly higher for the missense mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	244	 We also demonstrated an increased A[beta]42:A[beta]40 ratio in the brains of patients carrying the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue of these patients also showed a similar amount and pattern of A[beta]42 deposition in senile plaques as observed in patients carrying PSEN1 missense mutations (A.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the truncated proteins formed during overexpression of the [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic transcripts do not have a biological function in A[beta]42 secretion.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	247	 The PSEN1 T113-114ins formed by the insTAC transcript, however, clearly led to increased A[beta]42 secretion, comparable with PSEN1 missense mutations.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	248	In conclusion, we have provided evidence that the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation is causally related to AD.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Furthermore, we have demonstrated the presence of an extra insertion transcript, insTAC, in the brains and/or lymphoblasts of patients carrying this mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	250	 In vitro analysis of [Delta]4, [Delta]4cryptic and insTAC transfectants suggests that the insTAC transcript is most likely responsible for the AD phenotype in patients carrying the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	251	 The [Delta]4 and [Delta]4cryptic transcripts, on the other hand, are most probably not important contributors to AD pathophysiology.
0.3934777.10401002.html.plaintext.txt	252	 Therefore, the PSEN1 intron 4 mutation does not lead to AD pathology due to haploinsufficiency of PSEN1, but is pathogenic by a similar mechanism to PSEN1 missense mutations, resulting in increased A[beta]42 secretion.
