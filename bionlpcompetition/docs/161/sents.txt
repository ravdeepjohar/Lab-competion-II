0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	5	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We have observed an unusually high prevalence of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) in Wadi Ara, an inbred Arab community in northern Israel comprising 850 persons over the age of 60 years.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Family studies revealed that more than one-third of the DAT cases are members of one hamula (tribal group) within Wadi Ara.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	7	 To map chromosomal loci contributing to DAT susceptibility, we conducted a 10 cM scan in a series of five cases and five controls selected from this hamula.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Markers from 18 chromosomal regions showed significant allelic association with DAT (P < 0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Locations on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 remained significant after testing additional affected and non-demented individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Significant associations were also observed for markers on chromosome 12 which overlap with a locus implicated in previous genome scans.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Analysis of allele frequency distributions for 12 markers spanning 20 cM on chromosome 9 narrowed the possible location of an DAT susceptibility gene to a 13 cM interval between D9S157 and D9S259 (most significant result: P=2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Analysis of 14 markers spanning 24 cM on chromosome 12 narrowed the possible location to a 14 cM interval distal to the LRP1 locus (most significant result: P=1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Evidence for linkage on chromosome 9 stemmed primarily from excess homozygosity of marker alleles in cases compared with controls, suggesting that the gene at this location behaves in either a recessive or additive fashion.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The unique characteristics of this community together with the emergent human genome data should allow for the rapid identification of DAT genes in these candidate regions.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss, language deterioration, impaired visuo-spatial skills and poor judgment, and neuropathologically by extracellular amyloid plaque deposition intra neuronal neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	16	 AD usually begins after age 65 however, its onset may occur as early as age 30.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The early-onset forms of the disease appear to have a strong genetic component, and mutations in several genes have been identified including the amyloid precursor gene (APP; 104760), presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2; 600759).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	18	The basis of the more common, late-onset form of AD is less well understood.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The genetic risk factor with the highest attributable risk for AD is the 4 allele of the APOE gene on chromosome 19q (1).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Among Caucasians, the odds of AD for 4 homozygotes and for 3/4 heterozygotes are 14.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	21	2, respectively, greater than that associated with 3 homozygotes (2).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Many other genes have been studied because of the possible role of their gene products in the disease, or because of their proximity to known AD loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The evidence implicating other susceptibility genes is much less compelling.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Associations have been reported for no fewer than 40 genes (3,4), yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Linkage studies have implicated regions on chromosomes 9 (5), 10 (6 to 8), and 12 (9 to 11).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Candidate genes in these regions include insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) on chromosome 10 and 2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP1) on chromosome 12 (8,12,13), although none has been proven to be an AD gene (14 to 17).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	27	In this report, we examined the genetic basis of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) in a unique community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In a population based study, we screened all residents ages 60 years and older (n=821) of Wadi Ara, an Arab community near Tel-Aviv in northern Israel and observed a prevalence higher than that found in Israel, China, Europe or the USA, even after adjustment for age, education and gender (18,19).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This unusually high prevalence is apparently not due to an increased frequency of the APOE 4 allele, which is actually reduced in this community (0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	30	02 for non-demented elders) as compared with other Caucasians (20).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara is associated with a limited number of unique susceptibility alleles whose frequency was enriched by inbreeding.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The current residents of Wadi Ara are members of 14 hamulas (family groups).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Until recently, there has been minimal immigration or emigration from the community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We designed and carried out an efficient 10 cM genome scan by exploiting the unique population structure.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Results of this study confirm the existence of DAT loci on chromosomes 9, 10 and 12 and provide evidence for a new DAT locus on chromosome 2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	36	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Genome scan The high prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara may, of course, be explained by environmental or genetic factors (or both).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The genetic hypothesis was bolstered by examination of 187 pedigrees showing a smaller number of surnames in those families containing DAT cases than in those without DAT cases.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In fact, more than one-third of the 168 prevalent DAT cases were from one of the 14 hamulas.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Despite the large concentration of DAT cases in this hamula, few individual pedigrees contained more than one living affected member.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Therefore, traditional family-based linkage study approaches were not feasible.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	41	 However, given the high degree of inbreeding in Wadi Ara evidenced by frequent first-cousin and second-cousin marriages, and the limited number of founders, we reasoned that prevalent DAT susceptibility alleles may be identical by descent and, therefore, frequency distributions of alleles or genotypes for markers linked to an DAT locus would differ between DAT cases and controls.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	42	 A 10 cM genome scan was conducted by genotyping 375 markers from the ABI genome scan panel in DNAs from five DAT cases (ages 68 to 85 years) and five non-demented controls (ages 63 to 85 years) from different families in the hamula with the highest disease prevalence.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Markers at 18 linkage regions on 13 different chromosomes showed a significant difference in the allele frequency distribution between DAT cases and controls (Table 1).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In many instances, the difference was not attributable to a specific allele.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	45	 There was no evidence for either excess marker homozygosity in cases compared with controls or association at the genotype level.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Markers showing association with AD in genome wide scan   Follow-up studies Markers whose allele frequency distribution differed significantly (P < 0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	47	05) between the cases and controls were genotyped in an enlarged sample of 100 DAT cases and 110 controls selected from the entire cohort.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Results which remained significant in the enlarged sample were pursued by analysis of additional markers flanking the positive signals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Significant allelic association remained for locations on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 only (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We also genotyped several markers in a region on chromosome 12 implicated in other linkage studies (5,9,10,11), but not in our genome scan, and evidence of allelic association was also found at this location (Fig.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The most significant allelic distribution difference was observed with D2S305 (global P=0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	58	 At the genotype level a more remarkable difference was found with D2S310 located 1 cM away.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	59	 For this marker, 10% of DAT cases but 0% of controls were carriers of the 135 bp allele (P=0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	60	On chromosome 9, significant allelic association was observed with four markers located in the interval between 32 and 45 cM (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The associations with three of these markers (D9S925, D9S9162 and D9S259) were due to over-representation of a specific allele.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Further examination revealed significant excess homozygosity of these marker alleles and a marker allele at D9S171 in DAT cases compared with non-demented subjects (Table 2).

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Evidence for an additive or recessive AD locus on chromosome 9   Taking into account the results from the genome scan and previous linkage studies, we evaluated intensively a 90 cM interval on chromosome 10 (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Although significant allelic associations were observed with markers located in separate linkage groups [e.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	67	004)], the most conservative conclusion is that an DAT susceptibility gene is located in the interval between 105 cM and 115.

0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Concomitant allelic and genotypic association was observed for only two other chromosome 10 markers (D10S1426 and D10S208).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	71	Our genotyping efforts on chromosome 12 focused on the region near and distal to LRP1, which was implicated in linkage and association studies of outbred populations (10,13,22).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Whereas no association was evident among markers within 5 cM of LRP1, six markers between 5 and 20 cM distal to LRP1 were associated with DAT in this population (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Allele 216 at D12S1686 was present in 44% of DAT cases but in only 27% of controls (P=0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Three alleles (256/258/260) at D12S1722 accounted for 14% of DAT chromosomes but were absent in controls (P=1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Allele 216 at D12S326 was significantly over-represented (P=0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	76	0008) in chromosomes of DAT cases (40%) compared with controls (26%).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	77	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   We designed an unconventional 10 cM genome scan to identify loci for DAT in a highly inbred Israeli to Arab community having the highest known prevalence of DAT in the world (18).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The history of this region suggests that the residents of this community were descendants of a small number of founder individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Since then, it has remained a relatively closed society with a high degree of consanguinity.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Because only 10 distantly related individuals (five DAT cases and five non-demented controls) from one extended kindred were genotyped, this approach is both efficient and economical relying, of course, on the assumption that the genes contributing to DAT in Wadi Ara are identical by descent and prevalent among affected members.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The genome scan with 375 microsatellite markers revealed evidence of association (P < 0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	82	05) with 18 locations, however, after testing additional markers in a larger number of people, only association to chromosomes 2, 9 and 10 remained.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	83	Arguably, our strategy for the genome scan has a high false-negative rate because it failed to detect the DAT locus on chromosome 12.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Motivated by linkage findings from previous studies of outbred populations, we genotyped many closely spaced markers in the region adjacent and distal to LRP1 and observed significant association with DAT.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Careful inspection of the results from the genome scan revealed that two of the markers flanking the linked region (D12S83 at 76.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	86	7 cM) failed to show association in the genome scan or the follow up (Fig.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Unfortunately, the genotyping assay for the one marker in this interval (D12S326 at 81.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	88	6 cM) which yielded a very significant result in the follow-up analysis failed in the genome scan, thus accounting for the false-negative result for this locus.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The large number of alleles per locus (Table 3) may have further increased the false-negative rate.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	90	 These observations illustrate a potentially serious limitation of a 10 cM genome scan using few subjects.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Nonetheless, this strategy successfully detected the loci on chromosomes 2, 9 and 10.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Polymorphism characteristics among markers in the regions showing linkage   Results of this study attest to the utility of genetic isolates, including those from this region of the Middle East (23 to 25), for mapping genes responsible for disease susceptibility in outbred Caucasian populations.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Our strategy, evaluating linkage disequilibrium between microsatellite marker alleles and DAT, differs from traditional linkage approaches in genetic isolates in several respects.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	94	 First, we focused our efforts on regions identified by a genome scan including only 10 individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Second, the DAT patients in the current cohort, all purportedly descendants from 14 founder matings, are members of distinct pedigrees.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Gene mapping designs which rely on linkage or family-based association approaches (23 to 25) are thus not suitable for our situation in which relationships between individuals in the sample are distant or unclear.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Third, although the efficacy of linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations for recessive traits was demonstrated by Hastbacka and colleagues (26), the efficacy of this approach has not been proven for complex traits.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Notably, the allele-frequency-dependent homozygosity mapping method, which enabled the localization of a gene for recessive deafness in Bali using only 13 affected individuals (27), does not require evaluation of DNA from parents and is thus perhaps well suited to the Wadi Ara population, however, it is effectively limited to recessive traits.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	99	All four chromosomal regions implicated in this study have been reported previously suggesting that they may be authentic loci rather than chance findings.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	100	 The marker on chromosome 2 showing the most significant association with DAT (D2S305) is located about 6 to 10 cM from two markers showing linkage disequilibrium in the case to control sample from Finland (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	101	 The chromosome 9 location overlaps with peaks observed in two other studies with overlapping data sets (5,29) and the chromosome 10 location with several other studies (7,8,29,30).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	102	 While we detected evidence of association to chromosome 12 in this population, the precise region is 20 to 35 cM distal to the linkage peaks observed by others (9 to 11,22,31).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Thus, it is unclear if the region we identified on chromosome 12 is the same as that reported in other studies.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	104	Because multiple markers were tested on chromosomes 2, 9, 10 and 12, these findings were reconsidered after transforming the P-values for the most significant result at each location to LOD scores, Z.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	105	 According to guidelines for interpreting linkage results (32), the locations on chromosomes 9 and 12 are highly significant (Z=5.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	106	8, respectively) and the chromosome 10 locus is certainly suggestive for linkage (Z=2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The most significant result on chromosome 2 (Z=1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	108	5) falls just below the cutoff of 1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	109	7 proposed for  suggestive linkage ; however, our finding would still be considered significant because it replicates a prior linkage finding (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	110	The identification of multiple loci in a genetic isolate was unexpected.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	111	 One or more of the loci might represent a false-positive result, although as discussed above all four loci correspond to approximate locations identified in studies of other populations.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	112	 A more likely explanation is the unfortunate aggregation of multiple susceptibility loci in a single community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Such heterogeneity is consistent with the remarkably high prevalence of DAT in Wadi Ara (18).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Alternatively, the high prevalence of DAT can be explained by an oligogenic mode of transmission requiring coincident inheritance of susceptibility alleles at multiple loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Discrimination among these hypotheses will require simultaneous examination of marker haplotypes or, preferably, the actual susceptibility alleles from each locus in groups of affected and non-demented individuals.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	116	While Wadi Ara has one of the highest prevalence rates of DAT in the world (18), the very low frequency of the APOE 4 allele in both non-demented individuals (2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	117	6%) indicates that the genetic basis of the disorder in this population is due entirely to other loci (20).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	118	 A low impact of APOE on AD risk has been reported in Yoruba living in Nigeria, but the baseline frequency of 4 is more than 20% and the incidence of AD is low (33,34).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	119	 In contrast, Pericak-Vance and colleagues observed only the APOE 3/3 genotype among AD cases in the Amish, an inbred religious sect (35).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	120	 However, the Amish have a lower prevalence of dementia than Wadi Ara and even most outbred Caucasian populations of European origin.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Non-genetic factors including diet, low levels of education and physical activity may also be partly responsible for the high prevalence of the disease in Wadi Ara (36).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	122	We were surprised by the high degree of marker polymorphism suggesting that there might be a greater degree of admixture with other populations than predicted (see Table 3).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Alternatively, the large number of alleles may be due to the relative instability of microsatellilte markers from generation to generation.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Interestingly, substantial marker polymorphism was also observed in a study of AD in 98 members from a genetic isolate in Finland (28).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In the Finnish study, global tests for allelic association were significant at the 0.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	126	05 level for 21 out of 366 markers tested genome-wide, but two-thirds of these regions were not confirmed by follow-up analysis with additional linked markers.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	127	 The very high proportion of marker heterozygosity, while perhaps enabling the detection of individual marker association, hindered meaningful haplotype analysis because without parental data to establish linkage phase the power for estimating haplotypes in this sample is poor, even with the assistance of maximum likelihood approaches (37).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	128	 A more efficacious strategy for assessing linkage disequilibrium over small intervals defined by haplotypes and, ultimately, for identifying candidate genes, is the evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	129	The results of our study implicate several potential AD genes.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	130	 APOB and ADAM17 are located in the candidate region on chromosome 2.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	131	 APOB is the main apolipoprotein of chylomicrons and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and is important for lipid and cholesterol metabolism.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	132	 ADAM17 is a disintegrin-metalloprotease that is responsible for S2 cleavage of NOTCH1.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	133	 This cleavage makes NOTCH1 susceptible to cleavage by a gamma-secretase-like protease, leading to activation of the notch pathway (38).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This is analogous to the action of presenilins that also act through the notch pathway.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The peak on chromosome 10 between D10S1686 and D10S583 includes several genes previously associated with AD including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) which encodes a membrane protein that synthesizes oxysterol regulators of lipid metabolism (39), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a neutral metalloproteinase and has been shown to degrade beta-amyloid (40), an important protein found in the plaques seen in AD, and urinary plasminogen activator (PLAU), a protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin and is elevated in AD patients (41).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	136	The observation of excess chromosome 9 marker homozygosity among DAT patients is consistent with recessive inheritance.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	137	 All of the known genes for familial early-onset AD (i.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	138	 APP, PS1 and PS2) are expressed in an autosomal dominant fashion, and the effect of APOE 4 the one bona fide gene for late-onset AD on AD risk is additive (2,42).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Although most genetic modeling studies based on data from outbred families have not found evidence for recessive inheritance (43 to 45), a recessive model was not rejected in an analysis of families lacking the APOE 4 allele (46).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Consanguineous populations provide a unique opportunity to discern recessively behaving genes for diseases manifesting in late life.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	141	A potential caveat of this study is the lack of neuropathological evidence for AD in any patient from this community.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Unfortunately, brain autopsy could not be performed because it violates religious customs.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	143	 It is therefore possible that subjects with other dementing illnesses, especially vascular dementia, may have been misclassified as DAT.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, this concern is lessened by corroborating evidence from brain MRI scans performed on a portion of DAT patients (see Methods).
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Diagnostic validity is also supported by the finding of linkage to three regions previously implicated as harboring AD loci.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	146	The identification of chromosomal segments showing association or linkage is only the first step toward discovery of genetic defects that increase susceptibility to AD.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Together with the large amount of gene information available, it is now feasible to systematically identify SNPs in each of the potential candidate genes and evaluate their association with AD.
0.3005403.12566388.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Given the SNP map is considerably more dense than the microsatellite marker map, it is likely the candidate regions can be reduced significantly by haplotype analysis using small blocks of SNPs.

0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Amyloid- peptides (A) are widely presumed to play a causal role in Alzheimer disease.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Release of A from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires proteolysis by the -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Although increased BACE1 activity in Alzheimer disease brains and human (h) BACE1 transgenic (tg) mice results in altered APP cleavage, the contribution of these molecular alterations to neurodegeneration is unclear.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We therefore used the murine Thy1 promoter to express high levels of hBACE1, with or without hAPP, in neurons of tg mice.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Compared with hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP doubly tg mice had increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments (C89, C83) and decreased levels of full-length APP and A.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In contrast to non-tg controls and hAPP mice, hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice showed degeneration of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus and degradation of myelin.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Neurological deficits were also more severe in hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These results demonstrate that high levels of BACE1 activity are sufficient to elicit neurodegeneration and neurological decline in vivo.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This pathogenic pathway involves the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments but does not depend on increased production of human A.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Thus, inhibiting BACE1 may block not only A-dependent but also A-independent pathogenic mechanisms.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	13	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The precise mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD)2 are not completely understood.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	14	 However, diverse lines of evidence suggest that alterations in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the accumulation of amyloid- peptides (A), play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD (1 to 3).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Various products are derived from APP through alternative proteolytic cleavage, and enormous progress has recently been made in identifying the enzymes involved (3 to 11).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	16	Cleavage of APP by -secretase results in the secretion of a large N-terminal ectodomain.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In an alternative pathway, -secretase generates a shorter secreted N-terminal fragment and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) C89 and C99, which remain membrane-bound.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The latter fragments are then further cleaved by -secretase, resulting in the production of A peptides.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) accounts for most of the -secretase activity in the brain (1, 5 to 7, 9).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	20	 BACE1 is a typical aspartic protease; cleavage of the prodomain to generate the mature enzyme occurs at the C-terminal site resulting in the generation of a mature protein starting at Glu-46 (12).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	21	Recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of AD involves alterations in the activity of BACE1.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A polymorphism in the BACE1 gene has been reported to influence AD risk (13).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Compared with nondemented controls, BACE1 immunoreactivity was increased around amyloid plaques in AD brains; levels of BACE1 were elevated in AD brain homogenates (14 to 17) and correlated with the levels of APP CTFs and with A1 to x and A1 to 42 (18).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The potential pathogenic role of increased BACE activity has been investigated in vivo by analyzing the metabolism of APP in human (h) BACE transgenic (tg) mice (19 to 22).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	25	 These studies have shown that expression of hBACE1 at moderate levels in hAPP tg models results in increased generation of hAPP CTFs and A, which in some cases was associated with enhanced amyloid deposition.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have confirmed the importance of hBACE1 in APP processing in vivo.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, the relationship between high levels of hBACE1 activity, APP processing, and neurodegeneration remains to be established.

0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Sections from the brains of 6-month-old mice were immunolabeled with an antibody against MAP2 (mouse monoclonal) and imaged with the LSCM.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	269	 A to D are from the frontal cortex, and F to I are from the hippocampus (Hipp).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	270	 Although neurons and dendrites were well preserved in non-tg controls (A and F), there was evidence for neurodegeneration in hAPP tg (B and G) and hBACE1 tg (C and H) mice.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Neurodegenerative alterations were even more severe in hBACE1/hAPP tg mice (D and I).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	272	 E and J, quantitation of the percent area of the neuropil covered by MAP2-immunoreactive dendrites revealed significant depletion of MAP2-positive neuronal structures in hBACE1 tg lines.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	273	05 versus non-tg controls (Dunnett's t test).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	274	  Increased activity of hBACE1 led to an increase in the levels of APP CTFs in both hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice, consistent with previous observations (19 to 21, 40, 41).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	275	 Moreover, the levels of APP CTFs in different lines of hBACE1 mice were related to the extent of neurological and neuropathological alterations: the highest levels of APP CTFs were found in the most severely impaired line 1.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	276	 Although previous studies (19 to 21, 40, 41) have shown an increase in C99 and C89 and a decrease in C83, in the present study we found that the most significant increase was in levels of C89, whereas C83 levels were decreased.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	277	 This suggests that in our model APP processing may occur preferentially at the ' cleavage site (15, 35).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	278	 Interestingly, despite an overall increase in C99 and C89 in previous studies, levels of C99-p were decreased significantly in hBACE1/hAPP mice, and this decrease in C-99 phosphorylation was more apparent in mice expressing higher levels of hBACE1 (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	279	 Compared with hAPP tg mice, our hBACE1/hAPP mice showed lower levels of C99, and C99-p was decreased with hBACE1 overexpression.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	280	 Because phosphorylation of APP is a post-translational modification necessary for maturation and axonal transport of C99 (42, 43), the decrease in C99-p indicates that APP cleavage in the hBACE1/hAPP mice might occur in early compartments (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	281	High levels of hBACE1 and APP CTFs in our hBACE1/hAPP mice were associated with decreased levels of human A1 to x and A1 to 42, as determined by highly quantitative ELISA measurements.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These results are consistent with a recent study (19) but differ from results obtained in other hBACE1/hAPP models (20, 21, 40, 41).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	283	 Several factors might account for these differences, including the genetic background of the mice analyzed.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	284	 However, the most critical factor in determining the effects of hBACE1 activity might be the levels of hBACE1 transgene expression (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	285	 Although low and intermediate levels of hBACE1 expression enhanced amyloid production and deposition in doubly tg mice, higher levels of hBACE1 expression reduced A production, presumably because high levels of hBACE1 activity shifted the subcellular location of APP cleavage to the neuronal cell body and early secretory pathway, resulting in a depletion of mature APP-p in the trans-Golgi compartment (19).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	286	 Thus, a lesser amount of APP might be targeted to the distal axon, which would preclude -secretase-mediated generation of A at synaptic sites.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	287	If not A, what other factors may result in the degeneration of neurons with high levels of BACE1 activity? Recent evidence suggests that the toxicity of CTFs may be mediated by the caspase-generated C-terminal C31 fragment (44, 45).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	288	 It will therefore be interesting to test whether preventing the generation of C31 prevents neurodegeneration in hBACE1/hAPP mice.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	289	 In a similar vein, expression of hBACE1 in mAPP-deficient mice might reveal APP-independent mechanisms of hBACE1-induced neurotoxicity.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	290	 Conceivably, increased BACE1 activity might trigger neurodegeneration by cleavage of substrates other than APP.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	291	 For example, both in vitro (12) and in vivo (46) BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I, a sialyltransferase whose cleavage product is secreted.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	292	 Recently, it has been shown that BACE1 also cleaves -subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (47).
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	293	 Increased levels of hBACE1 activity could further broaden the substrate specificity of this enzyme in both tg mice and humans with AD.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	294	Indeed, recent studies have identified increased levels of hBACE1 immunoreactivity and of APP CTFs in AD brains (14 to 17), suggesting that increased BACE1 activity may be causally involved also in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	295	 The current study supports and extends this notion by demonstrating that increased neuronal hBACE1 activity can cause progressive neurodegenerative alterations in vivo.
0.21784335.16027115.html.plaintext.txt	296	 Whereas inhibiting -secretase, which does not alter - or -secretase processing, decreases A production but increases the accumulation of APP CTFs (48, 49), inhibiting BACE1 may block both A-dependent and A-independent pathogenic mechanisms in AD.

0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	2	Background Patients with Alzheimer's disease show a wide variation in clinical phenotype.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Genetic research has been largely concerned with the role of mutations or common variants as risk factors for the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Do genetic factors also influence clinical phenotype?.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To examine the evidence that genetic factors influence the clinical expression of the disease in addition to influencing risk.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method A selective review was made of the key literature.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Mutations in three genes, coding for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, and a common variation (4) in another gene, APOE, have been shown to lead to an earlier development of the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	8	 More recently, genetic association and twin studies have suggested a role for genetic factors in the development of other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably the appearance of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions In Alzheimer's disease genetic variation influences a number of aspects of clinical phenotype.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	10	Early family and twin studies have indicated that a number of genes have an important part to play in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Variation in these genes, including both rare mutations and common polymorphisms, appears to confer increased risk for the development of the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, apparent increased risk may be largely explained by the effects that genetic variation has on the clinical phenotype of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the age at which the disease presents.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	13	 More recently, it has been proposed that genetic variation may also explain some of the other features of clinical phenotype, including the development of non-cognitive symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	14	The clearest evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is the existence of families in whom the disease is transmitted in a clear autosomal dominant pattern.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Study of one of these large pedigrees revealed the transmission, from generation to generation, of a single point mutation in the gene for amyloid precursor protein (APP), found on chromosome 21 in family members developing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Further studies of these families led to the discovery of other point mutations in the same gene and later the presence of mutations in two other genes, encoding presenilin-1 (PS-1) and presenilin-2 (PS-2), found on chromosomes 14 and 1, respectively.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	17	 To date, 12 Alzheimer's disease-related mutations have been discovered in the APP gene, 69 mutations in the PS-1 gene and 5 mutations in the PS-2 gene.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Significantly, research suggests that the different mutations in these three genes lead to a common result, an increase in ss-A4 peptide fragment of APP which forms the core of the neuritic plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	19	While these findings are of immense importance in terms of elucidating the biological pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diease, it is important to recognise that these three causal genes may only account for 30-50% of all autosomal dominant early-onset cases, or around 10% of familial early-onset cases (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Thus, given that in the majority of cases ( >  95%) Alzheimer's disease occurs after the age of 60 years, it is clear that these genetic mutations make only a small contribution to the risk of developing the disease in general.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	21	The inheritance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is more complex than that of the early-onset form.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In cross-sectional studies the presence of a positive family history of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a consistent risk factor for subjects with the late-onset form, but a clear autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is rare.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Both twin and family studies suggest a polygenic multifactorial mode of inheritance and as a consequence the elucidation of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease requires different methods from those used in the early-onset disease, with its simple Mendelian patterns of inheritance.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Association studies have so far dominated the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Such studies look for variation in the frequency of an allele in samples of unrelated patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with unrelated control subjects.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	26	 These studies have resulted in a number of candidate genes being proposed as having importance as risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and include associations with variation in genes encoding the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, PS-1 (an intronic mutation not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease), butyrylcholinesterase, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme, 1-antichymotrypsin, the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex, 2-macroglobulin, the low-density lipoprotein-like receptor, the serotonin transporter and interleukin-1.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Typically, interest in these candidates has diminished as independent replication has not been forthcoming, and little evidence now remains for an important role for genetic variation in the VLDL receptor, PS-1 or 1-antichymotrypsin genes in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The other candidate genes still have their advocates and remain hotly disputed.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	29	More recently, the results of a number of linkage studies have become available.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The methods used for linkage studies in complex non-Mendelian diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease are less powerful than those used for the early-onset form.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	31	 However, such studies can reveal areas of interest in the genome that might later be explored by association studies.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A complete genomic screen in a series of multiplex families affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has revealed five regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, 12, 19 and 20.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Excluding the effects of the APOE4 locus, the maximum log likelihood ratio (lod) score in this study occurred in a region located on the short arm of chromosome 12 (Pericak-Vance et al, 1997).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	34	 However, two subsequent studies following similar methods (Blacker et al, 1998; Wu et al, 1998) were unable to confirm linkage to this area.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A large sibpair study (Kehoe et al, 1999) has revealed many possible loci showing linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These include loci on chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19 (close to APOE) and 21 (close to the APP gene).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently, the main focus of attention is chromosome 10, with two independent studies showing evidence of a susceptibility locus in the same region (Ertekin-Taner et al, 2000; Myers et al, 2000).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	38	 However, it is clear that a large number of loci are implicated and that there is some disagreement between studies in the predicted areas of interest.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	39	 These findings demonstrate some of the limitations of this approach, but also serve to emphasise the polygenic nature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further exploration of these areas by association studies   the positional candidate approach   is likely to dominate the genetics of Alzheimer's disease in the future.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	41	Of the genetic risk factors that have been advocated as having a role in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the least controversial remains the increased risk associated with possession of one or more copies of the APOE4 allele, coding for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variant 4.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Significantly, the importance of APOE4 was determined using a positional candidate gene approach.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Since this finding, other studies (Artiga et al, 1998; Bullido et al, 1998; Lambert et al, 1998) have also suggested an association between a number of polymorphisms within the transcriptional regulatory region of the APOE gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease that is independent of ApoE 4 status.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Based on these data, it was suggested that there are two independent mechanisms by which risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be modified by the APOE gene: first, by variations in the coding regions, which alter the functional properties of APOE; and second, by the presence of promoter variants which result in quantitative differences in APOE expression (Artiga et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, this hypothesis is controversial, and more recent studies (Helisalmi et al, 1999; Zurutuza et al, 2000) have failed to support the independence of APOE promoter variants in the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	46	GENETIC INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL PHENOTYPE.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	47	Age of onset Families carrying mutations in the APP gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-65 years.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	48	 To date, no APP mutation carrier has been reported to be unaffected beyond the age of 67 years.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-1 gene have the earliest ages of onset, which fall largely within the range 35-55 years, although one such family member has recently been recorded with onset at 24 years (Wisniewski et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	50	 These mutations are largely associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but at least two of these mutations (Ala79Val and His163Tyr) have been observed with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and may be non-penetrant (Cruts et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Families carrying mutations in the PS-2 gene have ages of onset largely within the range 40-70 years and thus show some overlap with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Penetrance is high but may not be 100%, with at least two reported cases of non-penetrance over the age of 80 years (Bird et al, 1996).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	53	The familial influence on age of onset in late-onset Alzheimer's disease may be substantial.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, one study of affected sib pairs suggests that shared familial effects may account for 40% of the variance (Tunstall et al, 2000).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Indeed, studies have shown that in the late-onset disease the age of onset is approximately 6 years earlier in individuals who carry two copies of the APOE4 allele compared with non-carriers.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	56	 This has led to the suggestion that the APOE4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease mainly because in old age Alzheimer's disease and death are competing risks.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Any factor leading to an earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly (and hence the development of the disease prior to death) will be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Evidence confirming this hypothesis has come from a large study of approximately 5000 individuals (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This study showed a clear decline in relative risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease in all subjects with increasing age but with a clear plateau beyond which no further new cases of the disease were reported.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The age at which this plateau was reached was earlier in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Thus, it appears clear that the APOE4 allele has its predominant effect by determining when, but not if, an individual develops late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	62	Non-cognitive features If genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are associated with non-cognitive symptoms, then one might anticipate that subjects with a family history of the disease have an increased frequency of these symptoms.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Likewise, one would expect an association between known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, including the genes for APP, PS-1, PS-2 and the ApoE 4 allele, and these symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	64	In fact, there appears to be little consistent evidence of an association between either a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease or variation in known candidate genes and an increase in the frequency of non-cognitive symptoms occurring for the first time within the disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It thus seems unlikely that major genetic risk factors for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have a substantial role to play in the development of non-cognitive symptoms within the late-onset disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, this does not mean that these symptoms have no genetic basis, since genes may influence the phenotypic expression of the disease without being involved directly in its aetiology.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Indeed, early studies have shown evidence of an association between a positive family history of depressive illness and an increase in the frequency of depressive symptoms occurring for the first time within Alzheimer's disease (Pearlson et al, 1990).
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These early findings are supported by a sib-pair study (Tunstall et al, 2000) showing that familial factors have a role in the development of depressive illness in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	69	 In addition, this small study also suggests a role for familial factors in a wide variety of non-cognitive symptoms, including agitation, aggression and psychosis.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	70	A more direct approach has also been adopted whereby common genetic polymorphisms previously showing associations with other neuropsychiatric conditions have been found to be associated with non-cognitive symptoms in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	71	 For example, one study (Holmes et al, 1998) of people with late-onset Alzheimer's disease found an association between common polymorphic variations in the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor genes (102-T/C and Cys23Ser polymorphisms, respectively), previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Associations were found between the presence of the C102 allele and the presence of visual and auditory hallucinations and between the presence of the Ser23 allele and visual hallucinations.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Another study (Sweet et al, 1998) has found evidence to suggest an association of psychosis and aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease who carry common polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor genes DRD1 and DRD3.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These studies need to be replicated but they suggest that common receptor polymorphisms may have a role in the genesis of psychotic or other non-cognitive symptoms that are not implicated as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	75	Cognitive decline No study to date has looked at rates of decline in carriers of APP, PS-1 and PS-2 mutations, but patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease who have a positive family history of Alzheimer's disease show no evidence of increased rates of decline.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	76	 The majority of studies have also failed to show any relationships between possession of the APOE4 allele and increased rates of decline.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This lack of association is interesting since it implies that genetic factors may determine only when the disease starts, not the rate of degeneration.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Clearly, caution is required when interpreting a negative finding and it may be that associations will always be difficult to establish because of the large number of confounding factors which may influence cognitive deterioration as well as difficulties with the use of psychometric scales over short periods.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Indeed, a study by Craft et al (1998) has suggested that there is an increased rate of cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers, which may be detectable by using a long follow-up period.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	80	Duration The mean duration of illness in families with PS-1 mutations is significantly shorter (range 5.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	81	8 years) than in families with both PS-2 (range 4.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	82	8 years) and APP mutations (range 9.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	83	0-16 years), reflecting the severity of PS-1-associated Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease suggest that the duration of illness tends to be longer in people who have a positive family history or in carriers of the APOE4 allele.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	85	 However, it has since been shown that this relationship no longer holds true once the confounding effects of age of onset have been taken into account.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, increased survival is more directly related to an earlier age of onset, which is influenced by a number of factors that are not exclusively genetic.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	87	Clinical Implications and Limitations.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	88	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A number of genes have been implicated as risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Variation in some of these genes appears to have a major effect in determining when   not if   the disease will develop.
0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Other aspects of clinical phenotype, notably non-cognitive symptoms, are also influenced by genetic variation.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	4	Background Alzheimer's disease management involves symptomatic drug treatments passed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Disease modification is now the goal.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	6	Aims To review current and developmental drugs for Alzheimer's disease, their usage, and the clinical context of known facts and proposed specific models.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	7	Method A brief evidence-based review was made, using literature where available, or evidence from consensus groups where it was absent.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	8	Results There is good evidence to support the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, and perhaps vitamin E.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Oestrogen and anti-inflammatory agents show possibility, but there is not enough evidence to support routine use.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	10	Conclusions Symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Observational studies and increasing knowledge of brain biology are leading towards further treatment options.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Old age psychiatrists have valuable treatments they now have to learn to use.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	13	The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Davies  and  Maloney, 1976) has led to the development of a number of strategies to enhance the failing cholinergic neurons and thus the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The most consistent therapeutic effect has been seen using inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which cleaves the transmitter in the cholinergic synapse.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Three such compounds have now been licensed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These have increased awareness of Alzheimer's disease, but unfortunately cost pressures have hindered their development in the UK, even though experienced users of donepezil and rivastigmine have found consistent results (Cameron et al, 2000; Evans et al, 2000; Matthews et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) were considered to be a stepping-stone to better disease-modifying compounds (Bullock, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although they undoubtedly are, no other class of drug has yet reached the clinic, and AChEIs will remain the main treatment option for some time.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A variety of protocols for treatment (Harvey, 1999) have been superseded in the UK by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (2001) guidelines on the use of these three drugs.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	21	The AChEI class of drugs all affect the measured domains of dementia in much the same way.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The consistency of effect is evident from Fig.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	23	 1, which shows the cognition scores averaged from the pivotal trials of the three licensed compounds.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This is a symptomatic response lasting approximately 8 months, followed by a decline that remains significantly above that of the placebo group for longer periods.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	25	 This supports the preclinical cholinergic hypotheses (Davies  and  Maloney, 1976).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Exciting as this is, it is only symptomatic treatment at the end of a complex disease process   analogous to the use of levodopa in Parkinson's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The AChEI class continues to present practical and scientific challenges that clinicians need to have resolved; meanwhile, different treatments continue in development.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	32	Who? In all trials of AChEIs, a  response , as measured by the scales used, was found in an average of 40% of the patients studied (Corey-Bloom et al, 1998; Rogers et al, 1998; Raskind et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This compares favourably with most drugs for chronic illness, and all AChEIs have low  numbers needed to treat  (NNTs) (Livingston  and  Katona, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Using the scores from published data, donepezil has an NNT of 4, rivastigmine 7 and galantamine 3.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The high placebo response is often questioned, but this is common in mental health studies, where it masks a large non-drug treatment effect.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Responders and non-responders are identified   but our criteria may be too harsh and the nature of a  response  needs more research and definition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Currently no hard predictor of response or non-response has been identified (Schneider  and  Farlow, 1995).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The APOE4 allele was once suggested as a marker of poor response, but subsequent studies suggested no correlation.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	39	In the absence of valid biological markers for Alzheimer's disease, measuring the effect intervention may have on the disease itself requires all patients to be treated for a reasonable length of time   perhaps up to 6 months.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	40	 In reality, this depends on economics; so UK prescribers tend to work in subsets of mild to moderate dementia, excluding institutional patients with more advanced disease, and only prescribing to community-based patients who can have their medication supervised   as now ratified in the NICE guidelines.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	41	How? Various models of prescribing exist, all involving titration of the dose to minimise side-effects   particularly gastrointestinal ones.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Donepezil has the advantage of having only two dose steps, while rivastigmine and galantamine offer a wider range, making tailoring to individual patients perhaps more precise.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Whichever drug is chosen, the dose should be taken to the maximum tolerated (within the licence), after which at least 3 months of treatment should be given before considering whether there has been inadequate response.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Rigidity may mean that late responders miss out on potential benefit   but within a limited budget, it will allow more patients exposure to treatment.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	45	If one drug does not work or has intolerable side-effects, then another should be tried; although the three drugs belong to the same class, they are all different.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	46	 There is no published information on switching the drugs.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Convention when switching drugs is to leave an interval of five times the half-life of the first drug before commencing the second (that is, 60 hours for rivastigmine and 15 days for donepezil).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Consensus suggests that 3 days should be left after treatment with rivastigmine or galantamine, while a week should be left following donepezil treatment.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	49	 This is based on clinical practice   no controlled trial has been published.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	50	Which? The three drugs are similar yet have different individual characteristics (Table 1).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	51	 How clinically relevant the differences are is unproven but interesting hypotheses are arising out of them.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	52	View this table:    Table 1 Attributes of the three licensed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  .
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	53	Donepezil Donepezil is very selective for acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	54	 This selectivity is claimed to reduce its side-effect profile, but published clinical data have not shown increased tolerability.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Paradoxically, in Alzheimer's disease the level of AChE falls as the disease progresses (Arendt, 1992), matched by a rise in butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)   the function of which is unknown, but it forms part of the plaques and appears to come from the activated glial cells.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	56	 What BuChE inhibition means is unclear, but rivastigmine and galantamine inhibit it, donepezil does not   they may work differently in later disease, although no published evidence has supported this.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	57	Rivastigmine Rivastigmine preferentially inhibits one of the four AChE subtypes   G1, found particularly in the hypothalamus and cortex.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This subtype is implicated in plaque maturation, but whether there is any added clinical benefit to this specificity is again unproven.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	59	Galantamine Galantamine produces an effect on presynaptic nicotinic receptors called allosteric modulation (as does physostigmine and codeine).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This produces increased amounts of acetylcholine in the synapse by a direct effect on presynaptic release, but again, the clinical impact is unknown and published evidence as to its significance and desirability is required.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It may be that modulation, rather than agonism, protects against downregulation of post-synaptic receptors.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	62	 This may allow the drug to work longer, but further studies are needed to confirm this.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Modulation also improves attention, and this has been demonstrated with galantamine but not with donepezil or rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	64	When? The drugs are licensed for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Patients with mild disease already have significant illness and should receive treatment, even with minimal symptoms.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Treating mildly affected patients will mean smaller responses, and protocols should reflect this   long-term follow-up being needed to show any continuing effect beyond that expected from clinical trials.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Moderate disease covers a wide range of morbidity: in trials down to a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al, 1975) score of 10, but in NICE guidelines down to 12.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Patients scoring at the lower end of the range have a host of symptoms, and AChEIs here may be as valuable for their symptomatic effects on behaviour as for their effect on the underlying disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Trial data with metrifonate (another AChEI, which was withdrawn because of side-effects) showed improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease   especially in apathy, hallucinations and agitation (Cummings et al, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	70	 This effect is more noticeable in dementia with Lewy bodies where improvements in both MMSE scores and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been demonstrated with rivastigmine (McKeith et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	71	 This suggests that dementia should be treated at any time, with symptomatic delay and retention of qualify of life being the aim early in the disease, moving towards symptomatic relief as progression occurs.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	72	 No published results are available for severe dementia, though open-label follow-up from trials suggests that these drugs continue working as the cholinergic deficit increases.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	73	What? What about AChEIs in other dementias, plus other cholinergic therapies? Clinical trials are ongoing with AChEIs in vascular dementia and mixed dementia.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	74	 No result is available as yet, but as the cholinergic system is implicated in these disorders it is hoped that findings will be positive.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A study of rivastigmine in dementia with Lewy bodies has produced positive results (McKeith et al, 2000).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Acetylcholinesterases are being studied as a potential treatment in mild cognitive impairment   a rational assumption as 55% of patients with this problem go on to develop Alzheimer's disease, and intervention here may have a profound effect on the burden of disease overall.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	77	 No study of anticholinergic therapy in frontotemporal dementia is under way at present.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	78	Muscarinic agonists have been tried in Alzheimer's disease, but these drugs have a narrow therapeutic window before side-effects become intolerable, and to date no clinical trial has shown significant effects on cognition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Nicotinic drugs are also still in early trial stages, with similar tolerability problems to overcome, but more promising efficacy data.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	80	Research into Alzheimer's disease has led to understanding of some of the pathological mechanisms involved.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Inflammation occurs, as evidenced by the inflammatory markers found   for example, complement attack complex at levels similar to those found in ischaemic heart disease (McGeer  and  McGeer, 1998).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Basic science coupled with the observation that sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis have a lower rate of Alzheimer's disease (Stewart et al, 1997) has led to trials of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Trials with prednisolone have not been successful, but ongoing work with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (especially Cox-2) in animal and now in human clinical trials may show benefit.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	84	 These drugs are not without long-term side-effects, so current practice is not to recommend their use routinely.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	85	Another observational study has shown that women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have a reduced rate of Alzheimer's disease (Robinson et al, 1994).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The protective effect of oestrogen on the nervous system and its vasculature is well-documented (Birge, 1997), so clinical trials are now in progress to test the efficacy of oestrogen therapy (17-oestradiol particularly).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Early treatment study results are not encouraging (Mulnard et al, 2000), so again, in the absence of published positive studies, HRT cannot be recommended for use as a treatment in Alzheimer's disease   although it does seem that its use is increasing in Alzheimer's disease prophylaxis, particularly in the USA.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	88	Antioxidants have shown benefit in several areas of chronic ill health, including Alzheimer's disease, after a study of selegiline and vitamin E and their effect on disease progression (Sano et al, 1997).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This showed a positive effect on the rate of increasing dependency and delayed institutionalisation.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	90	 However, this has yet to be replicated.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Vitamin E is inexpensive and relatively safe   the trial was high dosage (2000 IU).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Institutionalisation is expensive, so the return on this treatment is potentially high   but not rigorously proven.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Many clinics are now routinely suggesting the use of vitamin E to patients with Alzheimer's disease   usually at about 1000 IU.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It is possible that this may benefit other dementias and neurodegenerative disease as well.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	95	Nootropic drugs are available for prescription in Germany   the best-known being Gingko biloba extract, nicergoline and piracetam.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Precise modes of action are unclear, yet they do seem to produce an effect in some well-controlled studies.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	97	Glutamate is increasingly implicated in dementia pathogenesis, with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) blockade a putative therapy.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Memantine, an NMDA blocker, has had positive results reported in severe Alzheimer's disease (e.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Winblad  and  Poritis, 1999), leading to application for regulatory approval for its use in dementia.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	100	Nerve cell destruction seems secondary to activation of glial cells, so stabilisation of these glial cells may reduce the rate of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Several compounds such as propentofylline purportedly have this effect, especially in vitro, but to date have shown no therapeutic effect clinically.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It remains a potential area of research.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	103	The cortical cholinergic system is diffusely spread and a long way from its cell bodies.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	104	 It is therefore dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) to sustain it, and a reduction in NGF may be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Studies injecting NGF by cannulae into the cerebrospinal fluid showed some effect, but this is not a practical solution.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Attempts to formulate the active portion of NGF into an oral preparation that crosses the blood brain barrier are ongoing; meanwhile a xanthine derivative (leteprinim potassium) that seems to have a stimulating effect on NGF is about to start clinical trial.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	107	The pathological basis of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Most work has focused on the amyloid cascade that produces the plaques, and various drugs are in development to modify amyloid metabolism.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The most imminent clinical trial is the injection of beta-amyloid protein to  vaccinate  the individual and produce an antibody response that might remove amyloid from the nervous tissue.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In mice this procedure relieved symptoms in genetic Alzheimer's disease animal models (Schenk et al, 1999) and prevented plaque formation in younger mice.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This method is being tried in humans in both the UK and the USA, and represents the first true attempt at disease modification.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	112	The other classical pathological change is the development of tangles, made up of abnormal tau protein.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Tau pathology is known to exist in other neurodegenerative conditions and is an important area of research in treating other dementing diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The hyperphosphorylation that occurs in Alzheimer's disease may be amenable to therapeutic intervention, and while there are some experimental models now to support this, no drugs are in clinical trials as yet.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	115	Basic science research is gradually unlocking some of the pathological sequences in dementia (especially in Alzheimer's disease) to provide theoretical treatment opportunities.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	116	 This began with the AChEIs and is now at the stage of amyloid modification.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	117	 For the first time therapeutic options exist in Alzheimer's disease and will soon be available in other dementias.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These may be as simple as using vitamin E, through to combinations of therapy to maximise benefit (Table 2).
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Although these treatments are still predominantly symptomatic, they offer relief to patients and have increased clinicians' awareness of the condition.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This has taken old age psychiatry from its roots in social psychiatry to a point at which psychopharmacology has an important role.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	121	 The challenge now is to learn how to use these treatments most effectively.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This means that everyone in the speciality who uses these treatments has the opportunity to contribute to the debate, and the prospects of development over the next 10 years make this one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of medicine in which to work.

0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Services will need to move towards the diagnosis of early, mild dementia rather than intervene at the moderate to severe stages.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	128	LIMITATIONS Funding of these new drugs may be hard to obtain, especially in areas where basic service needs are unmet and require attention first.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	129	 These are only symptomatic treatments   we now need drugs that change the course of the illness.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	130	 No single therapy is likely to be the solution to Alzheimer's disease.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	131	 We need to learn how best to use cholinesterase inhibitors, and then how to combine them with new drugs as they arrive.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	132	 It will be a while before this can be initiated at the level of primary care.
0.32454574.11823323.html.plaintext.txt	133	The author thanks colleagues who have used these drugs to date for their participation in various consensus groups in order to fill in the gaps in this review where evidence remains weak.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A total of 25 case-control and cohort studies that reported an odds ratio/relative risk were included.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Study-specific log relative risks were weighted by the inverse of their variances to obtain pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The authors divided the reports into studies with prevalent dementia cases, studies with incident dementia cases, and studies where cognitive decline was used as the clinical endpoint.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The pooled relative risks of the three groups of studies were 0.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Because the benefit of NSAIDs in preventing dementia or cognitive impairment was 50% in studies with prevalent dementia cases, declined to 20% in studies with incident dementia cases, and was absent in studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint, the authors conclude that most of the reported beneficial effects of NSAIDs may result from various forms of bias: recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Many observational studies have investigated the association between use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of Alzheimer s disease, dementia, and cognitive decline (1 to 30).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Studies differed greatly in design, population, and exposure.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Many found an inverse association while others found no association.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	17	 More recently, the results of a number of secondary prevention studies have been reported.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Most of them showed no beneficial effect of use of NSAIDs on cognitive function (31 to 33).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Results of primary prevention trials are not available.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Hence, whether NSAIDs truly have a favorable effect in preventing dementia remains controversial (34).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarize the epidemiologic evidence on the association between use of NSAIDs and the risk of dementia and to identify possible sources of heterogeneity between studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	22	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Systematic search We started by using a widely quoted 1996 review on NSAIDs and risk of Alzheimer s disease (35) in two ways: 1) we evaluated the articles that were included in that review and 2) we used the Science Citation Index to identify studies that cited that review.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Next, we searched the MEDLINE database using the search term "NSAID" combined with "Alzheimer s disease," "dementia," or "cognitive decline," limited to studies in humans.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	24	 We did not apply any language restriction.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Titles and abstracts of both search strategies were independently examined for eligibility by two of us (A.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In case of doubt, the full article was retrieved and eligibility was discussed.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Both original articles and reviews were retrieved.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This whole process was repeated for references from identified studies and reviews.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	29	Eligibility criteria and data collection Studies were eligible for inclusion if they satisfied the following three criteria: 1) case-control or cohort study in humans, 2) exposure defined as use of NSAID, and 3) cases defined as Alzheimer s disease, dementia, or cognitive impairment.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	30	Data were independently extracted from each study by two reviewers (A.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	31	 We recorded study design, characteristics of exposure, definitions of cases and controls, prevalent or incident case ascertainment, total number of cases in the exposed group and total number of cases in the unexposed group, the measure of association (odds ratio, relative risk, or hazard ratio), the magnitude of the association with its corresponding 95 percent confidence interval, and the variables adjusted for in the analysis.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	32	 When separate results were reported within one study for both Alzheimer s disease and dementia, the results for dementia were recorded.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	33	 When varying levels of NSAID use were reported, we took the results for the largest group of NSAID users.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	34	Statistical analysis Results of cohort studies were typically expressed as relative risk or hazard ratio, while results of case-control studies were usually expressed as odds ratio.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A hazard ratio is the ratio of instantaneous probability of the outcome event (Alzheimer s disease, dementia, or cognitive decline) in the exposed group compared with that in the nonexposed group and can be considered a relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Because dementia is a rare event ( < 5 percent), odds ratios from case-control studies are also good estimates for the relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	37	 For simplicity, we refer to relative risk for all three types of measures of association.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The logarithm of the relative risk with its corresponding standard error, taken directly from the studies or calculated from the reported 95 percent confidence interval, provided the data points for the meta-analysis.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We used the DerSimonian and Laird (36) random effects model to compute pooled relative risks and to assess statistical heterogeneity.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We did not exclude outliers simply on the basis of the statistical test, because heterogeneity is expected in a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies, but we searched for the sources (i.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out when appropriate.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We evaluated publication bias by means of visual inspection of funnel plots and formal statistical testing (37).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	43	 In a funnel plot, the relative risk of the study is displayed against the weight of the study, which is the inverse of the square of the standard error.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Funnel plots generally show a peak.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This is the point where the studies with smaller standard errors are found and usually represents the point of the approximate true effect.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Formal statistical assessment of funnel plot asymmetry was done with linear regression analysis, where the log odds ratio divided by its standard error was regressed against the inverse of the standard error (37).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Reported p values are from the intercept of the regression analysis, which provides a measure of asymmetry.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies were classified as studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Studies where cognition was the main outcome of interest among users and nonusers of NSAIDs were classified as studies with cognitive decline cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	50	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Searching the Science Citation Index yielded 402 publications referring to the review of McGeer et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	51	 (35), and the MEDLINE search yielded 337 publications.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	52	 After retrieval of potential articles and subsequent discussion, we found 30 studies meeting our eligibility criteria (1 to 30).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Four studies (1 to 4) were excluded because a relative risk could not be extracted from the report (one study did not report on the association (1), two studies found no association (2, 3), and one study compared the cognitive function of patients who had Alzheimer s disease and were taking NSAIDs with that of patients who had Alzheimer s disease and were not taking NSAIDs (4)), and one study (5) was excluded because it was based on the same data as another publication.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Descriptive details of the remaining 25 studies included in our meta-analysis are presented in table 1.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Eleven studies used prevalent cases (6 to 16), 10 studies used incident cases (17 to 26), and four studies used cognitive decline as clinical outcome (27 to 30).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Both the definition and length of exposure of use of NSAIDs varied among studies.

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	78	 All trials included patients with Alzheimer s disease or patients with probable Alzheimer s disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	79	 None of the trials showed a statistically significant reduction in cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Summary results of placebo controlled trials of the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in Alzheimer s disease      DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The results of our study indicate that the benefit of NSAIDs in preventing dementia and cognitive impairment was 50 percent in studies with prevalent dementia cases, declined to 20 percent in studies with incident dementia cases, and was absent in studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	81	There are at least three forms of bias that could explain why the benefit from NSAIDs was larger in studies with prevalent cases than in studies with incident cases: recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	82	 First, subjects from studies with prevalent cases have impaired memory at the time of study, which makes data collection between cases and controls likely to be different, resulting in recall bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Second, prescription bias occurs more frequently in studies with prevalent cases because demented patients have a reduced perception of pain (38, 39), possibly leading to a reduced use of NSAIDs.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Moreover, because of the adverse effects of NSAIDs, physicians might be less inclined to prescribe NSAIDs to demented subjects.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Hence, in the studies with prevalent cases, the reduced intake of NSAIDs might be more the consequence of the dementia than the cause.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Third, it is apparent from the funnel plot that the studies with prevalent cases are more heterogeneous and more skewed to the left than the follow-up studies, resulting in larger pooled estimates of benefit of NSAID use in these studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	87	We found no difference in relative risk between the case-control studies with incident dementia cases and cohort studies, although the potential for recall bias in case-control studies is theoretically higher.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, a total number of 10 studies to investigate the presence of recall bias is rather small.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Therefore, the interpretation of the absence of a significant difference between the two types of design with incident dementia cases should be interpreted with caution.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	90	There were 10 studies with incident cases of dementia.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Within these 10 studies, there were four case-control studies with incident dementia cases and six cohort studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Both types of study gave a similar pooled estimate of relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	93	 If recall bias was a major form of bias, the relative risk of the case-control studies should have been smaller.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	94	 However, because of the wide confidence intervals around both estimates (because of the small number of studies), it is difficult to ascertain whether the studies truly had equal estimates.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	95	There was a significant association between NSAID use and studies with incident cases of dementia, while there was no significant association in studies where cognitive decline was used as the outcome.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Prescription bias might also be the cause of this difference.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Incident subjects with cognitive decline will be relatively free from cognitive dysfunction at baseline, while incident cases with dementia are in a relatively later stage of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In the earlier stages of the disease, prescription bias might not be present.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	99	 To explore whether prescription bias is the cause of the observed association between NSAID use and Alzheimer s disease or whether there is a true beneficial effect, we decided upon randomized clinical trials whose patients were without early signs of Alzheimer s disease (40).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	100	If the period between NSAID use and disease onset is relatively short, then it is difficult to differentiate between cause and effect.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	101	 With a short period between exposure and outcome, reduced intake of NSAIDs among subjects with dementia could also be the consequence of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Four studies (14, 16, 20, 26) tried to avoid this bias by evaluating the use of acetaminophen, to control for differing patterns of drug use between demented and nondemented subjects.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Many authors argued that, because the demented and nondemented subjects did not differ in their acetaminophen use but did vary in their NSAID use, NSAIDs must be associated with better cognitive function.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We think, however, that, in demented patients who might report less pain than nondemented subjects, NSAIDs are the first drugs to be prescribed less frequently.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This means that studies with prevalent cases are more likely to suffer from prescription bias than studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	106	Because Alzheimer s disease, the most common dementia, has an insidious onset, it is also important to know what the different studies used as the index date.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	107	 All studies with prevalent cases took the date of diagnosis of dementia, while three studies with incident dementia cases took the date of first symptoms of disease (17, 21, 24), and seven studies with incident dementia cases used the date of diagnosis of dementia.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The three studies where the date of onset of symptoms was used had similar relative risk estimates as the seven studies where the date of diagnosis was used.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	109	Some publications used in this meta-analysis originate from one cohort.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For example, the Canadian Study of Health and Aging and the Rotterdam Study both contributed two publications.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	111	 However, in both cases, one publication addressed the association in the prevalent dementia cases and the other publication addressed the association in the incident dementia cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Hence, we decided to include both articles in our analyses.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Moreover, the study named Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly consists of four cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	114	 In our analyses, we used estimates reported from the separate cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The study reported by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	116	 (27) uses data from the Iowa cohort, while Hanlon et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	117	 (28) use data from the Duke cohort.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	118	 The study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	119	 (5) uses data from the East Boston, Massachusetts, New Haven, Connecticut, and Iowa cohorts.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In discussing their results, Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	121	 indicate that the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	122	 is "substantially different in measure of cognitive functioning and analytical approach, .
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	123	 making comparability between that study and our study problematic" (5, p.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Including the study by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	125	 in our analyses would have overweighted the data of the Iowa cohort in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	126	 We could have chosen to include the study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	127	 in our analyses instead of the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This would have resulted in a lower pooled relative risk.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	129	 However, including the study reported by Rozzini et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	130	 instead of the study by Saag et al.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	131	 does not affect our interpretation of the data.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	132	The five studies that used cognitive decline as the endpoint all used different cognitive measures.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Hence, we cannot exclude that NSAIDs might have a beneficial effect on a specific cognitive domain.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	134	 However, on average, the effect of use of NSAIDs on cognitive decline is null, which is consistent with the finding that most randomized trials so far have shown: no beneficial effect on the course of dementia as measured with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Moreover, the two studies that were excluded from our meta-analysis (2, 3) because a relative risk could not be extracted both showed no association between use of NSAID and cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	136	A recent meta-analysis of NSAIDs and risk of dementia concluded, "NSAIDs offer some protection against the development of Alzheimer s disease" (41, p.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	137	 This conclusion was based mainly on the observation that short-term users ( < 1 month) had far less risk reduction than long-term users ( > 24 months) (relative risk = 0.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	138	 These authors did not address possible confounding factors (42), nor did they explain the discrepancy between the studies with prevalent cases and the studies with incident cases.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Again, the discrepancy in risk reduction between short-term and long-term users can well be explained by recall bias and prescription bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	140	 By including studies with cognitive decline as the endpoint and thereby creating more distance between exposure and effect, we now demonstrate that bias and confounding are more likely explanations for the observed association.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	141	Traditional teaching holds Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia as two separate clinical entities that can be differentiated by careful clinical and necropsy evaluation.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Several recent observations, however, suggest that the situation might be different.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Vascular risk factors also contribute to Alzheimer s disease (43) and, conversely, ss-amyloid depositions are also frequently found in subjects with vascular dementia (44).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Hence, it is likely that Alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia are two extreme expressions of one disease entity, dementia (45).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	145	 A prominent feature of both disease entities is progressive cognitive decline.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Hence, combining and comparing the various endpoints in one analysis gives a good indication for the possible benefits of NSAIDs in the various stages of the disease.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	147	Until now, most randomized clinical trials have found no beneficial effect of NSAIDs in preventing cognitive decline (31 to 33).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	148	 There might be three explanations for these negative studies.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	149	 First, there is no protective effect of NSAIDs.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Second, most of these studies were carried out in subjects with early signs of cognitive impairment.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Administration of antiinflammatory drugs at that point in the disease process might simply be too late.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Third, it has recently been demonstrated that various NSAIDs have differential propensities on the inflammatory response and deposition of ss-amyloid (46).
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This finding calls for identification of the critical pathways in the inflammatory response and the corresponding drugs that are capable of interfering in that pathway.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	154	In conclusion, the benefit of NSAIDs in preventing dementia or cognitive impairment was 50 percent in studies with prevalent dementia cases, declined to 20 percent in studies with incident dementia cases, and was absent in studies where cognitive decline was used as the endpoint.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This indicates that most of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs from observational studies are likely to be the result of recall bias, prescription bias, and publication bias.
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Before further large and costly trials are designed to assess the potential protective effects of NSAIDS, the specific critical pathways in the inflammatory process in dementia amendable to drug intervention should be identified.

0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	0	Managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia BRIAN LAWLOR, FRCPsych.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	1	Jonathan Swift Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, St James's Hospital, St James Street, Dublin 8, Ireland.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	2	 has received honoraria and hospitality from pharmaceutical companies working in the fields of Alzheimer's disease and behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	3	Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common and problematic in clinical practice and represent a significant part of the day-to-day workload of the old age psychiatry team in hospital, institution and community settings.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Improving our recognition and management of BPSD can have a positive impact on the quality of life of our patients and their carers and potentially delay the transition from home to institutional care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	5	Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia is an umbrella term that embraces a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviours that occur in people with dementia.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The concept of BPSD is a descriptive one and does not reflect a diagnostic entity but rather high-lights an important clinical dimension of dementia that has until recently been ignored from both research and therapeutic points of view.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	7	 One approach to the description of BPSD is the use of a list of observed behaviours (wandering, agitation, sexually inappropriate behaviours) and elicited psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, delusions) (Finkel et al, 1996).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This approach fails to take into account the fact that many so-called elicited symptoms (depression, delusions) also represent observed behaviours ( looks depressed ,  acts as though hallucinating or deluded ), and the fact that most of these symptoms and behaviours do not occur in isolation but tend to occur together in clusters or syndromes.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	9	 A number of syndromes have been described on the basis of factor analytical studies using rating instruments designed to measure BPSD (Frisoni et al, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	10	 These syndromes include depression, psychosis, psychomotor agitation, aggression and apathy.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Both depression and psychosis are included as descriptors in the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's disease (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and, more recently, diagnostic criteria for a distinct syndrome of psychosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for depression of Alzheimer's disease have been proposed (Jeste  and  Finkel, 2000; Olin et al, 2002).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	12	 It is likely that diagnostic criteria for other behavioural syndromes of dementia will also be developed in the near future and this will facilitate recognition and future therapeutic targeting of more specific aspects of BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	13	Although behaviour and psychological symptoms are not included as core features in the definition of the dementia syndrome, about two-thirds of people with dementia experience some BPSD at any one time point, and for one-third of community-dwelling people with dementia the level of BPSD will be in the clinically significant range (Lyketsos et al, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The figure for clinically significant BPSD rises to almost 80% for people with dementia residing in care environments (Margallo-Lana et al, 2001).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Prevalence estimates for BPSD vary widely because of the heterogeneity of patient populations studied in terms of setting and type of dementia, and the different definitions used for BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The recent application of standardised and validated assessment instruments is resulting in more consistent data for community-and clinic-based populations.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Two population-based studies, one from the USA (Lyketsos et al, 2000) and one from the UK (Burns et al, 1990), show similar prevalence figures of about 20% for BPSD in people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Unlike the cognitive dysfunction in dementia, which progressively worsens over time, many BPSD tend to fluctuate, with psycho-motor agitation being the most persistent (Devanand et al, 1997).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Further research is needed into the natural history and longitudinal course of BPSD to inform clinicians about the appropriate duration of pharmacological interventions and what advice and information should be given to families distressed by these symptoms and behaviours.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	20	The occurrence of BPSD is often the triggering event for recognition and referral of people with dementia to specialist services, to which patients and families present in crisis and disarray, relatively late in the course of the illness.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The development of BPSD is a major risk factor for caregiver burden (Coen et al, 1997) and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992), and is more important in this regard than the enduring cognitive deficits of the disease process (Steele et al, 1990).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	22	 All aspects of BPSD can be associated with caregiver burden, but paranoia, aggression and sleep wake cycle disturbance appear to be particularly important drivers of caregiver burden and institutionalisation (O'Donnell et al, 1992).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The development of BPSD is also associated with a worse prognosis and a more rapid rate of illness progression (Paulsen et al, 2000), and adds significantly to the direct and indirect costs of care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Expert assessment and targeted treatment of BPSD can alleviate patient suffering and promote caregiver well-being, but will be less effective if interventions occur after the support system has been ruptured.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	25	In the assessment of individuals with dementia at all stages of the illness, careful enquiry must be made regarding the presence of BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The emphasis here must be to detect BPSD before caregiver burn-out and irretrievable damage to the support environment occur.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Just as the collateral history and the use of an objective performance-based test must be part of any comprehensive cognitive assessment, so too should the history and assessment focus on behavioural and psychological symptoms, given their high frequency and impact on both patient and caregiver quality of life.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	28	Recognition of BPSD is the first and most important step in devising a management plan and will be facilitated by the use of standardised assessment scales such as the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (Behave AD) (Reisberg et al, 1987) or the Neuro-psychiatric Inventory (NPI; Cummings et al, 1994).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The characteristics of the behaviour or symptoms together with the frequency, severity and impact on the patient and caregiver must be identified before formulating a tailored and targeted plan of action which is likely to involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	30	 It is useful to identify target syndromes in the patient: is this primarily a psychotic syndrome (hallucinations or delusions), or is the main problem psycho-motor agitation and sleep disturbance? The context of the behaviour or symptom and its impact are also key elements in assessment.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Aggressive resistance when a personal activity is being carried out with the patient may not warrant immediate pharmacological intervention.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Also, mis-identification symptoms as part of a psychotic syndrome can be more distressing to carers than to patients and in such instances education of family members rather than drug treatment is required.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	33	Pharmacological treatments Drug treatments in BPSD should be evidence-based and targeted to specific syndromes that are clinically significant because of their frequency, pervasiveness or impact.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	34	 For depression in dementia, although there is little placebo-controlled evidence to guide practice, clinical experience indicates that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are safe and effective.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Neuroleptic agents have been shown to be more effective than placebo for aggression, psychosis and agitation in dementia (Devanand et al, 1998; De Deyn et al, 1999; Street et al, 2000), and novel agents are superior to conventional neuroleptics in terms of tolerability and side-effect profile.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Non-neuroleptic treatments such as carbamazepine have demonstrated efficacy over placebo in the treatment of agitation (Tariot et al, 1998).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Recent placebo-controlled studies suggest that cholinesterase inhibitors improve the apathetic syndrome in Alzheimer's disease and also decrease psychotic symptoms, particularly hallucinations, in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia (Cummings, 2000; McKeith et al, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	38	Non-pharmacological treatments There is a dearth of controlled evidence for psychological interventions in BPSD.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Individualised music therapy, bright light treatment and specific behaviour interventions have been found to improve certain troubling behavioural symptoms in dementia, but more evidence is required in this area (Devanand  and  Lawlor, 2000).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	40	Interventions for the carer Boosting caregiver support, increasing  time for self  and providing carer education and training in the management of BPSD can be effective in decreasing burden and mollifying its impact on the carer (Ostwald et al, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Interventions with carers may not only decrease carer burden and improve the tolerability of the particular symptom (Hepburn et al, 2001) but can also have a positive impact on patient behaviour (Marriott et al, 2000) and possibly delay institutionalisation (Brodaty et al, 1993; Teri, 1999).
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	42	The behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are now accepted as an important therapeutic target.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Management strategies, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, together with carer-focused training and education approaches, can be effective in decreasing BPSD but require concerted multi-disciplinary team input.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	44	 While the old age psychiatry team is well positioned to address the care needs of patients with BPSD, there are certain resource and training needs attached to the delivery of such care.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Some degree of special interest development in the area of BPSD should be encouraged within the multi-disciplinary team and the adoption of evidence-based guidelines and standardised assessments promoted.
0.23731914.12456513.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Ongoing training and professional education of team members in BPSD should be given priority so that the highest standards of care can be provided for patients and their carers.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The apparent replication of linkage in different studies using populations of mixed European descent made this region attractive for further investigation.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	15	One candidate gene in 10q23-q25 that falls on the edge of our linkage peak (1), but beneath those reported by other groups (2,3), is the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (insulysin EC 3.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Polymorphisms in IDE have been associated with type 2 diabetes in the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat model (4).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	17	 IDE can degrade a number of peptides, including insulin IGF-I and -II, transforming growth factor, atrial natriuretic peptide, and oxidatively damaged proteins (5).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	18	To examine the association of IDE variants with FPG, mFPG, and HbA1c, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and near the IDE gene in a sample of unrelated subjects and a set of families from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (Tables 1 and 2) (6).

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Under an additive model, borderline associations were found for rs1887922 with levels of FPG (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	50	 We found no significant associations with rs2209972 in the family set, as might be expected due to weaker associations observed in the unrelated sample.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	51	To evaluate whether the particular polymorphisms in IDE accounted for the linkage previously reported (1 to 3), we adjusted the linkage model for the rs1887922 polymorphism.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	52	 No change in either peak height or peak position was found (results not shown), suggesting that another gene present in this region accounts for the linkage signal.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The lower associations, observed when SNPs rs967878 and rs884526 were analyzed individually, can be explained by the presence of the major allele on haplotypes with both high and low trait values, thus diminishing the contrast with minor allele trait values.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	69	  Adding SNPs rs967878 (minor allele A) and rs884526 (minor allele T) did not improve the model, but revealed that the haplotype TATT (f30%) was associated with lowest trait values, while the haplotype CCGC (f16%) was associated with highest trait values (Fig.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	70	 2C), consistent with the two-locus analysis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The lower associations observed when SNPs rs967878 and rs884526 were analyzed individually may be explained by the presence of the major allele on haplotypes that had both high and low trait values, thus diminishing contrasts with minor allele trait values (Fig.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Haplotype analysis was not performed in families due to the problems in obtaining estimated haplotypes in the presence of LD (11).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	73	We also tested the association of the two-locus haplotypes with type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The global model was not significant when the whole sample was tested.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In contrast, global models for sex-specific analyses of men were significant and indicated that the CC haplotype was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.

0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	77	 The odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of the CC haplotype relative to the TT haplotype was 1.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	78	To evaluate whether subjects with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes accounted for the sex-specific associations observed, men that met the criterion for impaired plasma glucose (IPG) were excluded from analysis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Significant global associations with the rs1887922 SNP and glycemic trait levels were still seen in the subsidiary male dataset for FPG (P  <  0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Similarly, the haplotype TT was associated with low trait values for HbA1c (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	81	023) and the CC haplotype with high trait values of HbA1c (P = 0.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	82	 These results indicate a role for the IDE locus in normal glucose homeostasis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	83	We thus present evidence for the association between polymorphic markers in the IDE gene on 10q23-q25 with levels of FPG, mFPG, HbA1c and type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect of rs1887922 and rs2209972 on trait levels of the individual SNPs is most pronounced in men.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This may be partly due to an increased number of men with IPG in the unrelated set as compared with women.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, associations were still statistically significant following the exclusion of men with IPG from the analysis of men, suggesting that this is not the only explanation.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Male-specific susceptibility has been reported in two murine models of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity (12,13).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	88	 In one model, based on crosses of NON/lt and obese NZO/HI mice, a number of susceptibility genes that determine the threshold for type 2 diabetes have been mapped, none of which lie on the Y chromosome (12).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Android obesity has been previously described as a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (14), although the associations reported here persist after adjustment for BMI.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	90	The TT haplotype, representing the minor allele of rs2209972 and the major allele of rs1887992, was associated with lowered trait values, suggesting that it encodes an IDE variant with reduced activity that increases the efficiency of insulin signaling.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Less insulin would therefore be needed to reduce blood glucose levels.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In contrast, the CC haplotype IDE variant may diminish insulin action, leading to higher trait values and type 2 diabetes.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	93	The associations with HbA1c and FPG map to the 3' region of IDE and are unlikely to involve the protease domain of the enzyme, which lies at the 5' end of the gene (5).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Similarly, mutations to IDE in the GK rat model of type 2 diabetes do not affect protease activity (4).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	95	 A number of alternative molecular mechanisms provide plausible explanations for delayed or diminished action of IDE.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	96	 For example, a change in the 3' untranslated region of IDE may affect the stability or the translation of the message, altering levels of IDE protein produced.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Alternatively, coding polymorphisms in the carboxyl terminal region of the protein may modify cellular localization, homodimerization (15), or interaction with protein partners.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	98	Other genes on 10q23-q25 appear to contribute to linkage of this region reported previously by others and us with glycemic traits (1 to 3), as the signal for FPG was not diminished by adjustment for the rs1887922 SNP.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Association studies may be more efficient than linkage studies in identifying genetic determinants of complex traits when allele frequency is relatively high and the effect small (16).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	100	 This finding is consistent with the associations we see here with the IDE CC haplotype (f16%), which is about twice as likely to be associated with type 2 diabetes as the TT haplotype.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Typing of additional SNPs will be necessary to identify other gene variants on 10q23 to 25 that affect glucose homeostasis.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	102	It has been proposed that typing one SNP per haplotype block will be sufficient for genome-wide association studies (17,18).
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Here, we show that two SNPs rs1887922 and rs884526 on the same haplotype block vary in association with trait values due to the different haplotypes on which their minor allele is found.
0.31976065.12765971.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Typing only one SNP per haplotype block may not be sufficient in all cases to reliably detect or exclude associations of candidate loci with complex diseases.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This makes VR22 an attractive candidate gene because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1, which has many mutations that elevate Ass42 and cause early onset familial AD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We identified two intronic VR22 SNPs (4360 and 4783) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) that showed highly significant association (P=0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This association clearly contributed to the linkage at 80 cM because the lod scores decreased when linkage analysis was performed conditional upon the VR22 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	11	 This association replicated in another independent set of 12 LOAD families (P=0.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Bounding of the association region using multiple SNPs showed VR22 to be the only confirmed gene within the region of association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These findings indicate that VR22 has variant(s) which influence Ass42 and contribute to the previously reported linkage for plasma Ass42 in LOAD families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a complex genetic disorder (1) with an onset defined as  > 60 to 65 years of age.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Twin studies have suggested that as much as 74% of the risk for LOAD may be due to genetic factors (2,3).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It is well established that ApoE plays an important role in the genetics of LOAD (4,5).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A recent study has estimated, however, that four additional loci make a contribution to the variance in LOAD age at onset that have an effect size similar to or greater than that of ApoE (6).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Given the heterogeneity that is likely if at least five loci contribute substantially to the genetics of LOAD, it is not surprising that the large number of single gene association studies that have been performed have so far failed to identify variants that associate reproducibly with LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Other reasons for failure of replication are possible gene to gene, gene to environment interactions that can be difficult to account for and poor study design.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	20	Several groups (7 to 9) have suggested that quantitative, intermediate phenotypes may be useful in unraveling the complex genetics of disorders such as LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Clinical disease states such as LOAD are likely to result from an uncertain, complex sequence of pathophysiologic events whereas intermediate phenotypes may be more directly related to the action of a set of genes that are more easily identified.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Thus the identification of genes with variants that contribute to specific intermediate phenotypes may be a tractable way to identify at least some of the genes that contribute to diseases governed by complex genetics.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To optimize the utility of this approach, it is important to select intermediate phenotypes that are highly heritable and have a close biological link to the disease in question.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	24	In our studies, we have focused on levels of the amyloid ss protein (Ass), specifically Ass42, as a quantitative intermediate phenotype for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Ass is a secreted protein (10 to 12) derived from a set of large precursor proteins collectively referred to as the amyloid ss protein precursor.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Secreted Ass, which is produced by virtually all cells, is readily detected in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Most secreted Ass has forty amino acids (Ass40) but a small fraction (5 to 10%) has two additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Ass42) (13 to 15).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In the brains of all patients with AD, a large amount of Ass aggregates and is deposited in senile plaques, much of it in the form of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	29	 To make a definite diagnosis of AD, large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles must be demonstrated in the brain at autopsy (16).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In all LOAD patients, a large amount of the Ass deposited in senile plaques ends at Ass42.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	31	 In one-third of cases, Ass ending at Ass42 is essentially the only form of Ass deposited, in one-third it is the predominant form and in one-third a large amount of Ass40 is also deposited (17).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It is worth noting that synthetic Ass40 and Ass42 both spontaneously assemble into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but Ass42 forms amyloid fibrils far more rapidly than Ass40 (18,19).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The brain has very high levels of APP mRNA; the concentration of Ass in cerebrospinal fluid is 50 times higher than in plasma; and mixed fetal brain cultures produce far more Ass than other types of cultured cells (12,20,21).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Thus it is likely that senile plaques form specifically in the brain because Ass levels are higher in the brain than in other organs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	35	The APP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes have many, fully penetrant mutations that cause early onset familial AD (EOFAD) (22 to 25).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Apart from its early onset and causation by specific mutations, EOFAD is clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	37	 We and others have shown that the EOFAD mutations all increase Ass42 and sometimes increase Ass40 as well (15,26 to 30).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Importantly, we observed plasma Ass42 elevations both in EOFAD patients and in young, cognitively normal carriers of EOFAD mutations (31).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	39	 We also observed Ass42 elevations in plasma from non-demented relatives of LOAD patients between the ages of 20 and 65 (32).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Importantly, these elevations were not associated with the ApoE4 allele or with variants in any of the EOFAD genes (32).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	41	 (33) found in a longitudinal study of unrelated elderly individuals, that those who subsequently developed AD had higher plasma levels of Ass42 than did those who remained free of dementia.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Collectively these findings show that Ass42 is closely linked to AD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	43	 To investigate the heritability of plasma Ass, we analyzed extended LOAD families and found that plasma Ass40 and Ass42 levels both have substantial heritability (34).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	44	Given these findings that the level of plasma Ass42 was likely to be useful as an intermediate, quantitative phenotype for LOAD, we performed variance components linkage analysis on this trait in a group of extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	45	 This analysis showed significant linkage to a locus at 80 cM on chromosome 10 (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Linkage to the same region was obtained independently in a study of affected LOAD sib-pairs (36).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Together, these two studies provide strong evidence for a novel LOAD locus on chromosome 10 that acts to increase Ass42.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The sib-pair group estimated the effect of this locus to be equivalent to that of ApoE, suggesting that it was likely to be a major risk factor for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	49	 A third group found linkage in a more downstream region of chromosome 10 and focused on the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as a possible candidate gene in this region (37).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	50	 More recently, a fourth group using age of onset as a quantitative phenotype in AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) families found suggestive linkage to chromosome 10 at 133 to 135 cM (38).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	51	An important advantage of the variance components approach employed here is that candidate genes, identified through their likely effect on Ass42, can be evaluated systematically to determine how much various within-gene variants contribute to linkage.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In this study, we analyzed VR22 for variants that contribute to the linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Both its location and function make VR22 a strong candidate gene.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Located at 80 cM at the peak of the previously reported linkage signal, VR22 encodes a novel catenin, -T catenin, which was recently cloned by Jannsens et al.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The catenins interact closely with ss catenin and play an important role in intercellular adhesion as strong intercellular adhesion depends on linkage of the cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton via the /ss catenin complex.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	56	 -T catenin is closely homologous to -N catenin, which is neuron specific, and to -E catenin, which is expressed in all tissues.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	57	 -T catenin is expressed at high levels in testis and heart, but it is also expressed in human and mouse brain (39).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	58	 -T catenin has overall sequence identity of 56 and 58% with -E and -N catenin respectively.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	59	 (39) have shown that that -T catenin interacts with ss catenin in a functionally effective fashion.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This makes VR22 a strong functional candidate because ss catenin interacts with presenilin 1 (40), which has many mutations that increase Ass42 (26,29,31) and cause early onset familial AD (24).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	61	 (40) has shown that loss of signalling through the ss catenin pathway leads to enhanced neuronal vulnerability to Ass.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	62	 In addition, ss catenin and presenilin forms a complex that leads to stabilization of the former, such that destabilization of this complex leads to ss catenin degradation and enhanced neuronal apoptosis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Presenilin mutations were shown to lead to destabilization of the ss catenin to presenilin complex, degradation of the ss catenin and enhanced Ass production.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Given that catenins provide the link between ss catenin and its binding counterparts (such as presenilins) to the actin cytoskeleton, it is possible to postulate that mutations in catenins could lead to disruption of the stability of the ss catenin to presenilin complex resulting in enhanced neuronal vulnerability of cells to Ass and increased Ass production.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	65	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION SUBJECTS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Association between VR22 SNPs and plasma Ass42 In our initial assessment of VR22, we examined three SNPs [4825 (C/A), 4783 (A/G) and 4360 (T/C)] in the intron between exons 10 and 11.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	66	 These SNPs (Table 1), which spanned 465 bp, were genotyped in the 10 extended LOAD families previously analyzed for linkage (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	67	 In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The effect of each of the three VR22 SNPs was analyzed by encoding it as a covariate and testing its effect on the variance of plasma Ass42 in a regression style approach implemented in SOLAR (Table 1).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	69	 To control for the effect of linkage, the linkage component was included in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The 4360 (T/C) and 4783 (A/G) SNPs, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, both showed strong association (P=0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	88	 These SNPs were selected to be in several groups, which were designed to span the entire VR22 gene at 250 kb intervals as well as the region 3' of VR22.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, given the size of VR22, and our extent of coverage throughout and outside this gene, association signals we did identify with the 4360 to 4783 VR22 SNPs will be well-bounded within VR22 with this SNP genotyping design.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Three to six SNPs were analyzed in each group, and linkage disequilibrium between the most significantly associating 4360 SNP and the other SNPs was analyzed in the 22 combined families (Fig.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	106	This bounding approach effectively limits the region of potential association on both the 3 and 5 sides of 4360 to within VR22.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Thus, our data provide strong evidence that the association of the 4360 and 4783 SNPs with plasma Ass42 is due to variant(s) in the VR22 gene.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	108	Given that a total of 51 SNPs were genotyped, the issue of multiple testing can be raised.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Many of the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and therefore are not independent from one another (Fig.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Therefore, a simple Bonferroni correction under the assumption of 51 independent tests is overly conservative for this study.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Nonetheless, even when Bonferroni correction is applied, the 4783 and 4360 SNPs are still significant in the 10 families (P=0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	114	Contribution of VR22 association to linkage at 80 cM We next investigated the contribution of the VR22 4360/4783 association to the linkage that we previously reported.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Our initial linkage findings were obtained using seven markers covering 14 cM on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	116	 To analyze the entirety of chromosome 10, we genotyped 26 additional markers spanning 165 cM in the 10 LOAD families.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	124	  The reason for the broader and flatter peak in this fine-mapping analysis may be several-fold.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	125	 First, we utilized the MCMC MIBD estimation implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47) for the multipoint linkage results presented in this paper as opposed to the regression-based MIBD estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was used in our original paper (34, see also Subjects and Methods).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Second, genotyping of additional markers leads to more information regarding recombination that could potentially lead to a decrease in the original linkage signal obtained by fewer markers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Third, utilizing a larger number of markers increases the likelihood of map or genotyping errors, despite the implementation of strict genotype-quality control measures.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Indeed, others have also found that fine-mapping with more markers can lead to a lowering in their original lod scores obtained with a lesser number of markers (48,49).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	129	To evaluate the extent to which the 4360 and 4783 SNPs [or functional SNP(s) associated with this tightly linked pair] account for the linkage observed, we repeated linkage analysis after regressing out the effect of the VR22 4360 association by including it as a covariate in the linkage model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	130	 After regressing out the effect of this SNP, the multipoint linkage signal diminished substantially in the 10 combined families (Fig.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	131	 This marked diminution in lod scores indicates that a substantial proportion of the linkage signal for plasma Ass42 is accounted for by the VR22 4360 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The residual linkage signal that persisted after regressing out the VR22 4360 association indicates that there are likely to be additional variants that contribute to linkage, though this residual signal may also be due to random variation.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The diminution in the maximum multipoint lod scores, upon inclusion of the 4360 SNP as a covariate, is also evident from the comparison of the variance component model that excludes this covariate (Table 3B) to the one that includes it (Table 3C).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The P-value for the major gene effect at the maximum multipoint locus goes from 0.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We found two VR22 SNPs, 4360 and 4783, which showed significant, robust association with plasma Ass42 in 20 to 65-year-old family members of the extended LOAD families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	139	 These two SNPs are 423 bp apart, and they are in such strong LD that they give virtually identical results.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The 4360 and 4783 SNPs are located in the 177 kb intron between exons 10 and 11 at a distance of 1.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We identified 11 additional SNPs within 6 kb of 4360/4783, eight in the intron between exons 10 and 11 and three in the intron between exons 11 and 12, but none of these SNPs gave more significant association than 4360/4783.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Careful bounding showed that the large (1.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	143	7 Mb) VR22 gene is the only confirmed gene within the region of 4360/4783 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Analyses in which 4360 was used as a covariate in both the null and linkage models reduced the multipoint lod score indicating that the VR22 4360/4783 association contributes to linkage.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The large reduction observed when all 10 families were analyzed suggests that the 4360/4783 association contributes substantially to the linkage signal observed in these families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	146	 The presence of residual linkage after regressing out the effect of VR22 4360 SNP indicates, however, that the 4360 association does not entirely account for linkage.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Thus our data provide substantial evidence that VR22 variant(s) contribute to the linkage signal we previously reported.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Though the residual linkage signal may be due to random variation, it could also indicate that there may be additional variants that contribute to linkage.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Whether these variants are in the large VR22 gene or in nearby gene(s) remains to be determined.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	151	4 kb from the nearest exon, 4360 and 4783 are unlikely to have a functional effect, and their association with Ass42 presumably occurs because they are in LD with one or several functional VR22 SNPs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Our sequencing of all VR22 exons in the only reported VR22 transcript (39) failed to identify any potentially functional SNP(s) that could account for the 4360/4783 association.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	153	 It is possible that there are functional SNPs that affect the splicing of known or alternatively spliced exons, in strong LD with 4360/4783.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	154	The basic premise in studying plasma Ass42 as an intermediate phenotype is that genes with variants that influence plasma Ass42 will be genes with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The results reported here are useful because they identify VR22 as a gene with variants that influence plasma Ass42, thereby increasing the likelihood that VR22 is the gene (or one of the genes) in the 80 cM region of chromosome 10 with variants that influence risk for LOAD.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	156	 An important, unanswered question is how well the effect of a SNP on plasma Ass42 will correlate with its effect on the AD phenotype.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	157	 It is unlikely that the change in plasma Ass42 caused by a specific genetic variant directly increases risk for AD; increased risk for AD is probably produced by a related effect that the variant has within the brain.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus it is conceivable, perhaps even likely, that a specific variant with a strong influence on plasma Ass42 may sometimes have little or no influence on the AD phenotype and vice versa.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	159	 It is only by thoroughly studying several genes and elucidating the effects of the entire set of functional variants on the plasma Ass42 and AD phenotypes that this question can be answered.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	160	 It may be that effects on the two phenotypes correlate well for the variants in some genes and poorly in others.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	161	The results reported here indicate that VR22 variants significantly associate with plasma Ass42 and account for a substantial portion of our linkage signal on chromosome 10.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Additional analysis is needed to identify the entire set of functional variants that account for the Ass42 linkage at 80 cM.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Once they are identified it will be important to test their effects on Ass production and VR22 gene function by biological experiments; as well as to determine whether these functional variants modify the risk for AD.

0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	196	where is the matrix of the probabilities that each pair of individuals share genetic material identical by descent for a given chromosomal location (estimated from the genetic marker data), 2 is the matrix of kinship coefficients describing polygenic factors and I is the identity matrix describing sporadic environmental factors.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	197	In addition, the effect of shared-environment (h2) on the variance of the trait can also be estimated by including a household matrix in the model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	198	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0, otherwise.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	200	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass42, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Since almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element=1 for those individuals from the same extended family and 0, otherwise.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We realize that by doing so, we are probably being overly conservative.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Since the shared-family (household) effect employed to account for potential batch to batch variance in the assay overlaps with the kinship effect (55), inclusion of the household matrix almost certainly overcorrects for batch to batch variance and underestimates the shared-genetic effect.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	204	 For this reason, we performed the heritability and linkage analyses, both with and without the household matrix in the model.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	205	 The multipoint results shown in Figures 2 and 3 include the household matrix.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The analyses without the household matrix yielded slightly better lod scores and higher heritabilities in general.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	207	The scalars q2, g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	208	 For heritability estimations, we compared an environmental model where q2 and g2 were fixed at zero and h2 and e2 were estimated, to the polygenic model where g2, h2 and e2 were estimated.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The linkage analyses were performed by comparing the polygenic model to the linkage model where q2 was also estimated.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The difference between the two log10 likelihoods for the models produces a lod score that is equivalent to the classical lod score of linkage analysis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	211	 We incorporated sex, age, age2, sex*age, and sex*age2 as covariates in the heritability estimations.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	212	 None of these covariates were significant at P < 0.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	213	05 therefore, they were excluded from the multipoint linkage analysis.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	214	In order to minimize age and dementia-related environmental effects on plasma Ass42 levels, we performed all of our analyses on the 20 to 65 year age group, as in our previous studies (34,35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Since variance components methods are based on the underlying assumption that the quantitative trait being analyzed has a normal distribution, 10log(Ass42) levels were used as the phenotypes.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Extreme outliers with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 standard deviations beyond the mean were excluded from the analyses.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Thus the 10log(Ass42) phenotype analyzed had a normal distribution.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Plasma Ass measurements were done using a well established sandwich ELISA system as described previously (15).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	219	 All samples were measured in duplicate.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Each ELISA plate included samples from five volunteers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The results from these five standard samples were used to normalize the values obtained so as to reduce plate-to-plate and day-to-day variance.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	222	Identity-by-descent probability estimations The identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities at each genotyped marker were estimated using the pairwise likelihood-based estimation method implemented in SOLAR (53).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	223	 These IBD estimates were used to obtain the twopoint lod scores.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Multipoint IBD probabilities were also estimated at each centimorgan between each pair of adjacent markers using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multipoint IBD estimation approach implemented in the Simwalk2 package (46,47).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	225	 The MCMC process was run twice, once with the default length of 1000 replicates and a second time by doubling this process length.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	226	 Multipoint linkage analyses using these MIBD matrices were done using the variance components methodology implemented in SOLAR.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	227	 The results using the shorter and longer runs were similar.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	228	 The results of the latter are presented here.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Given that the computation time increases with the marker number and that our two most upstream markers yielded no evidence for linkage in any of the datasets, these two markers (D10S1435 and D10S189) were omitted from the MIBD estimations.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	230	 There are two major differences between the MIBD estimations utilized in our previous report of linkage on chromosome 10 and the current study (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	231	 The results of the previous linkage were obtained as result of genotyping seven markers in a 13 cM region, and the current study utilizes 31 markers spread from 28.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Second, the MIBD estimation approaches that we used in the previous and current studies are different.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The MCMC approach implemented in Simwalk2 (46,47) that we utilized in this study is different from the MIBD probability estimation algorithm implemented in SOLAR, which was the approach we utilized in our initial analysis of seven chromosome 10 markers.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	234	 (47), demonstrated significant differences between the results obtained by these two methods using the same dataset and concluded that the multipoint MCMC approach yielded more accurate MIBD probability estimates for inter-marker loci.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	235	 For this reason, we utilized the MCMC approach in this study.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	236	Tests of association We initially tested for association between the SNPs and plasma Ass42 in the 10 extended LOAD families using a regression based covariate approach in the variance components paradigm implemented in the computer program SOLAR (53).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	237	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, we included the linkage component (q2) in both the null and alternative models tested.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	238	 We used the multipoint IBD matrix () that yielded the maximum multipoint lod score at 80 cM in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	239	 The multipoint IBD probabilities in the matrix , were estimated in Simwalk, using the genetic marker information as described above.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	240	To test the effect of specific SNP genotypes, we used the measured genotype approach where we included the copy number of the SNP allele as a covariate in the analysis and regressed the plasma Ass42 phenotype on this covariate for each individual.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	241	 The measured genotype approach is a classical test for differences in trait mean by genotype described theoretically previously (56,57).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This approach was also utilized in previous association studies of SNPs and various quantitative traits in extended families (58,59).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	243	 For individuals with an XX, XY or YY SNP genotype, we used a covariate that takes the value of 0, 1 or 2, respectively.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	244	 This formulation assumes that the SNP is an additive QTL.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The model that includes the covariate is tested against the model that does not include it to determine its effect on the quantitative trait of interest.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Twice the difference in natural log likelihoods of these two models is distributed as a 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	247	 In order to test for association above and beyond linkage, residual genetic and same-household effects, these three components were included in both the null and alternative models.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	248	 We first tested for association between the SNPs and Ass42 in the 10 LOAD families that we previously used to describe linkage to chromosome 10 (35).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	249	 In order to control for the effect of linkage, residual genetic effects and same-household effects in this group, we estimated the effect of each SNP on the background of a model that included our 80 cM multipoint identity-by-descent matrix, as well as kinship and household matrices.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	250	 We then tested each SNP for association with Ass42 in a second, independent set of 12 LOAD families, and also analyzed the combined group of 22 families.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	251	Linkage analysis conditional upon association A conditional linkage analysis that accounts for association with a functional polymorphism (or one in strong LD with it) at the linkage locus will decrease or eliminate the linkage signal (58,59).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	252	 For this reason, we performed linkage analysis conditional on the association with our most strongly associating SNP (4360TC).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	253	 We performed this test by estimating the proportion of variance due to linkage on the background of a model that included this SNP as a covariate and comparing it to a linkage only model that excluded this covariate.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	254	Analysis of linkage disequilibrium We measured linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs and the haplotype groups within the 22 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (60).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We used the expectation-maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (61) to determine various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient D (62).
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	256	 This algorithm determines LD from the founders and married-ins.
0.22725685.14559775.html.plaintext.txt	257	 LD was estimated between the VR22 4360 SNP and all other SNPs.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	5	A pathological feature of Type 2 diabetes is deposits in the pancreatic islets primarily composed of amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Although much attention has been paid to the expression and secretion of amylin, little is known about the enzymes involved in amylin turnover.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Recent reports suggest that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) may have specificity for amyloidogenic proteins, and therefore we sought to determine whether amylin is an IDE substrate.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Amylin-degrading activity co-purified with IDE from rat muscle through several chromatographic steps.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Metalloproteinase inhibitors inactivated amylin-degrading activity with a pattern consistent with the enzymatic properties of IDE, whereas inhibitors of acid and serine proteases, calpains, and the proteasome were ineffective.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Amylin degradation was inhibited by insulin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas insulin degradation was inhibited by amylin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Other substrates of IDE such as atrial natriuretic peptide and glucagon also competitively inhibited amylin degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Radiolabeled amylin and insulin were both covalently cross-linked to a protein of 110 kDa, and the binding was competitively inhibited by either unlabeled insulin or amylin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, a monoclonal anti-IDE antibody immunoprecipitated both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The data strongly suggest that IDE is an amylin-degrading enzyme and plays an important role in the clearance of amylin and the prevention of islet amyloid formation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	15	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	16	A pathologic feature of as many as 90% of persons with Type 2 diabetes is the presence of islet amyloid deposits comprised predominantly of the peptide amylin, also known as islet amyloid polypeptide (reviewed in Ref.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	17	 These deposits are thought to contribute to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, either by direct cytotoxicity or by reducing beta cell mass (2).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid formation, and how fibril formation is prevented under normal conditions, is therefore of particular interest in the study of Type 2 diabetes.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Because amylin is continually produced in non-diabetic humans with no amyloid formation, the mere presence of amylin is not sufficient to cause fibril formation, a concept that has been supported in studies using transgenic mice expressing human amylin (3).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Further studies have suggested that amyloid formation is associated with metabolic perturbations, such as hyperglycemia or high fat intake (4).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Therefore, a shift in the amylin balance either by altering synthesis, secretion, or degradation could contribute to amyloid formation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although there have been numerous studies regarding amylin synthesis and secretion, at present there have been few studies exploring the degradation of amylin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	23	The levels of proteins are regulated by both synthesis and degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of insulin is insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE),1 also known as insulysin (E.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	25	 A metallothiolproteinase found primarily in the cytosol, IDE has been detected in lesser amounts in endosomes, peroxisomes, on the plasma membrane, and in an extracellular form (reviewed in Ref.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition to insulin, a number of other proteins have been identified as IDE substrates, including proteins structurally related to insulin such as proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor II, and relaxin (6), and seemingly unrelated peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and glucagon (7, 8).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, insulin, ANP, and glucagon all contain regions that can form beta-pleated sheets, and thus are amyloid-forming peptides (9).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Thus, it has been proposed that, rather than displaying specificity for a primary sequence motif, IDE is specific for amyloidogenic peptides (8, 10).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Indeed, recently the Alzheimer's -amyloid peptide was shown to be degraded by IDE, and IDE was implicated in regulating extracellular levels of -amyloid peptide (11-13).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, because amylin is an amyloid-forming peptide, it may also be a substrate for IDE.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The studies presented here characterize an amylin-degrading activity purified from rat muscle and identify the degrading enzyme as IDE.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	73	Purification of IDE was carried out by sequential purification from rat skeletal muscle by a modification of chromatographic methods described previously (14, 15).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Amylin-degrading activity purified through all steps with IDE, and the specific activity increased throughout the procedure (Table I), resulting in a 180-fold enrichment of amylin degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	75	 For comparison, insulin-degrading activity was purified 140-fold in the same series (not shown).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To further characterize this activity, 125I-amylin degradation was measured in the presence of increasing doses of unlabeled amylin or insulin (Fig.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Both amylin and insulin reduced 125I-amylin degradation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 290 and 80 nM, respectively).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Similarly, when 125I-insulin degradation was measured (Fig.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	79	 2), both competitor amylin and insulin decreased 125I-insulin degradation (IC50 160 and 27 nM, respectively) with a similar profile to that in Fig.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	81	 To verify that the acid-soluble radioactivity was due to amylin degradation, 125I-amylin was incubated with purified IDE for 0 or 30 min, then analyzed by reverse-phase C18 chromatography (Fig.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	83	 After degradation by IDE, the disappearance of the amylin peak at 41 min was accompanied by the accumulation of three degradation products eluting at approximately 26, 31, and 35 min.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	84	 When the peak areas were quantified, the degree of degradation measured by HPLC was similar to that estimated by trichloroacetic acid in the same sample (~30% degraded).

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	101	To determine whether the amylin-degrading activity is due to IDE, a panel of inhibitors was used to characterize the enzymatic properties of the amylin-degrading activity (Table II).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The activity was greatly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, 1,10-phenanthroline, and bacitracin and inhibited to a lesser degree by EDTA and EGTA, consistent with the metallothiolproteinase characteristics of IDE.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Conversely, other cysteine proteinase inhibitors (E-64, leupeptin), inhibitors of acid proteases (pepstatin), serine proteases (aprotinin, leupeptin, PMSF) and calpains (ALLN), were ineffective at inhibiting amylin degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	104	 In addition, because ALLN at 1 mM is a potent proteasome inhibitor, degradation of amylin by the proteasome in this preparation can be ruled out.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	105	 Taken together, the amylin-degrading enzyme has the properties of a neutral metallothiolproteinase, and the inhibition profile is consistent with the enzymatic properties of IDE.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	108	Because IDE degrades other proteins in addition to insulin, the ability of these substrates to competitively inhibit amylin degradation was examined (Table III).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The IDE substrates insulin, glucagon, ANP, and ACTH all effectively inhibited the amylin-degrading activity.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	110	 In addition to human amylin, rat amylin also inhibited human amylin degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	111	 In contrast, EGF, which binds IDE but with low affinity, had little effect, and insulin C-peptide, which is not a IDE substrate, had no effect.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Taken together, these data demonstrate that the amylin-degrading activity is consistent with the enzymatic characteristics of IDE.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The data are expressed as percentage of inhibition of amylin-degrading activity in the absence of additional peptide.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	115	To examine amylin-binding proteins in the IDE preparation, covalent cross-linking experiments were performed.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Early experiments using traditional cross-linking reagents such as the homobifunctional amine-reactive disuccinimidyl suberate were unsuccessful when using amylin as the substrate.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	117	 This may have been due to the lack of reactive groups on the amylin molecule, which contains a single amino acid with primary amines (the N-terminal lysine).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	118	 Therefore, a heterobifunctional amine/photoreactive reagent (NHS-ASA) was used.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Partially purified IDE (through the ammonium sulfate precipitation step) was incubated with either 125I-amylin or 125I-insulin, and associated proteins were cross-linked with NHS-ASA (Fig.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In the absence of NHS-ASA (Me2SO only), no cross-linking of labeled amylin or insulin was detected.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In the presence of NHS-ASA, a radiolabeled band at approximately 110 kDa was readily detected using either 125I-amylin or 125I-insulin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	122	 This is consistent with amylin binding by IDE, which migrates on SDS-PAGE at 110 kDa.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	123	 In the presence of either excess insulin or amylin, the cross-linking to the 110-kDa protein was abolished, indicating the specificity of the binding.

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	143	The formation of amyloid deposits is a critical event in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Type 2 diabetes.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Much of the research performed to date has focused on the expression of the amyloid-forming proteins.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Little is known about the processes responsible for the turnover and clearance of amyloid-forming proteins.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Recently, IDE was implicated in the degradation of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide (11, 12).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Further studies have suggested that IDE plays a role in the control of extracellular levels of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide (13, 16).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Therefore, there is emerging evidence that a major role of IDE may be in the clearance of amyloid-forming peptides.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	149	Amylin is co-produced and co-packaged with insulin by pancreatic beta cells.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In as many as 90% of persons with Type 2 diabetes, amyloid plaques are found in the area of the beta cells, and contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The studies presented here identify IDE as an amylin-degrading enzyme.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In a typical series of purification steps used to isolate IDE, amylin-degrading activity co-purified with insulin-degrading activity through all steps.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	153	 The insulin-degrading activity was inhibited by amylin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas amylin-degrading activity was similarly inhibited by excess insulin, suggesting that both insulin and amylin are degraded by the same protease in the preparation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The inhibitor profile identifies the enzyme as a metallothiolproteinase with properties consistent with those reported previously for IDE.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	155	 On the other hand, the amylin-degrading activity was not inhibited by serine or acid protease inhibitors nor by an inhibitor of calpains and proteasomes.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The amylin-degrading proteinase had affinity for insulin, glucagon, ACTH, and ANP, but not for EGF or insulin C-peptide, all consistent with the specificity of IDE.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Using a cross-linking reagent, the association of a 110-kDa protein with radiolabeled amylin was detected.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	158	 This cross-linking was abolished in the presence of either excess insulin or amylin, indicating that the same protein binds both amylin and insulin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This finding was supported by the observation that radiolabeled insulin cross-linked to the 110-kDa protein was also eliminated with excess insulin or amylin, strongly suggesting that the 110-kDa insulin and amylin binding protein is IDE.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Finally, a well-characterized monoclonal antibody directed against IDE co-immunodepleted both insulin- and amylin-degrading activity, providing definitive evidence that IDE is the amylin-degrading proteinase.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	161	Because IDE is an amylin-degrading enzyme, it may play an important role in amylin homeostasis.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	162	 It is important to remember that in species expressing amyloidogenic amylin (including humans), amylin is continually present, yet does not normally aggregate into amyloid deposits.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Therefore, the mere presence of amylin does not predicate islet amyloid formation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This has been explored further in studies using transgenic animals.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although some lines of transgenic mice overexpressing human amylin displayed amyloid deposits (17, 18), others did not (3, 19-21), suggesting that elevated amylin alone may not be sufficient for amyloid formation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Therefore, a perturbation of some other element of amylin processing, such as amylin degradation, may be involved.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	167	Amylin from a number of species, including human, spontaneously aggregates into amyloid fibrils as a result of -pleated sheet formation around residues 20-29 of the primary sequence.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Rodent amylin, on the other hand, does not form amyloid, presumably because proline residues in this area of the molecule alter secondary structure (22).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In the studies presented here, IDE degraded both human and rat amylin.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	170	 It would follow that the recognition motif for IDE is not the -pleated sheet region itself, but the structure of the peptides in the non-amyloid-forming state.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Indeed, most if not all studies of IDE and insulin have been performed under conditions in which insulin does not spontaneously form amyloid fibrils.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The role of IDE may, therefore, be in the cleavage of peptides with the potential to form amyloid aggregates.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	173	 In this case, IDE can be thought of as a scavenger of amyloidogenic peptides.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Normally, a balance exists between deposition and degradation of the amyloidogenic peptide.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	175	 When the levels of the peptide exceed the capacity of IDE to degrade them, either by increased expression of the peptide, or decreased expression or enzymatic activity of IDE, the balance is shifted from degradation to deposition.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	176	 In the case of Type 2 diabetes, both insulin and amylin secretion are increased due to peripheral insulin resistance.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Because IDE has approximately 4-fold greater affinity for insulin than for amylin, amylin degradation will be proportionately impaired.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The increased production and relative decrease in degradation may allow sufficient accumulation of amylin to cause islet amyloid formation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	179	The site of both synthesis of amylin and deposition of islet amyloid, the pancreatic beta cells, is a logical site of amylin degradation.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	180	 An insulin-degrading enzyme consistent with the properties of IDE has been reported in islets and in a beta cell line (23).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Furthermore, recent studies in our laboratory have suggested that IDE is responsible for amylin degradation in a beta cell line and that inhibition of IDE increases the formation of amyloid by exogenous human amylin (24).
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	182	 If this proves to be the case, then IDE would be a critical player in the prevention of amyloid formation by amylin and perhaps other amyloidogenic peptides.
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	183	 A new area of study focusing on turnover of amyloidogenic peptides could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of amyloid diseases.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	4	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor found in association with senile plaques (SP) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	5	 A2M has been implicated biochemically in binding and degradation of the amyloid [beta] (A[beta]) protein which accumulates in SP.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	6	 We studied the relationship between Alzheimer's disease and a common A2M polymorphism, Val1000 (GTC)/Ile1000 (ATC), which occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In an initial exploratory data set (90 controls and 171 Alzheimer's disease) we noted an increased frequency of the G/G genotype from 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We therefore tested the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease in an additional independent data set: a group of 359 controls and 566 Alzheimer's disease patients.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In the hypothesis testing cohort, the G/G genotype increased from 0.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The odds ratio for Alzheimer's disease associated with the G/G genotype was 1.

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The presence of the G allele was associated with an increase in A[beta] burden in a small series.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The A2M receptor, A2M-r/LRP, is a multifunctional receptor whose ligands include apolipoprotein E and the amyloid precursor protein.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	15	 These four proteins have each been genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may participate in a common disease pathway.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	16	[alpha]2-Macroglobulin (A2M) is a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits proteinases of all classes by a steric trapping mechanism.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The tetrameric A2M structure undergoes a conformational change upon cleavage of a peptide bond in the bait region by a proteinase and this conformational change traps the proteinase.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	18	 A2M has been implicated in several pathophysiological processes in Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	19	 A2M immunostains senile plaques (SP) (1-3) and binds amyloid [beta] protein (A[beta]) 1-42 with high affinity (apparent Kd  <  1.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Moreover, recent data suggest that a serine proteinase-A2M complex can degrade A[beta] (5) and trypsin-activated A2M efficiently degrades A[beta] in vitro and prevents in vitro formation of thioflavin S-positive A[beta] fibrils as well as A[beta]-induced toxicity of cultured human cortical neuronal cells (6).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	21	After being activated, A2M is cleared by the A2M-r/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (A2M-r/LRP).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	22	 A2M-r/LRP is a multifunctional receptor and interestingly is also the primary neuronal apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor (7,8).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	23	 LRP also binds and clears the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor containing isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (9).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Thus A2M potentially impacts both apoE and APP metabolism in the brain.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	25	Because of these biological links to Alzheimer's disease, we studied the possible association of a previously reported polymorphism in the A2M gene with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	26	 (10) screened 30 normal and 30 pulmonary disease patients for A2M polymorphisms at or near the active site and reported three A2M polymorphisms.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The most common occurred 25 amino acids downstream from the thiolester site, interchanging Val1000 (GTC) and Ile1000 (ATC) (10).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	28	 (Numbering is based on the cDNA sequence which includes a 24 amino acid signal peptide; this corresponds to Val/Ile976 in the mature protein.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	29	) Allele frequencies in their 60 probands were 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	30	 No difference in A2M serum levels was associated with the two alleles.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This polymorphism is especially interesting because it has the potential to be biologically relevant to the function of A2M as a proteinase inhibitor because it occurs near the thiolester active site of the molecule.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	32	Our initial exploratory experiment tested the possibility that the less common form of A2M (the `G' allele) would be associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Because of the potential for error due to multiple hypothesis testing, we planned to use the initial data set as an exploratory data set, with the intent to formulate specific hypotheses which would then be tested formally in a second independent data set.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We genotyped 90 non-Alzheimer's individuals who had either undergone screening tests with the Blessed dementia scale (11) or whose DNA had been isolated from autopsy material and were demonstrated to not have Alzheimer's disease and 171 individuals who either had a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or neuropathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (Table 1).

0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Power analysis showed that >500 Alzheimer's disease and control individuals would be necessary to have an 80% chance of showing a difference between genotype frequencies of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	47	 We therefore collected cases and controls from several sites in order to approximate this number of samples.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The second data set consisted of individuals who met the same criteria for Alzheimer's disease or control as the hypothesis generating set and were derived from sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients in Massachusetts, from three European centers and from probands of a multicenter US study of sib pairs and small families.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The results from the second data set supported the hypothesis, with G/G genotype frequencies of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	50	12 in Alzheimer's disease (P  <  0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	51	05, Fisher's exact test) (Table 1).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The G allele was not over-represented in this data set (control = 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	53	 No difference in age of onset between G/G and non-G/G was found in the second data set.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Multivariate analysis showed that site of collection did not influence genotype frequencies.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	55	 We also compared the rate in controls to the subset of 387 clinic-based Alzheimer's disease cases (G/G frequency = 11.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	56	06) and the subset of 179 familial Alzheimer's disease samples (G/G frequency = 12.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	57	056) and found essentially equal over-representation of G/G in each.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	58	 These data support an association of the G/G genotype with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	59	We then carried out a series of exploratory analyses using pooled data from all individuals (737 Alzheimer's disease patients and 449 controls).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The G/G genotype was present in 11.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	61	9% of the Alzheimer patients and 7.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The genotype frequency in controls was consistent with a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Age of onset was not different between Alzheimer's disease patients with G/G (70.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	64	2, mean  plus or minus  SD) and non-G/G carriers (70.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A multivariate logistic model that controlled for the presence of the APOE4 allele and gender showed an odds ratio of 1.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	66	01) for the presence of A2M G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The presence of APOE4 in this model was associated with an odds ratio of 4.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The odds ratio of the combination of G/G and APOE4 is 9.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	69	001) relative to those with neither risk factor.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	70	 To explore whether the G/G-mediated risk was influenced by the presence or absence of APOE4, we stratified the sample by the presence or absence of APOE4.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Similar over-representations of the G/G genotype were seen in the strata with or without APOE4, suggesting that the effects of the two risk factors are independent.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Multivariate analysis for interaction between the G/G genotype and either APOE4 or gender demonstrated no interactions (P > 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Analysis based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator suggested no heterogeneity of odds ratios between strata with and without APOE4 (P > 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	74	5), consistent with the absence of an interaction between A2M and APOE4 in our logistic regression model.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	75	We next turned our attention to possible biological effects of inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Our previous studies of A2M immunohistochemistry in Alzheimer brain suggested that SP in different cases stained with varying intensity (3).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	77	 We explored the possibility that this variability was due to different genotypes by immunostaining eight Alzheimer's disease cases known to be G/G or A/A genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In all instances, A2M immunoreactivity was present robustly on SP, astrocytes and neurons and no qualitative differences were observed between the genotype groups.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	79	We also explored what effect inheritance of the A2M G/G genotype had on the neuropathological phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (Table 2).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	80	 We have previously used stereological techniques and quantitative image analysis to measure the amount of A[beta] present (amyloid burden) in the neocortical association area surrounding the superior temporal sulcus and the number of neurofibrillary tangles present in the same region (12).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thirty one of these previously analyzed Alzheimer's disease cases were A2M genotyped and selected for further analysis.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Initial inspection of the data suggested an increase in A[beta] in individuals who were A/G or G/G, with no difference between these two groups.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A statistically significant increase in A[beta] deposition was seen when comparing the G-containing cases with the non-G-containing cases (8.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect appears to be primarily due to the presence of at least one G allele, in that no difference between A/G and G/G genotypes was observed, although our sample size limits the power of this comparison.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	85	 There were no statistically significant differences in neurofibrillary tangle number with G alleles, suggesting a specific effect on A[beta] deposition.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Neuropathological correlates of the A2M genotype Genotype n Amyloid burden (%) Neurofibrillary tangles ( x 103) A/A 10 6.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	87	Exploratory studies of genetic risk factors run the risk of type I errors because of the large number of hypotheses that are either explicitly or implicitly being tested.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Alternatively, type II errors can occur if sample size is insufficient.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In order to overcome some of the difficulties inherent in exploratory studies of genetic risk factors we used independent data sets to first generate, then test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is associated with Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Two separate control populations gave identical genotype frequencies; our hypothesis testing data set was itself made up of two groups (sporadic AD and probands from a multicenter study of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small families) each of which gave essentially identical genotype frequencies and over-representation of the G/G genotype.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The A2M G/G effect was not dependent on APOE genotype and the effect was additive and substantial: the odds ratio of G/G in the presence of an APOE4 allele showed an almost 10-fold increased risk.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Power analysis using the size of effect observed in our combined data set (using ~500 samples) suggests that a group size of 578 controls and 578 Alzheimer's disease patients would be necessary to have an [alpha] of 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	93	05 and a [beta] of 80% for the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is increased from 0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	94	The association of the G/G A2M genotype as a risk factor in Alzheimer's disease leads to several interesting mechanistic interpretations.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Previous data have shown that A2M immunostains SP and have implicated A2M in amyloid precursor protein metabolism (13) as well as possible interactions with binding of A[beta] (4) and mediation of degradation of A[beta] (5,6).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	96	 A2M-A[beta] complexes undergo endocytosis via the A2M-r/LRP receptor (14).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	97	 A2M associates with A[beta] and prevents fibril formation (15).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In addition, A2M can be viewed as a (sub)acute phase reactive molecule and as a potent proteinase inhibitor which might participate in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer brain.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Interestingly, A2M has also been implicated as a trophic factor, possibly as a result of binding and transporting a number of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (16).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like apoE, A2M may serve as a binding protein for targeting various bioactive molecules to their site of action or clearing them (3).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Finally, the fact that apoE and APP, two other ligands of the A2M-r/LRP receptor are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, support the plausibility of the idea that an A2M polymorphism might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In fact, a polymorphism in A2M-r/LRP itself has recently been reported in two studies to show a genetic association with Alzheimer's disease (17,18).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	103	Although there is a strong biological rationale for the involvement of an A2M polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease, the possibility remains that the genetic association we observe reflects linkage with another mutation or polymorphism either in the A2M gene itself or in a nearby gene on chromosome 12.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The A2M gene resides ~25 cM distal of the marker D12S1042, which yielded the maximal LOD score in a recent linkage study, suggesting that chromosome 12 contains an Alzheimer risk factor (19).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	105	 However, the likelihood that A2M itself is a risk factor is supported by the results of a recent separate study, in which we observed an association between an intronic (5[prime] splice site of exon 18) pentanucleotide deletion (allele 2) within the A2M gene and Alzheimer's disease in a sibship analysis of Alzheimer's disease sib pairs and small Alzheimer's disease families (20).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Our current results extend this observation by showing linkage of a missense mutation in a case-control sample rather than family-based association.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	107	 We are currently studying how the two A2M polymorphisms relate to one another; our preliminary results are consistent with the hypothesis that they act as independent risk factors.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Initial study of a group evaluated for both polymorphisms suggests that the G allele is inherited with the 1 allele; of 70 G chromosomes examined (35 G/G individuals), 97% were allele 1 and 3% were allele 2, compared with an allele 2 frequency of ~15% (P  <  0.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	109	005, [chi]2 analysis with Yate's correction).
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	110	Taken together, we believe that polymorphisms in the A2M gene may contribute to risk for Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Moreover, these data focus attention on mechanisms of pathophysiology that impact on A2M-r/LRP or its ligands, including clearance mechanisms mediated by A2M-r/LRP (7,14), and suggest that other A2M-r/LRP ligands may be candidate Alzheimer's disease genes as well.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	112	An initial hypothesis generating data set was established from 171 Alzheimer's disease patients with a clinical history of probable Alzheimer's disease and 90 age-compatible control individuals, who were primarily spouses of the patients.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	113	 A second hypothesis testing data set was collected from several sources in an attempt to approximate the >500 patients and controls estimated by power analysis to adequately test the hypothesis that the G/G genotype is over-represented in Alzheimer's disease.
0.2649917.9811940.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These individuals included additional cases of 380 sporadic Alzheimer disease and 337 controls matched for site (primarily cognitively tested spouses) collected from the Massachusetts General Hospital Memory Disorder Unit and from a consortium of European Centers (University of Hamburg, Germany, University of Basel, Switzerland and S.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To address this, we first examined the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a community-based controlled study, the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry (ADPR), which follows patients with Alzheimer disease versus control subjects without Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	7	 In addition to this clinical study, we performed a pathological study of autopsy cases from this same community to determine whether there is an increased prevalence of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease and increased prevalence of cerebral amyloid in patients with type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Patients who were enrolled in the ADPR (Alzheimer disease n = 100, non-Alzheimer disease control subjects n = 138) were classified according to fasting glucose concentration (FPG) as nondiabetic (FPG  < 110 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, FPG 110 to 125 mg/dl), and type 2 diabetes (FPG  > 126 mg/dl).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The mean slope of FPG over 10 years in each case was also compared between Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease control subjects.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Pancreas and brain were examined from autopsy specimens obtained from 105 humans (first, 28 cases of Alzheimer disease disease vs.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The slope of increase of FPG with age over 10 years was also greater in Alzheimer disease than non-Alzheimer disease control subjects (P  <  0.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Islet amyloid was more frequent (P  <  0.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	16	05) in patients with Alzheimer disease than in non-Alzheimer disease control subjects.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, diffuse and neuritic plaques were not more common in type 2 diabetes than in control subjects.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In cases of type 2 diabetes when they were present, the duration of type 2 diabetes correlated with the density of diffuse (P  <  0.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	19	001) and neuritic plaques (P  <  0.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In this community cohort from southeast Minnesota, type 2 diabetes and IFG are more common in patients with Alzheimer disease than in control subjects, as is the pathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes, islet amyloid.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, there was no increase in brain plaque formation in cases of type 2 diabetes, although when it was present, it correlated in extent with duration of diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These data support the hypothesis that patients with Alzheimer disease are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes and the possibility of linkage between the processes responsible for loss of brain cells and ss-cells in these diseases.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	23	The islet of Langerhans in type 2 diabetes is characterized by ss-cell loss (1,2) and islet amyloid derived from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (3 to 5), a protein coexpressed and secreted with insulin by ss-cells.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Brain dysfunction in Alzheimer disease is characterized by loss of neocortical neurons (6) and focal amyloid deposits, which consist of the locally expressed amyloid ss protein (AssP) (7 to 13).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The prevalence of both Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes increases with age, and both have genetic components (14 to 19).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	26	AssP and IAPP both spontaneously form into amyloid aggregates in an aqueous environment (7,8,20,21).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The role of these aggregates of IAPP and AssP in ss-cell and cortical neuronal death in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease is controversial.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Small amyloid aggregates of either of these proteins are cytotoxic (22 to 25).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The mechanism of the cytotoxicity mediated by small protein aggregates has been hypothesized to be by induction of membrane damage (25 to 27).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In the case of IAPP, evidence exists to suggest that abnormal aggregation occurs initially intracellularly, and after cell death, IAPP-derived fibrils accumulate extracellularly (24,28,29).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Similar mechanisms are also possible in Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In vivo, even though IAPP and AssP are present in an aqueous environment, in health neither protein forms fibrils, suggesting that mechanisms exist to prevent this otherwise spontaneous process.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	33	 These mechanisms likely include the chaperone protein pathway, a system for protein trafficking via intracellular binding proteins (chaperone proteins), which bind nascent proteins and facilitate their transport within the cell (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	34	We have previously hypothesized that IAPP amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes may occur under circumstances of genetic variance, which results in a relative decreased affinity of the chaperone protein pathway for trafficking of IAPP (31).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	35	 It is plausible that a low affinity for binding by one or more chaperone proteins to IAPP may be shared with a similar low affinity for binding to AssP.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In support of this hypothesis, Schwartz (32) suggested that there might be a relationship between amyloid deposits in the brain and pancreatic islets.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	37	We used both clinical studies (in living patients and community-based control subjects) and pathological studies to examine the existence of a shared risk for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In the clinical studies, we took advantage of a unique community-based (Olmsted County, MN) cohort of well-characterized patients with Alzheimer disease and control subjects without Alzheimer disease (33) to address the question, "Is type 2 diabetes more common in Alzheimer disease?" In the pathology studies, we studied brain and pancreas in autopsy cases from the same community to address the hypotheses 1) that islet amyloid is more frequent in patients with Alzheimer disease than in control subjects without Alzheimer disease and 2) that amyloid deposits are more common in the brain in patients with type 2 diabetes than in nondiabetic humans.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Patients who were from southeastern Minnesota and had dementia were identified at the time of routine general medical examination in the Department of Community Internal Medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	41	 All studies were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	42	 When there was a suspicion of Alzheimer disease during a routine periodic medical examination, a neurological evaluation that included the Mini-Mental State Exam, Geriatric Depression Scale, Hachinski Ischemic Scale, Short Test of Mental Status, Record of Independent Living, and extensive neuropsychological testing was performed (33).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Age- and sex-matched control subjects were randomly identified from the same community clinics.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	44	 All enrolled cases had detailed evaluation to confirm or rule out (control subjects) Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Once a patient had been enrolled in the ADPR as a case of Alzheimer disease or as a control, he or she was followed annually for clinical studies that included a fasting blood glucose measurement.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Recruitment to the ADPR was haphazard (i.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The features favoring type 1 diabetes included lean BMI (and further weight loss) and young age at onset, insulin requirement at onset, documented ketoacidosis, presence of other autoimmune diseases, and a family history of autoimmune disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Features favoring type 2 diabetes included strong family history, prolonged insulin-independent treatment, obesity, absence of autoimmune diseases, and later age of onset.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	52	 It is acknowledged that the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes is not without error, but in view of the large number of cases in the present studies and the high prevalence of type 2 versus type 1 diabetes, it is unlikely that the conclusions of the present studies have been influenced by erroneous inclusion of cases of type 1 diabetes (Table 1).

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In protocol 1, these cases and control subjects were classified according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association into one of three groups: nondiabetic ( <  110 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG; 110 to 125 mg/dl), and type 2 diabetes ( > 126 mg/dl) based on the most recent glucose concentration measurements.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Individuals who were taking blood glucose-lowering treatment for diabetes were classified as type 2 diabetes regardless of their most recent fasting glucose concentration.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	57	Protocol 2: is the increase in fasting plasma glucose with age greater in Alzheimer disease? We also examined the changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with aging in this cohort of patients.

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	142	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   We report that the prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and IFG are increased in a well-characterized community cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease from southeast Minnesota.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	143	 In the related pathology studies, we also report an increased frequency of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, brain amyloid was not increased in patients with type 2 diabetes versus non-type 2 diabetes, but the density of diffuse and neuritic plaques, when present, was associated with the duration of diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	145	The studies were initially undertaken to test the hypothesis that there may be a shared predisposition for development of islet amyloid and brain amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This postulate arose from the close resemblance in pathology in the brain in Alzheimer disease and islets in type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In both diseases, a locally expressed protein (AssP in Alzheimer disease and IAPP in type 2 diabetes) is deposited in amyloid deposits with a gradual decline in the number of cells of the respective proteins.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Amyloid deposits of both AssP and IAPP (or more likely their oligomeric precursors) are cytotoxic (22,23,35 to 40) by a mechanism that may relate to membrane disruption (25 to 27).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, as yet, there is still no clear explanation for why these amyloidogenic proteins form amyloid fibrils in those who develop type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Because both of these proteins spontaneously form amyloid fibrils in vitro in the aqueous environment present in the cell, mechanisms must exist in health to prevent this aggregation, which presumably include the chaperone protein pathway (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	151	 All newly synthesized proteins are bound by a chaperone protein that has the function of preventing insoluble proteins (e.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	152	, IAPP and AssP) from aggregating in cells and trafficking the protein to its appropriate subcellular location.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Chaperon proteins have been described as promiscuous because each chaperone protein binds and traffics numerous different proteins with structurally similar properties (30).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	154	 As individual chaperone proteins traffic structurally similar peptides, it is possible that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	155	 4, the amino acid sequence and structural properties of each amino acid of IAPP1 to 37 and AssP1 to 42 are shown.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	156	 They have been aligned to reveal the major overlap (90%) in structural properties of IAPP20 to 28 and AssP25 to 33, areas that are hydrophobic and therefore likely to be a target for binding by chaperone proteins.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Furthermore, this region of IAPP is well-established as the amyloidogenic sequence (36) and AssP25 to 35 is neurotoxic (41).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Recently it has been suggested that the toxic intermediate form of IAPP and AssP oligomers are recognized by the same antibody, suggesting a strong structural relationship (42).

0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	160	 The structural overlap between IAPP and AssP.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	161	 There is a major overlap (90%) in the structural properties of IAPP20 to 28 and AssP25 to 33 when the amino acids are classified as acidic (A), basic (B), nonpolar (NP), and polar uncharged (Pu).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Gray boxed and hatched areas are identical amino acids; gray boxed areas are amino acids with similar structural properties.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	163	  If the chaperone protein pathway for trafficking AssP or IAPP is shared, then any decreased capacity for trafficking of either might also be shared.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Under these circumstances, aggregation of either or both proteins might occur, resulting in the development of the relevant phenotype for Alzheimer disease and/or type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	165	 In addition, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease increase in prevalence with aging, and cell chaperone protein capacity declines with aging (43), which would be expected to reveal any partial deficiency in chaperone capacity with aging.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Therefore, one potential explanation for the reported shared risk for Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes and similar pathology is that IAPP and AssP share one or more chaperone proteins and that a functional defect in this shared pathway (decreased chaperone protein binding, decreased chaperone protein availability) results in a shared vulnerability for AssP to aggregate in ss-pleated sheets in cortical cells and IAPP to aggregate in ss-cells.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	167	An alternative hypothesis to account for the reported overlap between islet amyloid and brain amyloid is that subtle hyperglycemia causes Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This possibility has been reviewed by Finch and Cohen (44).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Finch and Cohen proposed that the progressive increase in plasma glucose concentration that occurs with aging in the general population may be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	170	 They proposed that this may be mediated by induction of oxidative stress or by glycosylation of key regulatory proteins (45,46).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The current study was at least partly supportive of this interesting hypothesis.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	172	 When present, the density of diffuse and neuritic plaques in brain increased with the duration of diabetes but not with age.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia thus might trigger brain plaque formation in those at risk.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	174	 However, against this hypothesis, there was not an overall increase in the pathological features of Alzheimer disease in cases of type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects, consistent with a previous pathological report (47).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	175	The high risk of underlying vascular disease in diabetes has been reported to increase rates of vascular dementia in diabetes (48,49).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Furthermore, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both strongly associated with diabetes (50), both are risk factors for vascular dementia (51 to 54).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Another potential mechanism for decreased cognitive function in long-standing diabetes is recurrent hypoglycemia (55 to 57).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	178	 However, in the present studies, we included only cases with type 2 diabetes in which recurrent hypoglycemia is rare in comparison with type 1 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	179	These multiple factors that might influence a relationship between dementia and type 2 diabetes as well as differences in populations and inclusion criteria likely contribute to the conflicting epidemiological data in this field.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Some studies suggest that the prevalence of Alzheimer disease is increased in type 2 diabetes (58 to 60), whereas in others, it has been reported as decreased (61 to 66) or comparable (48,49,67 to 71).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	181	 A confounding factor in these studies (including the current one) is that Alzheimer disease is often accompanied by a decreased BMI presumed to be a result of decreased food intake.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Because the most potent risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes is an increased BMI, it is possible that an association between these conditions has been obscured by the relative protective effect of a decreased BMI in Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Alternatively, it is possible that people with Alzheimer disease exercise less and therefore have decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk for type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	184	 As type 2 diabetes tends to develop at a younger age than Alzheimer disease and is associated with a decreased life expectancy, early death from complications of diabetes might obscure subsequent development of Alzheimer disease.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The current pathology studies are unique inasmuch as the Alzheimer disease and non-Alzheimer disease groups were fully characterized both in life and by autopsy, and so although the numbers are small, it is provocative that there is a distinct increase in risk of islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease despite a lower BMI.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The clinical data (protocols 1 and 2) are also community-based cases that have been defined extensively with respect to the presence or absence of dementia and followed over a relatively long term (33).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It is of interest that a population-based study from the same region showed an association between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (59).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Whereas the former study examined records of all known cases of type 2 diabetes in the Rochester area at the time of the study for a diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer disease (1,455 cases), the present study was focused on a much smaller cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease (100 cases) and control subjects (138 cases) enrolled in the ADPR (33), wherein the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease was rigorously established, and then the same patients were followed annually in the study thereafter and when deceased were included in the autopsy studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	189	 One other factor that might have caused discrepancies between reported studies is the changing definition of diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	190	 The present study uses the criteria adopted for FPG concentrations in 1997 by an expert committee convened by the American Diabetes Association (72).
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	191	 As a consequence of this report, the plasma glucose concentration required to establish the diagnosis of diabetes was decreased from 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Furthermore, a high-risk group was established for the subsequent development of diabetes with an FPG concentration of 110 to 125 mg/dl.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Studies that used the higher values for diagnosis of diabetes would report lower prevalence rates in both Alzheimer disease and control subjects and possibly not observe differences between groups that might be evident with the criteria used here.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	194	Another potential confounding factor in previous as well as the present studies is recruitment bias.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	195	 All studies performed at major tertiary referral centers such as the Mayo Clinic are subject to such bias.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Efforts were made to minimize this in the present clinical studies by recruitment of patients from the local community from the community clinics of the Mayo Medical Center.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Patients were therefore attending the Mayo Clinic community clinics for primary care when they were recruited for either the Alzheimer disease or control groups of the clinical studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Nonetheless, other recruitment bias may be introduced in a study such as ours by the failure of affected patients to seek medical care and therefore be unavailable for consideration.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In the present study, there is a greater proportion of women than men in the clinical studies, which might be in part a reflection of recruitment bias but also potentially be due to the shorter life span of men than women once Alzheimer disease is diagnosed.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Autopsy studies of Alzheimer disease cases and control subjects (for islet amyloid) would be subject to the same ascertainment bias as the ADPR since the cases were in the ADPR until death.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	201	 In autopsy studies of type 2 diabetes cases versus control subjects for brain amyloid, we sought to minimize deliberate bias by including most recent autopsies in reverse sequence from cases that were appropriate for inclusion for these criteria.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	202	 People who have an autopsy are of course in themselves a subgroup of the general population, so bias has to be considered.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Notwithstanding these limitations, we do have the opportunity of presenting autopsy data from cases that were well characterized in life compared with most autopsy studies.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	204	In conclusion, we report that there is an increased prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and IFG in a community cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease followed in Olmsted County, Rochester, Minnesota.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	205	 We also report increased islet amyloid in patients with Alzheimer disease compared with control subjects.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	206	 However, we did not observe an increased frequency of brain amyloid in cases of type 2 diabetes, although in cases of type 2 diabetes that did have brain amyloid, the extent of this amyloid increased with longer duration of diabetes, a correlate that did not extend to the age of patients with type 2 diabetes.
0.40214586.14747300.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Taken together, these clinical and pathological studies support a possible link between the neurodegenerative processes that lead to loss of cortical brain cells in Alzheimer disease and the loss of ss-cells in type 2 diabetes.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	6	Persyn is a recently identified member of the synuclein family with a distinct pattern of expression during pre- and postnatal development of the mouse peripheral and central nervous systems.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	7	 As with other synucleins, persyn is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, in contrast to other synucleins, high levels of persyn mRNA expression were also found in advanced breast carcinomas, suggesting an involvement of the encoded protein in breast tumour progression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Here we have used an antibody specific to human persyn to demonstrate that the level of this protein is increased in ageing cerebral cortex and in breast tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We cloned, characterized and sequenced the human persyn genomic locus and localized it to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Sequence information was used to search for specific mutations in the protein coding regions of persyn mRNA and the persyn gene in breast tumours and tumour cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	12	 No tumour-specific mutations were found, but two linked polymorphisms in the coding region were detected, both in mRNA and exons III and IV of the gene.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These results suggest that development of breast tumours correlates with overexpression of the wild-type persyn protein.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Detailed characterization of the human persyn locus is important for further studies of the involvement of persyn in neurodegeneration and malignancy.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	15	Three genes of the synuclein family have been recently identified in the human genome.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The first two code for [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins, which are closely related presynaptic proteins that have similar patterns of expression and are most abundant in evolutionarily recent regions of the central nervous system (1-5).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Both proteins are believed to be `natively unfolded' or random coiled (6,7) and tend to aggregate in solution, forming amyloid-like fibrils (8).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Another important feature of synucleins is their ability to bind and trigger aggregation of amyloid A[beta]-peptides (9-11).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	19	 These results, together with the detection of a peptide (NAC) derived from [alpha]-synuclein in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's brains (2,8), raise the possibility that synucleins are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (12).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although mutations or polymorphisms in synuclein genes have yet to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease (13,14), two point mutations of the human [alpha]-synuclein gene were found in several families with early onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (15,16).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	21	 These findings, together with the immunohistochemical detection of a high level of [alpha]-synuclein in Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease patient brains (17,18), implicates [alpha]-synuclein in the pathogenesis of certain forms of this neurodegenerative disorder.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	22	The most recently identified member of the synuclein family, persyn, shares all of the main structural features of [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins, but has a distinctive pattern of expression (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	23	 During mouse embryonic development, persyn is expressed only in primary sensory neurons and motoneurons.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Postnatally, persyn expression remains high in these neurons and becomes detectable in sympathetic neurons and a subset of neurons of the cerebral cortex.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In contrast to the decrease in [alpha]-synuclein expression in ageing cerebral cortex (20), persyn mRNA expression increases and persyn protein accumulates in the mouse cerebral cortex with age (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	26	Although persyn is not present in senile plaques, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles in any of the clinical cases studied so far, a high level of persyn immunoreactivity is detectable in dot-like structures which are characteristic axonal lesions in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (V.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Davies, submitted for publication).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These clinical findings are consistent with the developmental and regional patterns of persyn expression and with experimental evidence which suggests that persyn plays a role in regulating neurofilament network integrity (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	29	Persyn is nearly identical to a protein coded by an expressed sequence tag (EST), BCSG1, isolated from a breast cancer cDNA library (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Although BCSG1 mRNA cannot be detected in normal breast tissue and in benign breast tumours, its level dramatically increases in highly infiltrating malignant carcinomas (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	31	 If the level of the encoded protein reflects the level of persyn/BCSG1 mRNA, it could be useful as a breast cancer progression marker.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	32	The dual role of persyn in neurodegeneration and malignancy could involve common mechanisms.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Changes in organization of the cell cytoskeleton are among the most prominent characteristics of both processes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The involvement of persyn in regulating neurofilament network integrity raises the possibility that it may also affect the intermediate filament network in malignant breast epithelial cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	35	 An important question is whether breast tumour progression correlates with a high level of expression of wild-type persyn or the presence of mutations in the persyn coding region is an obligatory characteristic of this process.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Multiple differences (including three that resulted in amino acid substitutions) between BCSG1 isolated from tumour tissue and persyn isolated from normal brain tissue are consistent with the latter possibility.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Such mutations could be somatic or germline and might reflect advanced tumour progression or predisposition of an individual to malignant progression of a tumour.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	38	Clarification of these and other questions requires further study of the human persyn gene and persyn protein.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Here we report the organization of the human persyn locus, its chromosomal localization and studies of human persyn protein expression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We also show that there are no mutations in the persyn gene specific for breast tumours, all confirmed differences being the result of natural sequence polymorphisms.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	41	RESULTS Cloning and analysis of the human persyn genomic locus.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	42	Two human persyn cDNA clones have previously been isolated from a juvenile human cDNA library.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	43	 One of these cDNA clones (clone H1) was used to screen a human genomic library in [lambda]EMBL4 (22).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Two identical, independent clones were isolated from this genomic library and the positions of the exons were determined by restriction analysis, hybridization with cDNA and oligonucleotide probes, direct sequencing of the locus and genomic Southern hybridization.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Figure 1 shows that the human persyn gene consists of five exons that span ~5 kbp.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	46	 There were no differences between the sequence of cDNA clone H1 used to probe the genomic library and the exonic sequences of the genomic clones isolated.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	47	 However, in another shorter cDNA clone (4C) isolated from the same juvenile human cDNA library, two substitutions in the coding region were found (G->C at position 243 and T->A at position 377 of cDNA sequence AF017256, boxed in Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	48	 1), the latter resulting in the amino acid substitution Val110Glu.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Because the cDNA library was constructed from an individual juvenile brainstem, it is likely that these substitutions are the result of natural polymorphism of the persyn gene and that both alleles of the gene were transcriptionally active in this tissue.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	83	It has been shown previously by in situ hybridization that persyn/BCSG1 mRNA is not expressed in normal adult breast tissue, but high levels of this mRNA are present in advanced infiltrating breast tumours (21).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The other substitutions were not present in any of our clones and may be correlated with the transformed phenotype of the cells from which the BCSG1 EST was isolated.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	94	 To study the presence and frequency of these mutations of the persyn gene in breast cancer cells, we carried out RT-PCR of mRNAs isolated from breast tumours and tumour cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	95	 As a control, we used mRNA isolated from post-mortem cerebral cortices and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of normal donors.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The PCR amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases HphI, StyI and MnlI.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Using these digestions, four mutations in the coding region reported for BCSG1, including two polymorphisms present in cDNA clone 4C, could be detected.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	98	 In all studied samples, digestion with MnlI generated the same pattern of fragments (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	99	 5a), which corresponds to the pattern predicted from the sequence of the persyn clones.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Identical, predicted patterns were also obtained with StyI (not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	101	 These results reflect the absence of two G->A (and consequently Glu->Lys) substitutions reported for the BCSG1 EST in all studied tumour cell lines, tumours and control tissues.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In contrast, when RT-PCR products were digested with HphI, three types of fragment patterns were revealed (Fig.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The pattern represented in Figure 5a by the GI101 cell line corresponds to persyn transcripts with a sequence similar to H1 (G243, presence of HphI site, 120 bp but not 135 bp HphI fragment; T377, absence of HphI site, 155 bp but not 79 and 76 bp fragments).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The pattern of MCF7[prime] in Figure 5a corresponds to persyn transcripts with a sequence similar to 4C (C243, absence of HphI site, 135 bp but not 120 bp HphI fragment; A377, presence of HphI site, 79 and 76 bp but not 155 bp fragment).

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	115	These data were confirmed by PCR amplification of individual exons of the persyn gene followed by digestion of the products with the restriction endonucleases HphI, StyI and MnlI.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	116	 No polymorphic StyI and MnlI sites were found, but as illustrated in Figure 5b, the expected polymorphic HphI sites were present in exons three (G243C) and four (T377A) of the human persyn gene.

0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	128	Members of the synuclein family have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases (12,19,23-25).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In some families with a hereditary form of Parkinson's disease, a point mutation in the gene coding for [alpha]-synuclein is believed to be responsible for development of the pathology (15,26,27).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	130	 This finding suggests that mutations in the genes encoding members of the synuclein family could be linked to neurodegenerative conditions and underlies the need for further studies of these genes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	131	We cloned and defined the structure of the human gene encoding persyn, a recently identified member of the synuclein family (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The general organization of this gene in terms of the positions of the exon-intron junctions and the size of introns is very similar to that of the mouse persyn gene (unpublished data).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Although the complete structures of the other genes of the synuclein family have not been published, the available sequence data (15) and deduction of the positions of some of the exon-intron junctions from known splice variants of [alpha]- and [beta]-synucleins (1,4,19) suggest close similarities in organization of all synuclein genes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	134	In addition to its potential involvement in neurodegeneration, persyn is possibly involved in breast tumour progression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	135	 It has been shown that expression of an EST (BCSG1) that is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to persyn mRNA is increased dramatically in infiltrating breast cancers compared with normal breast tissues and benign tumours (21).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	136	 We have shown that expression of persyn protein also follows this pattern: no persyn could be detected by western blotting in normal breast tissues, whereas persyn protein was detectable in breast tumour tissue.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	137	 In established breast cancer cell lines, the levels of persyn protein expression were found to be substantially different and correlated with levels of persyn mRNA.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	138	 We did not find amplification of the persyn gene in the studied cell lines (data not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	139	 These observations suggest that persyn expression is regulated predominantly at the level of persyn gene transcription and/or persyn mRNA stability.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Thus, breast cancer cell lines could be used for further studies of the mechanisms that regulate persyn expression and to investigate the physiological consequences of persyn overexpression.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	141	 We have shown previously that experimental overexpression of persyn in cultured sensory neurons leads to dramatic changes in the neurofilament network (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	142	 It will be interesting to see if acute overexpression of persyn has a similar effect on the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Our immunocytochemical data suggest that persyn could be associated with membranous structures in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	144	 However, subcellular fractionation of neural tissues and breast cancer cells demonstrated the presence of persyn in cytosolic but not in particulate fractions (data not shown).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	145	 These results are similar to results obtained in studies of [alpha]-synuclein, which is believed to be very loosely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in presynaptic terminals (5,28-30).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	146	 This is interesting in the light of the recent demonstration that [alpha]-synuclein is able to bind synthetic membranes in vitro.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	147	 This association dramatically changes the protein secondary structure from natively unfolded to predominantly [alpha]-helical and perhaps alters the functional features of the protein (31).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	148	 One of these features is the ability of both [alpha]- and [beta]-synuclein to inhibit phospholipase D2 (32).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This inhibition is dependent on the bulk lipid concentration in the reaction, suggesting that interaction with the enzyme occurs on the membrane surface (32) and thus involves [alpha]-helical but not natively unfolded synucleins.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	150	 As phospholipase D2 is implicated in various intracellular pathways, including regulation of cell growth and differentiation, it will be interesting to study the effect of persyn on the activity of this enzyme in neurons and tumour cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	151	Substantial changes in persyn expression not only accompany breast tumour progression but also take place during nervous system development.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In our current study we have shown that persyn is not expressed in human fetal cerebral cortex but is abundant in cerebral cortices of elderly individuals.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	153	 This is consistent with our previous observation that persyn expression is increased in ageing mouse cerebral cortex (19).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We did not observe substantial differences in the levels of persyn protein in cerebral cortices of patients that suffered from Alzheimer's disease and normal age-matched individuals.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	155	 These results are in agreement with immunohistochemical data that implicate persyn in the axonal pathology of neurodegenerative conditions (dot-like structures in white matter) without significant changes in persyn immunoreactivity in cortical neurons (V.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Davies, submitted for publication).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	157	The important question is whether wild-type or mutated persyn protein is expressed in breast tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Sequence analysis suggests that the protein from tumour cells (BCSG1) is different from the protein expressed in the nervous system (cDNA clones H1 and 4C) and that coded by the genomic clone W6H.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Substitution of two lysines by glutamates in BCSG1 changes the overall charge of the persyn molecule and disturbs EKTKEGV repeats that are highly conserved in the synuclein family.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Such changes should have serious consequences for protein structure and function.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, the fact that BCSG1 is only an EST generated by RT-PCR amplification raises the question of how accurately the sequence of this clone reflects the sequence of the mRNA in tumour cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	162	 We studied a number of breast tumours and tumour cell lines for the presence of mutations that underlie Lys->Glu amino acid substitutions in the human persyn sequence.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Although both persyn mRNA and exons of the persyn gene were analysed by MluI and StyI digestion of PCR products, no such mutations were found in any of the studied tissues or cell lines.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	164	 In contrast, using HphI digestion, we were able to detect two nucleotide polymorphisms that had been initially recognized as sequence differences between persyn cDNA clones H1 and 4C.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	165	 These two linked polymorphic sites discriminate two alleles of the human persyn gene.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Both alleles are transcriptionally active and are expressed with similar efficiency in heterozygotes.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	167	 We did not find any obvious correlation between the presence of particular persyn alleles and pathological phenotype.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Although a limited number of samples were analysed, the two alleles in breast tumours and tumour cell lines occur with the same frequencies as in normal cells.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	169	 These data suggest that, at least in spontaneous breast tumours, the high level of wild-type persyn protein correlates with malignant phenotype and that the reported mutations in the BCSG1 EST are artefactual and may be the result of Taq polymerase errors.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	170	We have mapped the human persyn gene to the long arm of chromosome 10 in the q23.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	171	 A few hereditary disorders for which affected genes are not yet known have been located in this locus.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Taking into account the pattern of persyn expression in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system and motoneurons of the central nervous system, it will be interesting to check the possible involvement of the persyn gene in infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia with sensory neuropathy (IOSCA, SCA8) (33).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Also, it is intriguing that the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 10q23 occurs at high frequency in different human tumours.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene, which is located in the region, have been implicated in many breast carcinomas and germline mutations of this gene are believed to be associated with Cowden disease, a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome with a high risk of breast cancer (34).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, not all families and individuals with Cowden disease have mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene; somatic mutations of this gene occur in only a small fraction of primary breast cancers and LOH in breast cancers does not necessarily involve the PTEN/MMAC1 locus (35-37).
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Because of the correlation between persyn expression and breast tumour progression it will be interesting to search for mutations in the coding and regulatory regions of this gene in hereditary and spontaneous forms of breast cancer.
0.227683.9700196.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Defining the organization of the human persyn gene reported here is an important step towards genetic studies of the involvement of this gene in neurodegenerative and neoplastic disorders.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, July 27, 2005 , and in revised form, September 12, 2005.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Several epidemiological studies indicate that moderate consumption of wine is associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Wine is enriched in antioxidant compounds with potential neuroprotective activities.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	5	 However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of wine intake on the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease brain remain to be clearly defined.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Here we show that resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring polyphenol mainly found in grapes and red wine, markedly lowers the levels of secreted and intracellular amyloid- (A) peptides produced from different cell lines.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Resveratrol does not inhibit A production, because it has no effect on the A-producing enzymes - and -secretases, but promotes instead intracellular degradation of A via a mechanism that involves the proteasome.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Indeed, the resveratrol-induced decrease of A could be prevented by several selective proteasome inhibitors and by siRNA-directed silencing of the proteasome subunit 5.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	9	 These findings demonstrate a proteasome-dependent anti-amyloidogenic activity of resveratrol and suggest that this natural compound has a therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease (AD)2 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to the most common form of dementia.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Compelling evidence supports the central role of A in the pathogenesis of the disease (1).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	12	 A is a core component of the senile plaque, a classical lesion found in the neocortex and hippocampus of AD brains, and excessive production of the highly insoluble 42-amino acid-long A42 peptide is almost invariably observed in the presence of mutations in the three genes linked to early onset autosomal dominant familial forms of AD (2).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	13	In the amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid- precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by the aspartic protease -secretase/BACE1 to yield the membrane-anchored C-terminal fragments C99 and C89.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	14	 C99 is then endoproteolyzed by the -secretase proteolytic complex to produce various A peptides.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The major cleavage takes place after Val-40 producing A40.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In an alternative nonamyloidogenic pathway, APP is endoproteolyzed within the A region by -secretase to generate the C-terminal fragment C83 and the soluble N-terminal fragment secreted APP.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Finally, a -secretase-mediated -cleavage of APP allows the intracellular release of the transcriptionally active APP intracellular domain (AID (3) or AICD) (4 to 6).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	18	Epidemiological studies have shown that moderate wine intake reduces the risk of developing AD (7 to 10).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Resveratrol, a polyphenol that occurs in abundance in grapes and red wine, is suspected to afford antioxidant and neuroprotective properties and therefore to contribute to the beneficial effect of wine consumption on the neurodegenerative process (11 to 13).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Here we report that resveratrol has a potent anti-amyloidogenic activity by reducing the levels of A produced from different cell lines expressing wild type or Swedish mutant APP695.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	21	 We show that resveratrol acts by promoting the intracellular degradation of A by a mechanism that implicates the proteasome.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	113	 To this end, we treated APP695-transfected HEK293 cells with increasing concentrations of the different polyphenols and analyzed A levels by ELISA and WB.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Together with the observation that resveratrol did not affect the levels of APP holoprotein and its C-terminal proteolytic fragments, these data indicate that resveratrol did not target an A-producing activity but rather promoted A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	164	Based on these observations, we aimed to determine whether resveratrol treatment promotes A degradation.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	165	 A peptides are degraded in vivo by at least four metalloendopeptidases, NEP, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and -2 (ECE-1 and -2), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (17).

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Because phosphoramidon also inhibits ECE-1 and -2, we concluded that these enzymatic activities were also not involved in the resveratrol-mediated decrease of A.

0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Consistent with this conclusion, levels of -catenin, a cytosolic protein degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (25), are not affected by resveratrol in HEK293 cells (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	195	We then investigated the anti-amyloidogenic effect of several resveratrol analogues.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Three analogues were tested: piceatannol (trans-3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene), which contains an additional hydroxyl group at C-3, and two methoxy analogues, trimethoxy-resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trimethoxystilbene) and TMS.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Interestingly, the three analogues were able to decrease A levels (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	198	 However, compared with resveratrol (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	199	 2A), piceatannol and trimethoxy-resveratrol were less potent, whereas TMS had a very comparable potency in reducing the amounts of A (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	200	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Our data show that resveratrol strongly reduces A produced by different cell lines expressing wild type or Swedish mutant APP695.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Resveratrol acts by promoting the intracellular degradation of the amyloid peptide by a mechanism that implicates the proteasome.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Pharmacological studies show that none of the previously reported A-degrading metalloendopeptidases, NEP, ECE-1 and -2, or IDE, are involved in this clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Finally, we demonstrate the anti-amyloidogenic activity of two methoxy analogues of resveratrol, trimethoxy-resveratrol and TMS, suggesting that chemical modifications of resveratrol can be done in the context of improving its potency, stability, and bioavailability and therefore its therapeutic use.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	204	Additional studies will be needed to fully elucidate the role of the proteasome in this mechanism of intracellular clearance of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	205	 A number of possible functions of the proteasome in the regulation of A metabolism have been ascribed to the multicatalytic complex (22).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The proteasome targets for degradation C99 and three core components of the -secretase complex, presenilins, APH-1, and Pen-2 (22), suggesting that proteasome activation may decrease A levels by reducing the amounts of C99 available and by altering -secretase activity.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	207	 Our data show no reduction of C99 levels (Fig.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	208	 3A, panel c) or alteration of the -secretase-mediated cleavages of APP or N-cadherin upon resveratrol treatment (Figs.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	209	 3 and 4), thus excluding the possibility that resveratrol lowers A by promoting the proteasomal degradation of C99 or any -secretase components.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Recent evidence also suggests that A can be degraded by a proteasome-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (26).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Using cell-free reconstitutions of ER-derived brain microsomes, Schmitz et al.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	212	 (26) show that A can translocate from the ER to the cytosol where it is directly degraded by the proteasome.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It is conceivable that resveratrol promotes such a clearance mechanism.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	214	 However, because ER A represents a small fraction of total A produced and because a small pool of A produced in the ER appears to be controlled by ER-associated degradation, it is unlikely that the severe reduction of A levels observed in the presence of resveratrol is entirely due to an increase of this clearance mechanism.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	215	 We therefore hypothesize that resveratrol may act indirectly by selectively stimulating the proteasomal degradation of yet to be identified critical regulators of A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	216	It will be also important to determine what the molecular targets of resveratrol are in the pathway of A clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Resveratrol interacts with several proteins, including members of the sirtuin family.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved deacetylases with important functions in longevity (27).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Resveratrol was found to act as a potent activator of the human sirtuin SIRT1 in vitro and of the yeast homologue Sir2 in vivo, a mechanism that may extend life span in yeast (28).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Moreover, resveratrol and SIRT1 activation have recently been linked to neuroprotective pathways in models of axonal degeneration (29) and of neuronal dysfunctions caused by mutant polyglutamines (30).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	221	 It would therefore be of interest to determine whether SIRT1 is involved in the resveratrol-induced decrease of A.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	222	Evidence is compelling that a decrease in proteasome activity occurs in AD brains (31, 32).
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	223	 It is unclear, however, whether this decrease in proteasome activity is in parallel with an increase in A levels.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	224	 It has been proposed that A itself may lead to proteasome inhibition (33), suggesting that high levels of A in AD brain may create a vicious cycle by inhibiting the proteasome and blocking the degradation of critical regulators of its own clearance.
0.2674377.16162502.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In this context, our data reveal an important mechanism of selective proteasome activation in the anti-amyloidogenic effect of resveratrol and support the therapeutic potential of this natural polyphenol.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	6	   Abstract Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) plays an important role in the cellular metabolism of insulin.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Recent studies have also suggested a regulatory role for this protein in controlling the activity of cytoplasmic protein complexes, including the proteasome [multicatalytic proteinase (MCP)] and the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Binding of IDE to these complexes increases their activity, whereas the addition of substrates for IDE inhibits activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	9	 This provides a potential mechanism of action for internalized insulin and other IDE substrates in the control of protein turnover.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	10	 To examine further the interactions, partially purified IDE-MCP complex was treated with EDTA or EGTA, and activity was measured in the absence and presence of various divalent cations (Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+) and insulin.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	11	 EDTA treatment reduced MCP activity and eliminated the effect of insulin on the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Divalent cations partially or completely restored MCP activity, but did not restore the effect of insulin.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	13	 EGTA treatment had a lesser effect on MCP activity, but abolished insulin inhibition of activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Divalent cations restored the insulin effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Inhibitors of IDE also blocked the insulin effect on MCP activity, as did treatment with SDS.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These findings suggest that conformational changes in the complex may play a role in the insulin control of MCP activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	17	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   INSULIN-DEGRADING enzyme (IDE; EC 3.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	18	56), is an intracellular protein with binding, regulatory, and degradative functions.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In vitro, its most characteristic function is proteolytic activity, with a relatively high specificity for insulin, thus leading to its name (1).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Although insulin is the substrate with the highest affinity, IDE also degrades a number of other peptides and hormones, including glucagon (2), insulin-like growth factor II (3), atrial natriuretic peptide (4), and transforming growth factor- (5).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	21	 It is not a general proteinase, because it does not degrade a wide variety of other similarly sized peptides, and no specific amino acid sequence is required for proteolysis (2).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	22	 These findings have led to the conclusion that IDE recognizes a three-dimensional structure for binding and degradation (5, 6).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The requirement for a specific ligand structure is reflected in the binding properties of IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This protein binds proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and epidermal growth factor with high affinities, but has little degrading activity toward them (7).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In fact, IDE was first identified in Drosophila by its binding properties and was considered a new intracellular growth factor receptor (8).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	26	The regulatory properties of IDE are a relatively new finding.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	27	 IDE associates with and activates the cytosolic glucocorticoid and androgen receptors (9, 10).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	28	 IDE also complexes with the proteasome and regulates its activity (11).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Substrates that bind to IDE, including insulin and the various growth factors, inhibit proteasome activity when IDE is complexed with multicatalytic proteinase (MCP), but not after separation of the two proteins (12, 13).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, insulin inhibits proteasome activity toward an artificial substrate in intact cells (14).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This has led to the hypothesis that intracellular actions of insulin and other growth factors on cellular protein turnover are due to interactions with IDE and inhibition of proteolysis by the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	32	IDE is a metalloenzyme containing Zn2+ and possibly Mn2+ (15), and its degradative activity requires one or more divalent cations (7).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	33	 In addition to Zn2+ and Mn2+, Ca2+ has been shown to affect the degradative activity of IDE in vitro and in intact cells (16, 17).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	34	 As Ca2+ and other divalent cations have been implicated in some of the activities of insulin (18), the present study is directed at examination of IDE s binding, regulatory, and degradative functions, with special emphasis on the effect of metals.

0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	140	 Although all of insulin-sensitive tissues contain the enzyme, it is also found in noninsulin-sensitive tissues and in multiple subcellular compartments.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	141	 IDE is found in peroxisomes (25, 26, 27), cytosol (7), and endosomes (28) and on plasma membranes (29).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	142	 The cellular content of IDE is developmentally regulated, and IDE has been implicated in cellular differentiation (26, 30, 31, 32) and in growth factor binding (30).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	143	 These diverse properties become less confusing if IDE is recognized as a multifunctional protein that can complex with a variety of subcellular components (proteasome, steroid receptor, and peroxisomes) and alter the activities of these complexes.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	144	The stimulatory effects of IDE on proteasomes and the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors are established by the present and previous reports (9, 12), but the mechanism is not.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	145	 The reversible nature of the activation argues against proteolytic activation of the complex by IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Other possibilities include conformational changes in the complex, IDE degradation of the ligand, proteolytic products generated by IDE, or some combination of these.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	147	The present study provides evidence that divalent cations are involved in the activity and control of the IDE-MCP complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Treatment of the partially purified enzyme with EDTA significantly reduced the activity of IDE, which can be restored by the addition of Ca2+ with as little as 10-6 M.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	149	 This effect is presumably mediated by removal of the Zn2+ found at the active site of IDE, which is required for activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	150	 This treatment also reduces the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome and eliminates the ability of insulin to inhibit these activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	151	 The addition of Ca2+ or Co2+ restores the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities, but fails to restore the insulin responsiveness.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Zn2+ and Mn2+ show relatively little effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	153	We also examined the effect of EGTA on the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	154	 EGTA has a slightly higher affinity (2.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	155	5 times) for Ca2+ than does EDTA, but has 10 to 10,000 times less affinity for other cations (including Zn2+) (21).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Under the conditions of these experiments, EGTA had no effect on IDE activity (data not shown), but did reduce the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and effectively eliminated the insulin effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	157	 A similar reduction was seen with trypsin-like activity, although it did not reach statistical significance.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Insulin s ability to inhibit was restored by some of the cations (Ca2+ and Co2+).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	159	 These data suggest that there are two metals involved in the complex, as we have reported previously (15).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	160	We propose that one metal, zinc, is tightly bound to IDE, and is essential for its activity, and the other, possibly Mn2+ or Ca2+, is more loosely bound and is required for the productive interaction of IDE and the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	161	 EDTA can chelate the tightly bound Zn2+ and the more loosely bound metal associated with the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	162	 This inhibits IDE, thereby lessening its stimulatory effect on the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Loss of the Zn2+ molecule causes a conformational change in IDE, dissociating it from the proteasome and disrupting the ability of insulin to alter proteasome activity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Readdition of divalent cation restores IDE activity, but because it is no longer part of the complex, IDE cannot alter proteasome function.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, EGTA only has effects on the more loosely bound metal and disrupts IDE s ability to affect chymotrypsin-like activity, but does not cause IDE to dissociate from the complex.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Thus, addition of cations can restore insulin sensitivity.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	167	The fact that IDE must be active and in a complex with the proteasome to mediate its regulatory effects is further supported by the data presented in Tables 1 and 2.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Agents that inhibit IDE lessen proteasome activity and effectively eliminate insulin s inhibitory effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	169	Finally, we studied the IDE proteasome interactions using SDS, which has been shown to alter proteasome conformation.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	170	 7, the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome are insulin sensitive in the absence of SDS, but lose both sensitivity and considerable activity at 0.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Presumably, this is due to SDS altering the interaction between IDE and the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	172	 At higher concentrations, SDS further alters the conformation of the proteasome and stimulates the chymotrypsin-like and peptidyl glutamyl-degrading activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, at these high concentrations, IDE is still unable to interact with the proteasomes, and insulin does not inhibit.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	174	The data presented here characterize and further support the idea that IDE can serve as a regulator of the proteasome.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Metal ions play important roles in this interaction.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	176	 First, IDE is a metalloproteinase and must be active for insulin s inhibitory effect.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Further, a second, more loosely bound divalent cation is required for IDE to mediate its effects.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Changes in protein conformation are important, as illustrated by the loss of activity when IDE has its active site metal removed, and by changes in activity induced by SDS.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	179	The physiological effect of insulin is to inhibit cellular protein degradation, with greater effects during catabolic states (e.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	180	 starvation, diabetes, and traumatic stress).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	181	 As cell survival requires continued protein turnover, it would not be expected that insulin could totally inhibit MCP activity or completely block protein degradation.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Rather, the IDE-MCP interaction may serve as an activator of basal cellular protein degradation, analogous to activation of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors by IDE (9), with insulin and other substrates then acting to inhibit the stimulated process.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Thus, selective effects on cellular protein degradation in insulin-sensitive cells are under the control of insulin-IDE interactions.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	184	 MCP comprises a relatively large proportion of the protein in many cells (up to 1%), and IDE, although expressed at high levels in some tissues (33), is not present in sufficient quantities in all tissues to be a universal regulator of all of MCP s activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Our results show that insulin substantially inhibits only two of the activities of MCP, the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	186	 The proteasome may have as many as five different proteolytic activities (34).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	187	 It also remains to be determined whether the degradation of ubiquitinylated proteins is inhibited by insulin through IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	188	Although not widely appreciated, many studies have shown biological activity of intracellular insulin (35, 36) and alterations in insulin activity with inhibition of cellular insulin processing (37, 38).
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Our recent studies have provided a potential mechanism for these previously unexplained observations.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	190	 In this scheme, the IDE portion of the complex acts as an intracellular receptor for insulin and possibly other growth factors.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The insulin-IDE interaction then alters activity of the protein complex (i.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	192	 MCP, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, and perhaps others) and contributes to the biological actions of insulin.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The insulin effect on MCP can be prevented by altering the activity of IDE.
0.2582762.9751483.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Although speculative, cellular activity regulated by the IDE complexes may be affected by cellular redox state and divalent cation distribution due to changes in IDE.

0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	4	The boundaries between non-pathological brain ageing and the dementias are unclear and contentious.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Neuropathological examination can detect occasional individuals in whom the microscopic features typical of late-onset Alzheimer's disease are present yet a clinical history of dementia is absent.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	6	 On other occasions, the converse seems true: individuals seriously disabled in life by dementia show at death only mild pathological features of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Observations of this type, although often made by experienced neuropathologists, are not widely discussed by molecular neurobiologists, among whom the assumption has largely prevailed that Alzheimer's disease is a well-validated nosological entity, discontinuous with ageing and with its own discrete molecular pathology.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This reasoning extends to the repeated proposition that understanding the pathogenesis of amyloid deposition will provide a sound and sufficient basis from which to develop novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease (Selkoe, 1999).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	9	Findings from the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC-CFAS) now challenge these assumptions on at least two fronts.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	10	 First, they encourage dementia researchers to re-examine the basis for the belief that there are valid boundaries between non-pathological ( normal ) ageing in the absence of dementia and the dementias.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Second, they suggest that the central role often assigned to amyloid deposition requires review.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Longitudinal follow-up studies such as the MRC-CFAS raise important issues about the nature of the phenomena to be explained.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	13	 This editorial considers the early contributions to brain development as influences on cognitive decline in later life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In turn, this approach requires a deeper understanding than is as yet available of those brain mechanisms and processes most affected by ageing.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	15	Until Margaret Esiri and her colleagues (Esiri et al, 2001) described their large community-based neuropathological study of the distinction between dementia and brain ageing in the absence of dementia, there was a shortage of data.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It was impossible to accept the validity of contemporary neuropathological criteria for dementia, or the definitions of the boundary, if any, that existed between the dementias and  normal  ageing.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The study showed that in 209 old people weighted to contain 100 people who met clinical criteria for dementia before death, the majority showed mixed Alzheimer and vascular pathologies.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	18	 At postmortem examination the brains of dementia and non-dementia subjects overlapped in neuritic and diffuse plaque density and no single pathological criterion reliably distinguished between groups.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Coexistent vascular lesions did not provide sufficient explanation for the presence of dementia, but did encourage the view that interactions between Alzheimer and vascular pathologies may be critical determinants of progression to clinical dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	20	The MRC-CFAS data provide the strongest evidence yet that the relationship between  normal  brain ageing and the dementias is best represented by a continuum.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	21	 They also do much to weaken the pivotal position claimed for amyloid deposition in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Without the inclusion of some other factor or factors, the  amyloid cascade  hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is no longer tenable.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The MRC-CFAS programme may yet identify such factors.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Not until their sample size has more than doubled and there are improved descriptions and quantifications of vascular lesions will it be possible to begin to disentangle the pathological processes that contribute to clinical presentations of dementia and, critically, to establish their true relationships with age.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	25	RATE OF COGNITIVE CHANGE OR  CASENESS .
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	26	Longitudinal psychological studies of cognitive ageing do not identify a single point of transition between  normal  ageing and dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	27	 When several cognitive domains are used to predict later onset of dementia, cognitive decline is typically non-uniform across those domains, with the exception of early memory impairment   largely because of its inclusion among criteria for dementia (Chen et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	28	 These presymptomatic patterns of cognitive decline are not reliably distinguished from  normal  variation in cognitive function in late life, almost half of which is attributable to original childhood IQ (Deary, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	29	Psychologists and psychiatrists alike are familiar with problems of this type and are comfortable with a search for antecedents that may extend into earlier developmental epochs.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Links between increased late-life dementia risk and lower educational attainment suggest the association between dementia and childhood IQ reported by Whalley et al (2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Explanations of associations of this type are complex and not mutually exclusive.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Not least are the strong intergenerational and lifelong continuities of material advantage, which award entry to a safer, healthier environment to the mentally more able youngster.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	33	 More usual is the concept that the mature brain possesses sufficient  reserve  (or redundancy) to withstand age-related pathologies as described by Esiri et al (2001) and that this reserve is determined by early life experiences.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The belief that childhood educational attainment or mental ability could determine a threshold which brain ageing or dementia pathology must be sufficient to exceed to cause dementia was supported by the data reported by Whalley et al (2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The association between lower childhood IQ and dementia was confined to late-onset cases and was most marked in those presenting after age 72 years.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	36	The MRC-CFAS programme represents the successful application of epidemiological and neuropathological methods to the study of distinctions between clinical cases and non-cases, and the ages at which disease onset does (or does not) occur.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	37	 It is the most usual contemporary approach to age-related disease, where the disease of interest (in this case dementia) is defined as present or absent.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	38	 It contrasts with a second and potentially more powerful research method, which investigates the rate of change in premorbid characteristics over a specified age interval (National Institute of Aging Working Group on Aging and Genetic Epidemiology, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Here, risk factors for dementia are examined not simply as contributing to duration of survival up to becoming a  case  of dementia, but as possible determinants of rate and timing of change in parameters believed to be closely linked to the pathogenesis of dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	40	Age-related abnormalities of glucose metabolism are just one of these hypothetical parameters.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for stroke and a possible risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (Luchsinger et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Matureonset (type 2) diabetes is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors that include hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, which may cause or accelerate unrecognised progressive cerebrovascular disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	43	 There are at least two plausible biological mechanisms to link enduring age-related abnormalities in glucose metabolism with neuronal death: the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs); and hyperinsulinaemia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Separate strands of evidence link foetal growth, adult hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance at age 64 years (Hales et al, 1991).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Taken together, these observations advocate longitudinal studies on individual differences in glucose metabolism and age-related cognitive variation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	46	 When studies of this type extend across the life span, they are subsumed under the title  life course approaches  to late-onset dementia and dementia-associated traits.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	47	 They sometimes suggest parallel experimental routes to better understanding of mechanisms of age-related cognitive impairment (Strachan et al, 1997).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	48	Explanations of associations between suboptimal foetal and infant growth and late-onset disease include failure to acquire lasting control of complex central regulatory systems.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In brain development, foetal nutritional and hormonal environments are also important because of their critical roles in the expression of specific genes (Dauncey et al, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Major differences in the foetal and infant nutritional environment induce large differences in expression of hormonal receptor isoforms and may provide the means whereby dietary micro-nutrients affect cognitive functions across the life span.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Nutritional influences can be as apparently diverse as the contributions of folate and vitamin B12 to neurodevelopment and the greater age-related cognitive impairment linked to dietary and plasma folate concentrations (Miller, 2000; Duthie et al, 2002).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	52	Diversity in timing and nature of single nutritional influences represents an important obstacle when taking a life course approach to understanding dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	53	 It can obscure the best route to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which early nutritional experience affects neurodevelopment and later cognitive performance.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	54	 For example, observational studies in late life suggest hyperhomocysteinaemia (attributed to reduced transformation of homocysteine to methionine by folate and vitamin B12) as a possible risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (Miller, 2000) and dementia (Seshadri et al, 2002).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Polymorphisms in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, an enzyme essential to folate metabolism) are, therefore, possible susceptibility factors for age-related cognitive decline; however, they possess the potential to influence brain metabolism throughout life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Similar critiques can be made of studies of interactions between genes and early nutrition.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	57	 These may be as specific as their influences on peripheral insulin sensitivity and neuro-development, when the same factors might influence synaptogenesis in late life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	58	BRAIN AGEING AND COGNITIVE DECLINE.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	59	The association between brain ageing and age-related cognitive decline is uncertain.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Largely because ageing studies are only just beginning, brain ageing is yet to be linked informatively to what is known about the neurobiological basis of cognitive decline.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Higher brain functions comprise abilities like language, learning, memory, planning, abstract reasoning and self-awareness; most of these are impaired as age-related cognitive decline progresses to dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The neural foundations of higher functions are supported by the complex organisation of synaptic connections.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	63	 One current paradigm attaches a central role to modulation of synaptic functions, some of which are enduring but the majority of which (especially in brain areas serving higher functions) require constant remodelling to respond optimally to environmental demands.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	64	Brain areas that provide higher functions appear most susceptible to the effects of ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	65	 In one disease model, progression of age-related cognitive decline to dementia is best represented by a reversal of corticogenesis (Arendt, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	66	 To develop such models further requires better understanding of ageing processes than is now available.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Biological components of ageing certainly involve complex interplay between intrinsic (mostly genetic) and extrinsic (mostly environmental) factors.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Recent progress encourages some optimism that a small number of highly conserved genes affect life span and do so through a similarly small number of metabolic processes.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	69	 This view contrasts with the previous  degenerative  position that held biological ageing to be haphazard and not amenable to study.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Generation of metabolites of oxygen termed  reactive oxygen species  (ROS) is an important cause of oxidative stress and ROS are intimately involved in the biology of ageing (Finkel  and  Holbrook, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	71	 There are some parallels between ageing and altered metabolic states induced in lower organisms by adverse circumstances that are surprisingly similar in yeasts, nematodes, fruit flies and mammals (Guarente  and  Kenyon, 2000).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	72	 They permit postponement of reproduction during unfavourable environmental conditions, and control expression of genes that protect against ROS damage and genes involved in insulin signalling (Finch  and  Ruvkun, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Reduced expression of ageing genes involved in insulin-like receptor signalling extends life span, and this may be a specific property of neurons (Boulianne, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	74	Extrinsic contributions to brain ageing are poorly understood and lag some way behind elegant scientific studies of intrinsic components.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Acquired defences against ROS damage are largely derived from dietary antioxidants which oppose ROS production.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	76	 When ROS defences falter, additional burdens are placed on the brain's capacity to maintain structural integrity, most often threatened by increased peroxidation of neuronal lipid membranes, oxidative damage to DNA or large regulatory molecules (Whalley, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Terminally differentiated cells such as neurons cannot dispose of DNA damage by cell division and must rely on their own DNA repair enzymes.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This type of damage may not only compromise the performance of neuronal sub-populations that provide higher mental functions but also impair the capacity to make good or compensate for performance decrements.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	79	Arendt (2001) has summarised much of the available evidence to support the hypothesis that age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease are best understood as progressive failure of synaptic remodelling.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In his view, there is much compelling evidence to accept, first, that abnormal dendritic sprouting occurs in Alzheimer's disease, and second, that  morphoregulatory molecules  involved in neurodevelopment re-emerge as part of Alzheimer molecular pathology.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	81	 He suggests, for example, that the conserved functions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the presenilins and apolipoprotein E (all implicated in Alzheimer's disease) are the key roles of morphoregulatory molecules in synaptic formation, turnover and stabilisation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	82	 They are preferentially expressed in adult brain in areas that retain most capacity to modify synaptic function.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Morphogenesis of neurons has been of enormous relevance in understanding neurodevelopment and differential survival of cell types.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Arendt (2001) now extends their significance to late life.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	85	 First, he argues that these molecular processes underpin the  functional sculpting  used by the immature brain to  self-organise  the acquisition of higher functions such as language.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Second, he identifies among the detritus of dementia, features that imply reactivation of brain self-organising molecular machinery.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	87	 In Arendt's view, it is this reactivation that triggers the cascade of events which results eventually in the selective loss of cortical neurons.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	88	To this model, Arendt (2001) adds the lifelong accumulation of noxious influences on brain function from sources as diverse as malnutrition, neurotoxins and cerebrovascular disease.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Age-related endogenous oxidative damage to neurons (summarised above) further stresses brain adaptive mechanisms.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The gradual and pervasive result is to jeopardise the high investment made by those neurons that retain a capacity for synaptic remodelling after completion of brain maturation.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Missing from Arendt's model are mechanisms that account for individual and gender differences in rate of change in traits associated with dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This dilemma is familiar to developmental neuroscientists and has a strong likeness to current research problems in the molecular genetics of cognition (Plomin  and  Craig, 2001).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Potentially, hormonal and genetic contributions to synaptic remodelling could be relevant.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	94	 For example, there is evidence that oestrogens induce synapse formation in rat hippocampus and that this induction is dependent on apolipoprotein E (Stone et al, 1998).
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Diversity in efficiency of self-organisation may contribute to variation in childhood mental ability; these differences may extend into late life, leading to the divergence between brain ageing and dementia.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	96	Understanding individual differences in age-related cognitive decline is beset with difficulty.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Neuropathological evidence of the hypothetical discontinuity between  normal  ageing and dementia is lacking; the best available evidence suggests that there is no boundary at all.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Detection of sources of variation in rate of cognitive decline requires considerable investment in longitudinal, population-based studies.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The MRC-CFAS findings are the outcome of a longitudinal study that will continue to be informative for many years.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Quite rightly, the study has focused on dementia outcomes over an age interval when the risk of dementia is high.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	101	The problem of the boundary between brain ageing and dementia remains.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It will demand detailed attention in the analysis of current longitudinal databases and in future research design.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Some clarification seems certain if the recommendations of the National Institute of Aging Working Group on Aging and Genetic Epidemiology (2001) come to influence brain ageing research goals and practice.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	104	 As the precise tools of molecular biology are applied to the phenomena of ageing, so boundaries may be brought into focus.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	105	 So far, it seems, those boundaries are not where the clinical data suggested they should be.
0.2581098.12411259.html.plaintext.txt	106	 If the ultimate research goal is to postpone or perhaps even to prevent dementia, research of this type is certain to inform the timing of successful intervention.

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	1	Laboratory of Genetic Diseases Research, National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4472, USA.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	2	For the past 40 years, research into Parkinson's disease (PD) has been predominantly the province of epidemiologists interested in pursuing the connection between the disease and environmental factors such as viral infection or neurotoxins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Hereditary influences were actually discounted because of a high monozygotic twin discordance rate found in studies that were later shown to be inadequate and inconclusive.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	4	 There has recently been a resurgence of interest in investigating hereditary factors in PD when it became more and more apparent that a positive family history was a major risk factor for the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Meanwhile, it also became increasingly apparent from neuropathological studies that the common, idiopathic form of Parkinson's disease had, in fact, a pathological correlate, i.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	6	, the existence of Lewy bodies, an eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion body, distributed diffusely throughout the substnatia nigra, hypothalamus, hippocampus, autonomic ganglia and olfactory tracts.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Although candidate gene approaches to linkage in PD families have not been rewarding, a genome wide scan mapped PD to 4q21-23 in one large family with PD with diffuse Lewy bodies, where a candidate gene, [alpha]-synuclein, resides.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This gene encodes a presynaptic protein of which a peptide fragment is known to be a constituent of Alzheimer's disease plaques.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The identification of a missense mutation in the [alpha]-synuclein gene in four independent PD families suggests that at least some fraction of familial PD with diffuse Lewy bodies is the result of an abnormal protein that interferes with normal protein degradation leading to the development of inclusions and ultimately neuronal cell death.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	10	 There may be common pathogenetic mechanisms involved in [alpha]-synuclein mutations in PD and [beta]-amyloid and presenilin gene mutations in Alzheimer's disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	11	Parkinson's disease (PD) was first described by James Parkinson in 1817 (1 ) and for 180 years the diagnosis has remained a primarily clinical one.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The disease is common with a prevalence of between 500 000-1 000 000 in the United States (2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Life-time risk is 1 in 40, making PD the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	14	 For well over 100 years, neurologists have been aware of a significant role for heredity in the development of PD but a number of factors have, until quite recently, hampered genetic research in PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	15	The first factor was a lack of agreement on precisely what constitutes `typical' PD and whether familial forms of the disease are the `real' PD or not.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This attitude is typified by one medical school professor who, during hospital rounds with a colleague of ours, asserted that a lack of family history was a diagnostic criterion for PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	17	 As a result, research into PD that emphasized familial forms of the disease was seen to be off the mark and not directed at real PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The idea that there was little or no genetic contribution to the etiology of PD was strengthened by a series of twin studies (3 -6 ) during the 1980s that failed to demonstrate increased concordance rates for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	19	A second reason that research efforts may have not emphasized the role of heredity in PD was the striking results of epidemiological studies linking PD to environmental agents such as viruses or neurotoxins.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Much of the research community's energies and efforts became focused on identifying the nature and effects of environmental agents thought to be responsible for causing the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	21	 The 1918 influenza pandemic associated with encephalitis lethargica and, as a late sequela, post-encephalitic PD, pointed to viral infection as a major cause for PD (7 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The significance of this association seemed so strong at one point that one investigator suggested that PD would disappear by 1980 as a clinical entity as the survivors of the pandemic grew old and died (7 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Other strong support for an environmental cause for PD was the occurrence of irreversible symptoms and signs of PD occurring after the injection of illicit drug preparations contaminated with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (8 ,9 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	24	 MPTP metabolites interfere with complex I of the electron transport chain, thus depleting cells of the products of oxidative phosphorylation and exposing the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra to irreversible damage from energy depletion and oxidative stress from free radicals (2 ,10 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	25	Although viral encephalitis or an environmental toxin such as MPTP is clearly capable of damaging the substantia nigra, the 1990s has seen a re-emergence of interest in the genetic causes for idiopathic PD, primarily through the efforts of neurologists such as R.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	26	 As a result, there is currently much more research investigating the role of heredity and gene-environment interactions in causing PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Rather than choosing between the false dichotomy of an exclusive environmental or genetic etiology, geneticists are attempting a synthesis of the epidemiological and genetic data by focusing on three areas of inquiry: (i) inherited and somatic mitochondrial genome abnormalities causing defects in energy metabolism; (ii) candidate gene linkage and association studies of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes; (iii) whole genome scans to locate and identify the genes involved in families with highly penetrant, autosomal dominant PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Two excellent, relatively recent, reviews of the genetic aspects of Parkinson's disease have been published (11 ,12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	29	As in many areas of genetics, definition of the phenotype is one of the most difficult and contentious obstacles facing the geneticist.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	30	 An accurate clinical diagnosis is crucial when trying to categorize patients and families for genetic studies in what is certainly a heterogeneous disorder with multiple etiologies.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	31	 It is generally accepted that the motor symptoms of PD, or parkinsonism, result from a deficiency or dysfunction of dopamine, or of the neurons producing dopamine, in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, regardless of etiology.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, idiopathic PD, the most common form of the disease, has been difficult to approach for genetic study because the name can mean different things to different researchers.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	33	For the clinician, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on finding at least two of the four primary motor signs of the disease: tremor, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity and postural instability.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Also frequently seen, but not considered primary diagnostic criteria, are dementia, defects in gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia and responsiveness to l-DOPA therapy.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The disease is progressive and usually has an insidious onset in mid to late adulthood.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	36	 In one study (13 ) of 100 patients, only three-quarters of patients carrying a diagnosis of PD as determined by qualified neurologists actually had the disease confirmed by autopsy.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this study, if clinical diagnostic criteria were made more stringent retrospectively, specificity rose to 93% but at the expense of a drop in sensitivity to 68%.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	38	For the neuropathologist, autopsy demonstration of diffuse Lewy body disease has come to be the hallmark of PD (14 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In diffuse Lewy body disease, the Lewy body, a characteristic intracellular cytoplasmic inclusion named at the beginning of the 20th century after its discoverer, is found in many regions of the brain, particularly in the neurons of the substantia nigra, in other nuclei in the brain stem, in the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, in the autonomic neurons of the esophagus and gastrointestinal tract and occasionally in the cortex (12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Lewy bodies are very frequently found in the brains of patients dying with PD even though there can be extreme variation in the age of onset, severity and clinical manifestations of the PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	41	 In 100 patients carrying a diagnosis of PD who came to autopsy, the 24 patients who did not have Lewy bodies were found not to have PD and instead to have other causes for their clinical signs (15 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	42	 However, the presence of Lewy bodies per se is not uniquely pathognomic of PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A form of Alzheimer's disease, known as Lewy body variant AD, has been described in which a few Lewy bodies are found in brain cortex along with the pathognomic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of AD (16 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Conversely, it is possible to have the motor dysfunction characteristic of PD, even on a familial basis, without the pathological process whose characteristic marker is the Lewy body (reviewed in 12 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Examples of hereditary parkinsonism syndromes without diffuse Lewy body disease include juvenile autosomal recessive parkinsonism mapping to chromosome 6q25-27 (17 ), the rapidly progressive autosomal dominant parkinsonism associated with dementia, dystonia and disinhibition, located on chromosome 17q21, and X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (18 -20 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	46	 These are well-defined but rare familial disorders that have the motor signs of parkinsonism in common with diffuse Lewy body PD but are certainly different diseases.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In the case of acquired parkinsonism due to MPTP toxicity, the typical Lewy body pathology of PD is not seen after acute MPTP exposure in humans nor in monkeys undergoing chronic MPTP administration although some atypical inclusions have been reported in the brains of these animals (21 -23 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Thus, over the past 10 years, neurologists have come to accept that the highly prevalent disorder, idiopathic PD, is a distinctive disorder usually occurring in middle to late adulthood with characteristic pathology of diffuse Lewy body disease and the classical motor and central nervous system manifestations of parkinsonism (14 ,24 ,25 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	49	 For the purposes of this review, we will concentrate on the genetics of this common form of the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	50	Familial clustering of PD was observed a century ago (11 ,25 ) when 10-15% of PD patients were reported to have a positive family history.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Accurate measurement of the frequency of PD among relatives of affected patients is made very difficult by the inaccuracy of making a diagnosis of PD from history, the relative insensitivity and lack of specificity of the clinical exam, the variability in age of onset, and the rarity of autopsy data required for making the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease in relatives reported to have PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	52	 During the 1980s, a genetic contribution to PD was thought highly unlikely when a series of twin studies failed to demonstrate an increased concordance for PD in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins (3 -6 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	53	 As has been pointed out, however, (26 ) these studies are not interpretable because the number of twins studied and the duration of observation to either support or reject a genetic contribution to PD are inadequate.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	54	 As nearly 80% of the function of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra must be lost before symptoms occur (27 ), reliance on clinical diagnosis alone and a lack of follow-up makes a determination of concordance extremely insensitive.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Further evidence that clinical evaluation to determine concordance in twin studies is far too insensitive comes from the use of positron emission tomography to measure 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia (28 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Concordance rate among monozygotic twins increased when 18fluorodopa uptake into basal ganglia was used to diagnosis preclinical dysfunction of the substantia nigra (29 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	57	 As a result, the lack of increased concordance in twin studies can be essentially discounted as the result of inconclusive and insensitive methodology.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	58	More recently, a number of epidemiological studies (30 -36 ) with differing methodological approaches and study populations have been published and found to support a familial contribution to PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	59	 In case control studies, positive family history was found to be the single greatest risk factor for PD (25 ,30 -36 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	60	 In family studies, a family history positive for PD was found in 10-24% of patients, and the relative risk for PD in first degree relatives of PD patients ranged from 4 to 10.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	61	 In the largest of such studies, the frequency of PD was 2% in 1458 first degree relatives of 233 PD patients, a significantly higher frequency than the 1% seen in the 7834 first degree relatives of 1172 age-matched controls (30 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	62	In an attempt to integrate our current knowledge of the familial nature of PD, the possible role of defects in energy metabolism in causing the disease, and the toxicity of MPTP, research has proceeded on two parallel tracks: looking for mitochondrial genome abnormalities in PD and applying linkage and association methods to affected individuals using polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Modest deficiencies of complex I of the electron transport chain (reviewed in 2 ) have been reported in the substantia nigra (21 ), muscle (37 -39 ) and peripheral blood cells (39 ,40 ) of PD patients but whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary to the disease process is unknown.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The mitochondrial genome in aging brain can demonstrate striking departures from normal (41 ,42 ), but an analysis of the mitochondrial genome in the blood and brain of PD patients has failed to reveal a consistent hereditary or somatic deletion in PD patients as compared with age-matched control blood and brain samples (reviewed in 2 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	65	 A few small studies have suggested a significant association of certain mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms with PD but the sample sizes were small and replication is ongoing (42 ,43 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Thus, there appears to be some consistent abnormalities in oxidative phosphorylation, particularly of complex I, in PD but a direct causative role for inherited or acquired mutation of the mitochondrial genome remains unproved.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	67	In view of the possible involvement of neurotoxins in PD, research has also been directed towards identifying variation in certain drug metabolizing enzymes that might predispose certain individuals to greater toxicity from environmental agents.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Association studies in PD have focused on polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450IA1 (encoded by the CYPIA1 gene) and the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (encoded by the CYP2D6 gene), as well as the monoamine oxidase A and B enzymes (encoded by MAOA and MAOB).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Such association studies are always fraught with difficulties arising from unrecognized ascertainment bias and stratification.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Unfortunately, the nature of a late onset disease means that parental genotypes required to permit the use of the more dependable transmission disequilibrium test for association are usually not available (44 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Nonetheless, a number of studies have suggested significant association between PD and loci encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes and monoamine oxidase.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	72	 In Japan, an MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism in CYPI1A was found to be associated with a 2-fold higher risk for PD in heterozygotes and 6.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	73	5-fold higher in homozygotes (45 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Association studies with the CYP2D6 gene revealed a highly significant 4-fold increased risk among patients with disease onset before age 50 in a Spanish population although no such association was seen in United States and British samples (46 ,47 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A particular haplotype at the MAOA locus was found to be 3-fold more common among PD patients as compared to controls while another haplotype was 3-fold less common among the affected patients (48 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	76	 No such associations were found at the MAOB locus (48 ,49 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Thus, preliminary data support a modest association for certain alleles at these loci with PD but, as has been the history with many association studies, replication of these findings is difficult and requires larger, carefully controlled studies before they can be accepted as definite.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	78	In view of the association of the apolipoprotein E allele 4 with late-onset AD (50 ), it was clearly of interest to investigate whether a similar association exists between PD, either with or without dementia, and the apolipoprotein E4 allele.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	79	 At least two such studies have failed to show any such association (51 ,52 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Of note, one study did find a significant association between apoE4 and the Lewy body variant of AD, but not PD, further supporting the idea that the Lewy body variant of AD and PD are distinct disorders (16 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	81	A genetic contribution to PD has received substantial support from the identification of a number of families in which PD with diffuse Lewy body disease was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (32 ,34 ,53 -58 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Penetrance appeared to be age-dependent, rising from 43% early in adulthood to 85% after age 70.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	83	 In one such family, from the town of Contursi near Salerno in Italy (56 ), linkage analysis has allowed the gene for PD with autopsy-proven diffuse Lewy body disease to be mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4 at 4q21-q23 (59 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	84	 No other positive mapping studies have been published to date, although essentially negative linkage studies have been reported with a variety of candidate genes in some pedigrees with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of Lewy body positive PD (60 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Of note, anticipation was seen in some families with multiple generations affected with PD (57 ,58 ) but was ascribed primarily to ascertainment bias in other families (55 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The repeat expansion detection method failed to show evidence for an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Contursi PD kindred (61 ).

0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Arrows indicate a transition mutation A - >  G resulting in a missense mutation Ala - >  Thr at position 53 of the protein.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	90	In a particularly prescient paper published in 1996, Sommer and Rocca suggested that autosomal dominant PD might be caused by a missense mutation in a cellular protein that changes its physical-chemical properties leading to accumulation of the abnormal protein and neuronal death (62 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Their hypothesis has now received substantial support.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Linkage mapping of PD to 4q21-q23 in the Contursi pedigree suggested a number of candidate genes for PD that mapped to this region.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	93	 One of them, [alpha]-synuclein, was a particularly good candidate.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The protein is a neuron-specific presynaptic membrane protein (63 ) that was originally identified because it encodes a peptide named NACP, for non-A[beta] component of AD amyloid, isolated from plaques in AD (64 ,65 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Sequencing of the [alpha]-synuclein gene in affected individuals from the Contursi kindred (Fig.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	96	 1 ) revealed that affected members of the kindred were heterozygous for a missense mutation, alanine - >  threonine at position 53 of the protein, that segregated with PD in the family (66 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	97	 The same missense mutation was found in three additional unrelated PD families of Greek origin but was absent in 314 chromosomes from control European populations, including nearly 200 chromosomes obtained from random controls from the area near Contursi itself.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	98	 The evidence that this mutation causes PD is based entirely on finding the mutation in four unrelated families and finding it absent in a large set of controls.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Definitive proof requires elucidation of the mechanism by which this mutation causes the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	100	Of note, nearly 30 different proteins have been identified immunologically in Lewy bodies in PD and Lewy body variant AD (67 ) including ubiquitin and the [beta]-amyloid precursor protein implicated in AD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	101	 To date, however, there is no published data indicating whether or not Lewy bodies contain peptides derived from [alpha]-synuclein.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It is interesting to note that NACP, a peptide fragment of [alpha]-synuclein, is an unusual protein in that it adopts an extended, non-globular conformation known as a `natively unfolded' random coil, in vitro.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Such random coil domains promote protein-protein interactions and make the protein amyloidogenic in vitro (68 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The discovery that [alpha]-synuclein, when mutated, predisposes with high probability to the development of PD in families with autosomal dominant disease suggests that a structural abnormality in this protein, either by changing conformation or altering normal proteolytic processing, may be the inciting event for protein aggregation leading to PD.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A similar pathogenic mechanism has been hypothesized for mutant cellular proteins, such as the presenilins and beta amyloid, in causing AD (69 ).
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	106	Over the last few years, a major shift in thinking and focus for PD research has resulted in a rebirth of interest in investigating a genetic contribution to the disease.
0.30746758.9300660.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This change in focus has already begun to bear fruit in the form of a developing consensus on the relationship between diffuse Lewy body disease and PD, leading to much improved genetic epidemiological investigations of the disorder, the identification of families with clear autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, and the identification of at least one gene in which a particular missense mutation predisposes with high probability to the development of the disease.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	5	 To address this possibility, 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing IDE have been genotyped in a sample of 321 impaired glucose tolerant and 403 nondiabetic control subjects.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Analyses based on haplotypic genotypes (diplotypes), constructed with SNPs that differentiate common extant haplotypes extending across IDE, provided compelling evidence of association with fasting insulin levels (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	7	0009), 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	8	0027), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	9	0067), with effects exclusively evident in men.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	10	 The strongest evidence for an effect of a single marker was obtained for rs2251101 (located near the 3' untranslated region of IDE) on 2-h insulin levels (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Diplotype analyses, however, suggest the presence of multiple interacting trait-modifying sequences in the region.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Results indicate that polymorphism in/near IDE contributes to a large proportion of variance in plasma insulin levels and correlated traits, but questions of sex specificity and allelic heterogeneity will need to be taken into consideration as the molecular basis of the observed phenotypic effects unfolds.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	13	The gene encoding insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is located on chromosome 10q23-q24, within a region linked to type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits (1 to 4 ).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	14	 IDE is the major enzyme responsible for insulin proteolysis in vitro (5) and shares structural and functional homology with bacterial protease III, which may function in the termination of the insulin response (6,7).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	15	 In mice, IDE hypofunction induced by IDE gene disruption leads to hyperinsulinemia (8).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, IDE activity in the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat is reduced by 30%, where polymorphism in IDE is likely to be the main contributing factor (9).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Congruence of positional and functional data indicates that sequence variation in IDE may play a role in modifying insulin metabolism in human populations.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Two recent genetic association studies investigated the IDE region in relation to type 2 diabetes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	19	 One produced significant evidence for effects on both type 2 diabetes and plasma glucose levels (10), whereas the other explored only case-control models and obtained no evidence of association (11).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Neither of these studies, however, attempted to directly relate IDE variants to measures of insulin metabolism.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	21	To evaluate the potential influence of genetic variation in IDE on insulin levels and correlated quantitative traits, a haplotype-tagging strategy was used (12) in a Swedish sample consisting of 321 impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 403 nondiabetic control subjects (Table 1).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This study follows a recent report (13) in which we examined 26 polymorphic markers extending across IDE in relation to Alzheimer s disease in a large Swedish population.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	23	 These were used to define regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, which highlighted a LD block spanning 276 kb around IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified as capable of delineating common haplotypes ( > 5%) in Swedes and were subsequently used in tests of association.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	25	View this table:    TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the IGT and nondiabetic control subjects.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	26	  For the present study, 14 SNP markers extending locally across IDE were examined (Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	27	 1), including previously identified tag markers.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We began by genotyping these in the entire male sample to define LD structure and to identify common haplotypes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	29	 All 14 markers were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Pairwise marker correlations suggested strong LD in the region, in agreement with earlier data (13).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Common haplotypes (those  > 5% frequency), inferred with HAPLOTYPER using all 14 markers, were similar to those obtained based on a slightly modified marker set (13).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	32	 LD estimates and inferred haplotypes for the entire sample are shown in Figs.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	33	8) was used to confirm that the studied region does represent an LD block.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	34	 We also confirmed that a selection of three tag markers equivalent to those previously used (13) would be able to delineate common haplotypes and opted not to explore the use of alternative equally valid marker sets.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We note that a variety of different approaches exist for defining optimal SNP sets (15), but we have not explored their use here.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These and other issues may have relevance for attempts at replicating or refuting the present data, as LD structures can differ markedly between divergent populations (K.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	43	  For initial analyses, our intention was to reduce the number of exploratory tests by examining a critical set of phenotypes against a limited number of haplotypic genotypes (also referable to as diplotypes for brevity, we have opted to use the latter term throughout this report).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The principal criterion for diplotype construction is that they can be inferred with high probability and thus reflect with fidelity combinations of common haplotypes for each individual.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	45	 In the presence of limited allelic heterogeneity, this can be advantageous over single marker tests, which can fail to detect effects due to insufficient or complex patterns of LD with pathogenic variants.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	46	 In addition, testing many single markers requires a substantial degree of multiple testing.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Our selection of quantitative phenotypes for analyses included six traits typically examined in relation to diabetes (16 to 18), and these are listed in Table 1.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	48	 We note that studies (19,20) that have investigated IDE in relation to diabetes did not report efforts to relate genotypes to either insulin levels or obesity.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Trait distributions were highly skewed or partially skewed for all six studied phenotypes, and thus only log-transformed data were modeled.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Correlations between traits were extremely high, as was expected (data not shown).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	51	Diplotypes were inferred using the three selected haplotype-tagging markers (Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	52	 3) and tested against all six traits highlighted in Table 1 in men and women separately.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Six of eight possible haplotypes are predicted using these markers, the sequences for which are H1-TCG, H2-TCA, H3-CCA, H4-TTA, H5-TTG, and H6-CCG.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Posterior probability estimates were in excess of 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	55	80 for all phase calls that represent the various combinations of these haplotypes (a threshold that was set for retaining individuals for analyses).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Significant and consistent effects upon traits were evident, with the notable exception of fasting glucose and 2-h glucose levels.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Importantly, effects were evident exclusively in men, which are in agreement with results obtained by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The results of these analyses are shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	59	 4, where data for the male sample are presented.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For all analyses, we combined IGT individuals and nondiabetic control subjects and adjusted for any uniform phenotypic differences between them by including their group identity as a factor in ANOVA models.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Diplotype by group interaction terms in second-order factorial ANOVA models were not significant.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	62	 As the above analyses are based on probabilistically inferred data, we considered it important to also explore models that only entail the use of phase-known data.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	63	 This can be accomplished by excluding individuals that are heterozygous at two or more sites (all individuals with only one heterozygote site are by definition phase known).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	64	 To demonstrate this, an additional analysis was performed in men on the four associated traits shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	65	 4 (insulin, 2-h insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], and BMI).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Results revealed association with all four of these, but significance was highest for BMI (F7,220 = 3.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	75	  In an attempt to refine the possible position of pathogenic variant(s) in the region, single marker tests were conducted on the phenotypes that provided evidence of association in diplotype models.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In considering multiple testing issues, we noted that the strongest individual finding in HOMA-IR (P = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	77	0001) affords 500 individual tests before strict multiple testing correction renders this finding insignificant (given = 0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These tests, using all 14 markers, were performed only in the male sample because diplotype analyses gave us no a priori reason to suspect that latent associations for single markers would be present in the female set.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	79	 These results are shown in Fig.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	80	 5, where consistent effects of rs2251101 and rs2249960 can be seen upon traits.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	81	 The common allele at rs2251101 and the rare allele of rs2249960 were associated with lower trait levels.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Marker rs2251101 and rs1887922 were tested against fasting glucose levels because the latter was specifically reported on by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	83	 (10), and these two markers are in extremely high LD (r2  >  0.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Neither marker showed evidence of association, but we acknowledge that the present study has less power than the aforementioned one.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The result for rs2251101 upon multiple phenotypes nonetheless supports the likely presence of a primary trait-modifying sequence in the 3' region of IDE, as has been speculated (10).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The effect of rs1887922 on 2-h insulin levels was significant, however, albeit considerably attenuated in comparison with rs2251101.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	87	 To further explore the effects of rs2251101, a final model was fitted in which rare-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes were combined and compared with common allele homozygotes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The results of this were as follows: F1,366 = 9.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	89	0008; for fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, HOMA-IR, and BMI, respectively.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Although throughout this study tests were conducted on the combined IGT and normal samples (and a correction applied for possible differences between them), it was considered important to confirm that an effect exists in both populations in at least one analysis.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Using the above model and focusing on the rs2251101 marker and the 2-h insulin trait, significant effects were observed for both the IGT (F1,155 = 13.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	92	011) groups; in both cases the common allele homozygote group had the lowest trait levels.

0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	95	  In summary, we provide strong evidence that sequence variation within or near IDE contributes to variability in measures of insulin metabolism.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	96	 There are several compelling features to these results.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	97	 First, both our study and the study by Karamohamed et al.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	98	 (10) suggest that a primary functional variant occurs in the 3' region of IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In addition, the marker that previously exhibited maximum evidence of association, rs1887922 (10), is in very strong LD with the marker (rs2251101) with the greatest effect in the present study.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	100	 A true pathogenic variant is likely to be in high LD with both of these (and indeed could be one of these markers).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Second, both of these studies suggest effects either exclusively or predominantly in male subjects.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Numerous studies have detected genetic effects exclusively in men (20,21), and sex specificity may be a major confounding factor in genetic analyses (22).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Third, the marker that was in strongest association with quantitative traits related to Alzheimer s disease in our recent study (13) was rs2251101 (from among 26 markers).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Importantly, however, the present analyses suggest that there may be more than one functionally relevant polymorphic site in or near IDE.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This is evident in diplotype models, where no single haplotype appears responsible for either elevating or reducing trait levels and where a number of possible interactions are also apparent.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Evidence of allelic heterogeneity and interaction will in general make fine mapping of the responsible variants a daunting task (23), and this will need to be considered in future studies investigating the IDE region.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	107	We have not directly addressed the question of whether variation in IDE influences the risk for type 2 diabetes.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The two studies that have tested this relationship have produced either no or modest evidence of association, despite examining very large clinical samples.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Our study provides no evidence of association with fasting glucose levels (the primary phenotype used to distinguish diabetic patients).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Rather, the present data likely capture the fundamental influence of IDE upon circulating insulin levels, whereby a genetically determined deficit in enzyme activity may lead to hyperinsulinemia.
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	111	 This could manifest itself as a modulator role in type 2 diabetes, but might be more relevant to other phenotypes, such as coronary heart disease (24) and primary hypertension (25).
0.39201447.15277398.html.plaintext.txt	112	 We believe that continued replication efforts in both normal and morbid populations, as well as functional studies, are now highly merited and will be needed to elucidate the molecular basis and clinical relevance of these observed phenotypic effects.

0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	1	Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Forvie Site, Robinson Way, Cambridge CB2 2SR, UK.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	2	The search for risk factors for Alzheimer's disease is notoriously problematic, both for genetic and acquired risk.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Why is it so difficult to look for risks? The study published by Tyas et al.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	4	 exemplifies many of these difficulties, but also shows why we should persist.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	5	The range of studies which have informed possible risks for dementia varies from studies of very rare families with autosomal dominant patterns of Alzheimer's disease through case-controlled studies and prospective observational cohort studies to randomized control trials of interventions (such as the WISDOM trial of hormone replacement therapy and dementia in the United Kingdom).
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	6	1 The study presented in this edition is a prospective cohort study.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	7	 present data from a longitudinal study of people aged 65 and above, with collection from the non-demented at outset of putative risk factors for dementia.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Increasing age and lower education were associated with increased risk, as expected.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	9	 At 5-year follow-up 36 of those who had developed Alzheimer's disease were compared with 658 individuals who were cognitively intact, out of an original 1763.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Self-report of fumigant/defoliant occupational exposure, migraine and self-reported memory loss were associated with increased risk, and vaccinations and occupational exposure to noise were associated with reduced risk.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Important findings which are different from earlier reports include lack of an influence of family history of dementia, and lack of protective effect for non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and smoking.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	12	The difficulties in interpreting the findings of this study relate to the very nature of the outcome measured, which risk factors are measured and how, as well as whether, these risks could be risks or merely markers of the process (and at what stage in the life course), response rates and the analytical approach to the study design used.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	13	In this study, and many others, Alzheimer's disease is measured rather than dementia.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Alzheimer's disease is identified in life by first fulfilling criteria for dementia, and then examining the characteristics of the dementing process with attention to co-morbidity and other possible causes of dementia.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Whether Alzheimer's is diagnosed will, to some extent, depend on the zeal with which other possible factors are pursued, such as im-aging for vascular and white matter changes and post-mortem confirmation.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Post-mortem studies of selected populations in specialized settings suggest high accuracy of pre-mortem diagnostic processes, but post-mortem series from population-based studies reveal that the neuropathology underlying dementia is, in many cases and most particularly in the older age groups, a mixed picture.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	17	2,3 Searching for pure Alzheimer's disease in this study led to the rejection from analysis of 74 individuals with cognitive impairment who were not considered to have Alzheimer's disease (i.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	18	 a group twice as large as the AD incident group).
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Such search for pure AD is probably better limited to younger age groups, where it is rather easier to identify.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Despite the exclusion criteria the Alzheimer's disease category is likely to represent a mixed group which is likely to dilute associations rather than create them.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Much of the Alzheimer's research endeavour and funding is predicated on the ability to identify a very specific disorder, but justified because of the expected increase in incidence and prevalence in the older age groups.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	22	5 Studies in the older age groups therefore might be better addressing the larger picture of cognitive decline in older age, akin to hypertension which has many possible underlying mechanisms, rather than a specific pathologically defined entity which cannot actually be measured during life as yet.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	23	 At a practical level most studies report on both cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, but the biomedical research community remains rather more comfortable with dichotomous outcomes than continuous ones despite the bulk of evidence that this is a false dichotomy.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	24	Many studies of dementia, most particularly the earlier case control studies, have examined risk cross-sectionally a particular problem for dementia in that for any questionnaire risk collection the data have to be collected from an informant for both cases and controls.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The prospective nature of the Manitoba study sidesteps this issue, as well as the potentially biased reporting of risk.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Five years is a reasonably long period, and the reporting of risk by the subsequently demented is less likely to be affected by pre-diagnostic changes than if shorter follow-up periods are used.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Prospective studies have been important in testing the hypotheses generated by the case-control studies, and in many cases have reached reduced or null findings, such as family history of dementia, head injury and smoking.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Risks can include those indicating early changes, and those which might be genuine risks.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The risks reported here fall into both these categories illustrated by occupational exposure and self-reported memory loss.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Each of these has quite different implications.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	31	 For the former it might be the pursuit of more specific occupational cohort studies, and a search for plausible biological mechanisms, for the latter additional evidence is provided for the question which could be used to identify individuals accurately at an early enough stage in any pathological process to alter subsequent natural history.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It should be emphasized that this provides only a tiny fragment of the necessary evidence.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	33	The method of risk information collection does have problems, in that it is difficult to interpret the exact meaning of specific responses.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In occupational exposure the following questions would be important.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	35	 How accurate and complete are the data, how much and at what life stage and over what period of time did exposure occur? Although it has been shown that self-report of important medical conditions is relatively well-reported, how does this relate to underlying pathophysiological status? These are issues which have been well rehearsed in all epidemiological studies.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	36	 The Manitoba study cannot answer these as practical issues prohibit this, and therefore these findings can only act as signposts for other research.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Self-report of migraine is likely to be more accurate, although under-reporting can occur in headache.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	38	 A major contribution of longitudinal studies to date has been that of the role of vascular disease in risk for dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	39	6 There is increasing evidence that migraine is associated with increased risk for vascular events, and therefore this finding does fit into an emerging picture.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	40	7 This will merit more detailed biological studies, since the vascular consequences of migraine in the brain are likely to be different from those of other identified risks such as carotid artery narrowing.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	41	This study, as do most population-based longitudinal studies in older people, suffers from considerable drop-out and incomplete interviews.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	42	 It is very important to know that the findings are not merely a function of the design, and are robust.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The impact of such design features, and of drop-out can be explored through complex analysis, in which the impact of drop-out and death are assessed,8 or can be assessed through simpler sensitivity analysis.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This study emphasizes the difficulty of even relatively large cohort studies in the small size of the incident group and lack of power, with multiple testing.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	45	 For the significant findings the proportion of controls exposed is very small, and the population attributable risks similarly so.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Combining studies and recognizing in the analysis that each study has measured risk in a different, and inevitably imperfect, way can be a useful way forward (such as the EURODEM studies).
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	47	Which studies are not worth doing? It is generally accepted that further case-control studies examining acquired risk have made their contribution but remain a cornerstone for genetic association studies, if sufficiently powered.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Cohort studies continue to have a contribution to make in terms of hypothesis generation.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	49	 There are many studies of this kind which will provide data over the next few years.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	50	 A limited number are similar in design to the Manitoba study, but several more targeted younger cohorts with more detailed measurement of biological factors are moving into late middle age.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	51	 These cohorts, which are measuring baseline cognition, can incorporate those possible risk factors identified by current cohort studies of older populations (thus carrying hypotheses across generations).
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Specifically targeted studies must then follow to piece together the jigsaw before a coherent picture emerges which might impact on healthy ageing.
0.25199792.11416090.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The reason for urgency is the likely emergence of interventions which may have considerable cost policy and social implications but do not take into account the narrow nature of most research evidence.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	11	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Background Although there is good evidence that interventions for carers of people with Alzheimer's disease can reduce stress, no systematic studies have investigated psychotherapeutic intervention for patients themselves.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This may be important in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease, where insight is often preserved.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	13	Aims The aim was to assess, in a randomised controlled trial, whether psychotherapeutic intervention could benefit cognitive function, affective symptoms and global well-being.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	14	Method Individuals were randomised to receive six sessions of psychodynamic interpersonal therapy or treatment as usual; cognitive function, activities of daily living, a global measure of change, and carer stress and coping were assessed prior to and after the intervention.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	15	Results No improvement was found on the majority of outcome measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	16	 There was a suggestion that therapy had improved the carers' reactions to some of the symptoms.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	17	Conclusions There is no evidence to support the widespread introduction of brief psychotherapeutic approaches for those with Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, the technique was acceptable and helpful individually.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	20	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Alzheimer's disease is devastating in terms of suffering of affected individuals, stress on carers and cost to society.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Medication can effect symptomatic improvement (Burns et al, 1999) and psychological support can reduce strain in carers (Mittelman et al, 1996; Donaldson et al, 1997).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Cognitive-behavioural therapy for carers can reduce carer stress and burden, and behavioural disturbance in affected individuals (Marriott et al, 2000).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	23	 However, no studies have investigated psychotherapeutic intervention directed at those with Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In the early stages of disease, psychotherapeutic interventions may be beneficial as insight is often preserved and psychological adjustment is difficult for those who may assume they face a future of inevitable decline.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Denial, as a defence mechanism, is common for those affected and their relatives (Bahro et al, 1997).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Individual psychodynamic therapy has been described (Bahro et al, 1997) but there is no systematic research (Cheston, 1998).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Some related  emotion-oriented  therapies, including validation and reminiscence, have been promising (Woods, 2002).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A Cochrane review of non-drug therapies found a benefit only for reality orientation (Koger et al, 1999; Neal  and  Briggs, 2000; Spector et al, 2004).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	29	The aim of this study was to assess, in a randomised controlled trial, whether a psychotherapeutic approach directed towards individuals with Alzheimer's disease could benefit cognitive function, affective symptoms and global well-being.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	36	  Procedure Individuals and their carers were recruited from referrals to the memory clinic in South Manchester, UK.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al, 1984); a clinical dementia rating of 1 (Morris, 1993), indicating mild dementia; a score of 15 or above on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al, 1975); living in their own home with a carer in regular contact; and the ability to communicate verbally.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	38	Following consent, individuals were allocated to one of two groups - treatment or control - using computer-generated random numbers organised independently by the Department of Medical Statistics in South Manchester.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Those allocated to the control group could elect to have the therapeutic sessions after the study.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	40	 All assessments and therapeutic interventions were conducted in the individuals' own homes.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Those taking anticholinesterase drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or other psychotropic medication (such as antidepressants) had to be clinically stable on these medications for at least 2 months prior to study entry.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	42	Therapeutic interventions Those in the treatment group received six sessions of psychodynamic interpersonal therapy with an experienced psychotherapist.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Those in the control group received standard care, which consisted of general advice regarding the diagnosis and treatment of dementia, with out-patient review.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	44	Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy Psychodynamic interpersonal therapy was formerly known as the conversational model of psychotherapy (Hobson, 1985) and has been used to treat a wide variety of disorders including depression (Shapiro  and  Firth, 1987; Shapiro et al, 1993), somatisation (Guthrie et al, 1991; Hamilton et al, 2000) and self-harm (Guthrie et al, 2001).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The principal aim of the therapy (in its brief format) is the identification of interpersonal conflicts or difficulties, which are causing or helping to maintain emotional distress.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Client and therapist work together to find and test solutions to these problems, and both intrapsychic and practical changes are encouraged.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	47	Adaptation of the technique The therapy was adapted for people with Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Full details are available elsewhere (Brierley et al, 2003).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The main adaptations included delivery in the individual's home and involving the carer in the treatment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Four specific psychological areas were targeted.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Autobiographical narrative was used to strengthen self-worth.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Important past conflicts, which resonated with current difficulties, were explored and resolved.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The illness itself was discussed and emphasis placed on improving social and interpersonal relationships including, but not emphasising, the role of the partner.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	54	 In addition to the individual therapy, the therapist spent 10 min each session with the carer, listening to the carer's needs and informing the carer of therapeutic progress.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	55	Implementation of the technique Psychotherapy sessions lasted 50 min.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The psychotherapy has been summarised in a manual (Shapiro  and  Firth, 1987) and treatment fidelity was ensured by regular supervision using audiotapes.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	57	 One session from each individual therapy was rated for adherence to the model using the Sheffield Psychotherapy Rating Scale (Shapiro  and  Startup, 1993).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	58	 This scale allows sessions to be rated according to three main subscales: one for psychodynamic interpersonal therapy; one for cognitive-behavioural therapy; and one for generic aspects of psychotherapy.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	59	 The intervention showed high scores on the psychodynamic interpersonal therapy and generic sub-scales and low scores on the cognitive-behavioural therapy scale, confirming adherence to the model.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	60	Assessments of patients The following assessments were carried out before the start of the therapy, at the end of the therapy (6 weeks after recruitment) and at 3 months follow-up.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	61	Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia This is a 19-item scale assessing depressive symptoms in people with dementia (Alexopoulos et al, 1988).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It is rated on a three-point scale of absent, mild or intermittent, and severe.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	63	 A score of 8 or above is indicative of significant depressive symptoms.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	64	Mini-Mental State Examination This is a 30-item measure of cognitive function, with a maximum score of 30 points (Folstein et al, 1975).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	65	 It normally takes 5-10 min to complete.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	66	Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist This is a 24-item questionnaire rating both the frequency of behavioural problems in those with dementia and the intensity of the reactions in their carers (Teri et al, 1992).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Frequency and reaction are both rated on a six-point scale.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	68	Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale This is a 20-item questionnaire, rated by the carer in 10-15 min (Bucks et al, 1996).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Twenty areas of daily activities are each rated on a five-point scale from no problem to severe problems.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	70	Assessments of carers General Health Questionnaire This is a 12-item self-report questionnaire to assess psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity (Goldberg  and  Williams, 1985).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	71	 It is completed in 5 min or less and each item is rated on a four-point scale.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	72	Beck Depression Inventory This is a 21-item self-report questionnaire to assess depression in the respondent (Beck et al, 1961).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	73	 It normally takes 10-20 min to complete.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Each item is scored from 0 to 3 and a total score is derived.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	75	 A total score of 12 or more suggests the presence of depression.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	76	Ways of Coping Checklist This is a 42-item self-report questionnaire to assess the carer's coping strategies (Vitaliano et al, 1985).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	77	 It normally takes 15-20 min to complete and is rated on a four-point scale, from not applicable to very much used.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	78	Global assessment Clinician's Interview-Based Global Impression of Change This is a seven-point scale used by the researcher and an external supervisor to detect change in the patients at 6-week and 3-month follow-up (Guy, 1976).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	79	 The scale goes from very much improved to very much worse.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	80	 The rating was completed following a discussion between the research assistant (F.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	81	), who was masked to group membership (treatment or control).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	82	The 20 individuals who took part in the treatment arm of the study completed a satisfaction survey.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Four statements were presented and the patients were asked to reply.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	84	Statistical analysis, randomisation and calculation of sample size All analyses used the intention-to-treat principle.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The effect of intervention was assessed by comparing changes in mean scores over time on continuous variables using analyses of covariance, with baseline scores and age as covariants.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Some scores required a natural logarithmic transformation prior to analysis to produce a satisfactory approximation to a normal distribution.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	87	 For these scores, geometric means (detransformed log means) are presented rather than simple arithmetic means.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Chi-squared tests, where appropriate, were performed on categorical measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	89	There are no current data upon which to base a power calculation.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In our previous study (Marriott et al, 2000), group sizes of 14 were sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Based on these data, we allowed for a withdrawal rate of 20%, and chose to recruit 20 individuals in each group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Part of the rationale for this pilot study was to obtain some normative data on which to calculate a sample size for a definitive study.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	94	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Study groups Fifty-three consecutive referrals to the memory clinic in South Manchester who satisfied the inclusion criteria were approached to take part in the study; 13 refused, leaving 40 people to be enrolled.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The most common reasons for refusal were: the potential upset the therapeutic sessions could cause and having already taken part in other research projects.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	96	Table 1 describes the study groups and main results from the assessments.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	97	 There were 20 people recruited to each group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Most commonly it was the spouse who cared for the patient; 25% of the treatment group and 15% of the control group were on antidepressants, and approximately two-thirds of each group were on one of the anticholinesterase drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	99	 All participants completed the study and follow-up.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	100	View this table:    Table 1 Participants' characteristics and participant and carer assessments at baseline and 6-week and 3-month follow-up  .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	101	There were no significant differences over the course of the study in the outcome measures for the patients, including ratings on the Cornell Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination and Activities of Daily Living Scale, or in the global rating for the outcome measures for the carers.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	102	 There were no changes over the course of the study in the General Health Questionnaire or Beck Depression Inventory.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	103	 There was a trend towards a slight improvement in the carer's reaction to behavioural problems.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Section 2 of the Ways of Coping Checklist showed a significant decline (P  < 0.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	105	05); this section rates the carer's interaction with other people as an aid to coping.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	106	There was no difference in the ratings when the patients were divided into two groups by Mini-Mental State Examination score (above or below 24).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, there was some evidence that carers of those with less cognitive impairment (score above 24) benefited more from the treatment in that they blamed themselves less for the problems (section 3 of the Ways of Coping Checklist at 3 months, mean value 0.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	108	Qualitative assessments Every participant agreed with the statement  I was able to discuss my difficulties with my counsellor and became more clear about what they are .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Eighty-three per cent agreed with the following three statements:  I find doing things I can do and not thinking too much about what I cannot do, helps me feel less frustrated ;  Although it sometimes felt painful talking about my past, it felt good to get things off my chest, and I felt calm ; and  I have been able to talk about some things that have been difficult to talk to anyone else about .
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	110	Some of the positive comments from patients included:.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	111	 I was able to confide and talk easy in a friendly way.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	113	   It was beneficial but I don't know why.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	114	   My counsellor allowed me to bring out some things which I would not have discussed with relatives or friends.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	116	(a)  It provided me with the opportunity to discuss the problems attached to being a full-time carer for my husband.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	117	  (b)  It also made me feel less guilty about making time for myself and the home.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	119	  (c)  It was a chance to discuss openly my wife's problem.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	120	The 20 participants who received therapy were visited between 6 and 12 months after recruitment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	121	 A semi-structured open-ended interview was carried out.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Five of the patients had some recollection of the sessions, and all five confirmed that they had found it helpful.

0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	126	 However, there was a suggestion that the therapy had improved the carers' ways of coping with some of the symptoms of the disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	127	The therapist was clearly a major source of support for the carers and the patients.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	128	Rationale for the trial We chose to target an area that has received relatively little attention in Alzheimer's disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Traditional therapies have tended to be pharmacological in nature, targeting either cognitive or non-cognitive symptoms (Tariot, 1999).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Non-pharmacological interventions, aside from some behavioural techniques (Allen-Burge et al, 1999), have concentrated on carers, and psychological approaches are of proven benefit in reducing carer strain (Marriott et al, 2000).
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	131	 As far as we are aware, this is the first randomised controlled trial of a psychotherapeutic intervention in people with Alzheimer's disease using standardised outcome measures.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The psychotherapeutic approach was determined following a pilot study and adapted to the individual needs of the participants, as the model dictates.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The joint sessions with the participants and carers merely helped the therapist to focus on those symptoms that were considered important and distressing.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	134	Reasons for non-response The finding that the intervention had no effect on measures that reflect the core features of the illness (cognitive function, activities of daily living) is not surprising.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Only six sessions were provided which, in psychotherapeutic terms, is a low-dose treatment, and this may partly explain the lack of effect.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In addition, a longer study would be needed to assess the more likely benefits in terms of stabilisation of disease.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	137	 The beneficial effect on carers is indicated by the scores on the Ways of Coping Checklist, which showed that the therapy helped carers by providing someone to talk to and, for those caring for people with mild dementia, diminished the carers' sense of self-blame.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	138	 There was minimal involvement of the carers in the therapy.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	139	 A beneficial effect on patients themselves can be inferred from the improvement in the global rating of well-being.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	140	It is not surprising that the involvement of the therapist appeared to have a positive impact and is in accordance with other experience in the field.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	141	 What is important is that the therapy can be adapted for use in people with cognitive impairment.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	142	The trend towards improvements in both carer and patient outcomes attests to the potential benefit of non-pharmacological interventions in this group.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Future studies in this area should concentrate specifically on approaches that combine outcomes of carers and those in their care.
0.21941808.16055825.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The interdependency of the aspirations and outcomes of people with Alzheimer's disease and their carers is emphasised by this project and will influence future studies in this area.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received for publication, February 18, 2005.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The active site glutamate (Glu111) and the active site histidine (His112) of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) were mutated.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	5	 These mutant enzymes exhibit, in addition to a large decrease in catalytic activity, a change in the substrate-velocity response from a sigmoidal one seen with the native enzyme (Hill coefficient  >  2), to a hyperbolic response.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	6	 With 2-aminobenzoyl-GGFLRKHGQ-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine as substrate, ATP and triphosphate increase the reaction rate of the wild type enzyme some 50 to 80-fold.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	7	 This effect is dampened with glutamate mutants to no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity and changed to inhibition with the histidine mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Sedimentation equilibrium shows the IDE mutants exhibit a similar oligomeric distribution as the wild type enzyme, being predominantly monomeric, with triphosphate having little if any effect on the oligomeric state.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Triphosphate did induce aggregation of many of the IDE mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Thus, the oligomeric state of IDE does not correlate with kinetic properties.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The His112 mutants were shown to bind zinc, but with a lower affinity than the wild type enzyme.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The glutamate mutants displayed an altered cleavage profile for the peptide -endorphin.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Wild type IDE cleaved -endorphin at Leu17-Phe18 and Phe18-Lys19, whereas the glutamate mutants cleaved at these sites, but in addition at Lys19-Asn20 and at Met5-Thr6.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus, active site mutations of IDE are suggested to not only reduce catalytic activity but also cause local conformational changes that affect the allosteric properties of the enzyme.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	15	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   It is generally accepted that the accumulation of amyloid -peptides (A),1 particularly amyloid -peptide 1 to 42, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of A in late onset AD is currently unknown but could be a result of either overproduction of the peptide or decreased clearance.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In the case of autosomal dominant AD, it is clear that the early onset of the disease is linked to increased A production and results from mutations in one of several genes: APP, PS1 (presenilin 1), or PS2 (presenilin 2) (1 to 4).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	18	 However, there is only a scattering of evidence that late onset AD is attributable to an overproduction of A (5).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	19	 There are recent reports (6 to 8) that the -secretase involved in amyloid -peptide synthesis is increased in sporadic AD patients.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Whether this increase is a cause of or a consequence of AD and whether this increase in activity will be seen in larger patient populations remains to be established.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	21	Clearance of A is currently receiving considerable attention as a key regulatory mechanism of brain A levels.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	22	 There appear to be two paths for A clearance in the brain.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	23	 One pathway involves the equilibration of A between the central nervous system and plasma mediated through cerebral spinal fluid (9 to 11).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The other pathway involves clearance of A through proteolysis (12 to 15).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	25	 There are a number of peptidases that have been implicated in A clearance.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Those that have received the most attention and are supported by in vivo studies in peptidase-deficient mice include neprilysin (16, 17), insulysin (IDE) (18, 19), and endothelin-converting enzyme (20, 21).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Genetic studies have further suggested a linkage between late onset AD and IDE.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	28	 A linkage of a region of chromosome 10q to late onset Alzheimer disease has been reported by several groups (22 to 25).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This region of the chromosome is within 195 kilobases of the IDE gene.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, to date this analysis has not been refined to the point where the linkage to IDE can be unequivocally established.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	31	56 [EC] ) is an 110-kDa zinc metallopeptidase containing an inverted form of the signature active site sequence (HXXEH) and is thus known as an inverzincin.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The enzyme is primarily cytosolic, although a fraction of the enzyme is peroxisomal due to the presence of a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (26).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	33	 IDE has also been reported as being located on the cell surface and secreted (27 to 29).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	34	 (30) have shown that naturally occurring IDE missense mutations in the rat result in decreased insulin and A degradation.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Primary neuronal cultures derived from these rats secrete increased levels of A peptides; however, the steady-state level of brain A in these animals is unaffected, suggesting compensatory mechanisms.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	36	The specificity of IDE is complex.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The enzyme cleaves a variety of peptides primarily, but not exclusively, at basic or bulky hydrophobic residues (31, 32).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Kurochkin (33) has suggested that IDE cleaves peptides that have a propensity to form -pleated sheet structures.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Cleavage of A by IDE results in the loss of the neurotoxic effects of the peptide and prevents the deposition of A onto a synthetic amyloid deposit (34).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	40	 We have recently shown that IDE exhibits allosteric properties being activated by peptide substrates.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Interestingly, peptides activated IDE toward A peptide cleavage but not toward insulin cleavage (35).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We further established that IDE exists as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and tetramers.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	43	 During the course of our studies on the allosteric properties of IDE, we generated a number of active site mutants as control enzymes.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	44	 We noted that although the activity of these mutants was significantly reduced, the residual catalytic properties were altered.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	45	 We report here the results of these studies.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	46	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Synthesis of the fluorogenic peptide substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQEDDnp was as previously described (36).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Dynorphin A-9, dynorphin A-10, dynorphin A-17, dynorphin B-9, and insulin were obtained from Bachem.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Amyloid peptide 1 to 40 was a product of California Research Peptide Inc.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	49	 -endorphin was obtained from Multiple Peptide Systems through the National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Tools program.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	50	 All other reagents were obtained as the best grade available commercially.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	51	Activity Assays IDE activity was routinely measured with the fluorogenic peptide Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The increase in fluorescence that occurred upon cleavage of the peptide between residues R and K (36) was followed on a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 318 nm and an emission wavelength of 419 nm.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	53	The IDE-dependent hydrolysis of insulin, -endorphin, amyloid -peptide 1 to 40, and dynorphin peptides was followed by reverse phase HPLC using a C4 column and a linear gradient from 0.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	57	Preparation and Purification of IDE Mutants The various His112 and Glu111 rat IDE mutants were prepared in pFast Bac HTb using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	58	 (It should be noted that a methionine located 42 residues downstream of methionine 1 of the IDE cDNA appears to represent the major translational start site (37).

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	83	 As with other zincins, glutamate 111 is believed to be directly involved in catalysis, most probably acting as a general base to facilitate removal of a proton from a water molecule as it attacks the scissile bond.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The effect of mutating the active site glutamate and histidine has been reported to produce an inactive enzyme (37, 42).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Since we noted varying extents of inactivation when mutating similar residues in the related zinc metallopeptidase puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (43), we quantitated the effect of mutating His112 and Glu111 of IDE.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	86	Two mutants of His112, H112Q and H112D, were generated as well as four mutants of Glu111: E111V, E111L, E111A, and E111F.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	87	 We initially compared the kinetics of the various His112 and Glu111 mutants using the fluorogenic substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp.

0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	193	 It should be noted that insulin cross-linking was actually increased with the mutant relative to the wild type enzyme and was attributed to a "relaxation of a rigid conformation stabilized by zinc.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	194	" Evidence for this increased flexibility at the active site came from the demonstration that treatment of the native enzyme with o-phenanthroline increased the extent of cross-linking; however, o-phenanthroline did not increase cross-linking with the H112Q mutant.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	195	Using radioactive zinc, it was concluded that the H112Q mutant did not bind zinc.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Our finding that the residual activity of the two His112 mutants, but not the Glu111 mutants, can be further reduced by treatment with metal chelators indicates that these mutants do contain zinc but that the zinc is bound considerably more weakly than with the native protein.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Thus, our results with both the His112 and Glu111 mutants support and extend the general conclusions of Perlman and Rosner (37) that mutation of the active site histidine causes a change in the conformation about the active site of IDE.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	198	 The results presented here suggest that this is not due to the loss of zinc binding but probably due to local conformational changes that occur within the active site.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	199	A rather surprising finding is that mutation of either the catalytic glutamate or the zinc coordinating histidine converts the substrate-velocity curves from sigmoidal to hyperbolic.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Thus, the homotropic allosteric activation previously reported by us (35) is absent in the mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Since it has been established that IDE can exist in an oligomeric state (32, 35, 50, 51), one possible explanation is that the active site of IDE is at the interface of two subunits and that mutation of the active site residues produces a local conformational change that affects subunit interaction.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	202	 This does not appear to be the case, since both we (35) and Perlman et al.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	203	 (42) have shown that formation of oligomers containing active and inactive subunits does not abrogate activity.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	204	 However, such a mixed oligomer does eliminate allosteric activation (35).
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Thus, the data is probably explained by the proposal that the active site mutations produce a local conformational change that is transmitted to the adjacent subunit.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Although the end result is the same, it appears that there are differences in the local conformational changes produced by mutating the catalytic glutamate and mutating the zinc-coordinating histidine.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	207	 This is most evident from the observation that the cleavage profile for -endorphin is altered in the glutamate mutants but not the histidine mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	208	In addition to the active site mutations affecting the kinetics of substrate binding, these mutations also desensitized the enzyme to activation by triphosphates in the form of ATP or triphosphate itself.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The large increase in activity seen with the native enzyme was significantly reduced to either no effect or less than a 3-fold increase in activity with the glutamate mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	210	 Even more amazing was the effect seen with the active site histidine mutants, particularly H112Q.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	211	 In this case, triphosphate changed from an activator to a rather potent inhibitor.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	212	 This clearly indicates that the active site of these mutants is conformationally different from the wild type enzyme and is further modulated by additional conformational changes produced by the binding of the triphosphate moiety.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	213	The sedimentation equilibrium data show that, with the exception of the H112D mutant, both the native enzyme and the mutants are predominantly monomeric.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	214	 Triphosphate does not affect the qualitative oligomerization mechanism of the soluble enzyme, but it increased the tendency to form insoluble aggregates in the case of the E111A and E111F mutants.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Such aggregation may reflect a conformational change due to triphosphate binding.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Thus, there is no obvious correlation between oligomeric state and activity, and the finding of a monomeric native enzyme is not consistent with its allosteric properties.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	217	 On the other hand, gel filtration shows the native enzyme existing as dimers and tetramers, and at higher protein concentrations dynamic light scattering shows exclusively tetramers.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Thus, it is clear that IDE can exist in a number of different oligomerization states.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	219	 We would suggest that the allosteric kinetics observed can result from substrate induced oligomerization.
0.5654884.15749695.html.plaintext.txt	220	 In the case of mutant IDE, perhaps an altered local conformational change at the active site is transmitted through the protein such that it prevents the formation of oligomers.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	11	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS REFERENCES   The gene for insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) represents a strong positional and biological candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	12	3, a region linked to diabetes in several populations; the rat homolog has been directly implicated in diabetes susceptibility; and known functions of IDE support an important role in glucose homeostasis.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	13	 We sought evidence for association between IDE variation and diabetes by mutation screening, defining local haplotype structure, and genotyping variants delineating common haplotypic diversity.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	14	 An initial case-control analysis (628 diabetic probands from multiplex sibships and 604 control subjects) found no haplotypic associations, although one variant (IDE2, -179TC) showed modest association with diabetes (odds ratio [OR]1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Linkage partitioning analyses failed to support this association, but provided borderline evidence for a different variant (IDE10, IVS20 to 405AG) (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Neither variant was associated with diabetes when replication was sought in 377 early onset diabetic subjects and 825 control subjects, though combined analysis of all typed cohorts indicated a nominally significant effect at IDE2 (OR 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In the absence of convincing support for this association from linkage partitioning or analyses of continuous measures of glycemia, we conclude that analysis of over 2,400 samples provides no compelling evidence that variation in IDE contributes to diabetes susceptibility in humans.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	18	Linkage disequilibrium analysis within candidate genes represents the final common pathway for the identification of diabetes-susceptibility genes.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Candidate selection is typically based on positional information from linkage studies in humans and rodent models and/or a perceived match between the gene s function and the pathophysiology of the condition.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	20	Several independent lines of evidence suggest a role for the gene encoding the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE: LOCUSLINK reference 3416; EC reference 3.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	21	56) in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, making this a promising candidate for analysis.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	22	 First, IDE maps to a region, on chromosome 10q, showing evidence for linkage to type 2 diabetes in several populations.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	23	 type 2 diabetic pedigrees, evidence for linkage (multipoint logarithm of odds [LOD] = 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	24	99) peaked near to D10S1765, only 4 Mb from IDE, and conditional analyses have suggested epistatic interaction with the well-replicated susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q (1).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Linkage to 10q has also been reported in Finns (2), North American Europeans (3), Mexican Americans (4), and French (5), though the latter two map 40 to 50 cM telomeric and may reflect a distinct locus.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	26	Second, the rat homolog of IDE is directly implicated in type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In the GK rat model (6,7), a locus for poststimulation glycemia was mapped to a region of rat chromosome 1 syntenic with human 10q23-26 (8,9) and subsequently localized to a 1-cM region around Ide (10).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Two amino-acid substitutions in Ide were found in susceptible congenic strains, which, together, conferred postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced insulin degradation in isolated muscle cells, and other diabetes-related phenotypes (10).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	29	Third, the known and presumed functions of IDE are consistent with a role in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Strong species conservation attests to important biological functions, and diverse cellular and metabolic roles have been proposed (11,12).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Although some of these remain controversial (13), IDE seems to play a major role in the breakdown of insulin in insulin-responsive tissues (14), thereby influencing the extent of the cellular response to insulin (11).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This association between IDE activity and insulin clearance and resistance is supported by in vitro and clinical studies (14 to 16).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Furthermore, the substrate specificity of IDE coincides with peptides capable of amyloid formation (including both amylin and insulin), indicating that IDE may prevent accumulation of amyloidogenic peptides (12).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Disruption of this scavenging function might thereby promote aggregation of the islet amyloid characteristic of type 2 diabetes and contribute to deficient ss-cell capacity.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	36	This congruence of positional and biological candicacy led us to evaluate the role of IDE variation in diabetes susceptibility in humans.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	54	 These samples were retyped with 100% concordance, and haplotype patterns provided no indication of mistyping (no novel haplotypes were generated).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	55	 These modest departures from equilibrium are likely, therefore, to reflect stochastic variation and are not exceptional given the number of tests performed.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Males and females did not differ in SNP or haplotype frequencies, and no additional associations were uncovered by sex-stratified analyses.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	63	  To determine whether associations might be more evident in families with apparent 10q linkage, we subdivided the W2P sample according to the family nonparametric linkage (NPL) score at the 10q locus.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Such linkage partitioning methods have been applied in several recent type 2 diabetes studies (18 to 21).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Here, we used linkage partitioning in a purely exploratory capacity, given uncertainties over the statistical properties of these methods when the evidence for linkage is not confirmed, as well as the possible consequences of partitioning bias when stratifying on proband genotype alone.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	66	 No difference was evident between "linked" and "unlinked" probands in IDE haplotype frequencies (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The association previously seen at IDE2, between W2P and CON1, was attenuated when only linked probands were considered (genotypes P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	68	 There was no difference in IDE10 genotype frequencies between 10q-linked probands and CON1 control subjects (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, the complementary analysis, testing whether IDE genotype partitioned the evidence for 10q linkage, was more encouraging.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	70	 In families in which the proband carried the weakly associated IDE2 genotypes, CT and CC, the LOD score at D10S1765 increased from 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The same analysis based on IDE10 genotype (grouping GA and GG), yielded a LOD of 2.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	72	Clarification of the role of IDE2 and IDE10 variants was sought by further genotyping in early-onset type 2 diabetic cases (YT2D, Warren 2 trios [W2T]) and a large control resource (CON2).
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Both young-onset case groups had similar clinical characteristics (Table 3), and genotypes were combined after appropriate tests of homogeneity.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	74	 These replication cohorts have an average age-at-diagnosis some 15 years earlier than the sibpair probands; however, both rigorous exclusion of non-type 2 diabetes and the high parental prevalence of typical late-onset type 2 diabetes in both cohorts (22,23) argue against appreciable qualitative differences in the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes susceptibility between the initial and replication cohorts.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Typing IDE2 and IDE10 effectively reduces IDE haplotypic diversity to three common haplotypes (Fig.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	77	 All data were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	78	 In these replication cohorts, we found no significant association of either SNP (IDE2: genotypes P = 0.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	80	41), regardless of whether the data were stratified for sex.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	81	 In the full Exeter Family Study (EFS) cohort (n = 841), there was no association between either SNP and fasting plasma glucose on combined or sex-stratified analyses.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	83	  Having selected IDE on the basis of its positional and biological candidacy as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene, and undertaken a detailed survey of variation within the gene, we have been unable to compile any clear evidence for association between IDE variation and type 2 diabetes.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	84	 This, despite the fact that our analyses utilized several large and well-characterized populations, and selection of the diabetic individuals for early onset and positive family history was designed to enhance detection of type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The only SNP showing association in the initial case-control analysis (IDE2) was not associated in our replication set.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, it is worth noting that the combined OR for IDE2 across both initial and replication sets does achieve nominal significance (combined OR for allele C, 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	87	 This result demands cautious interpretation, given allowance for the low (though unquantifiable) prior odds that even strong biological candidates, such as IDE, will harbor substantial susceptibility effects and for the lack of support from any of the other analyses performed.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The only other variant emerging from the initial analyses, IDE10, showed some ability to partition the evidence for linkage, but showed no evidence of association with type 2 diabetes (combined OR for allele A, 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	89	Our survey of IDE variation covered all exons, adjacent intronic sequence, and the promoter.

0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	91	 subjects (17), has strong credentials for an impact on IDE structure and/or function.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Clearly, our findings do not support the hypothesis that variation within IDE is exclusively responsible for the linkage signal detected on chromosome 10q.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, as with any association study, we cannot exclude the possibility that the variants typed (especially IDE2) have a lesser susceptibility role.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	94	 The present study has, we estimate,  > 95% power to detect an association between IDE2 and type 2 diabetes under a multiplicative model with a genotypic relative risk of 1.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This falls to 60% under a more stringent significance threshold (P = 0.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	96	001) designed to reflect modest prior odds that the candidate selected plays a biologically significant susceptibility role.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Furthermore, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that IDE variants other than those studied have a more marked contribution to type 2 diabetes susceptibility.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	98	 If so, such variants must lie outside the regions surveyed and display limited linkage disequilibrium with any of the typed variants.
0.3856874.12716770.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Current understanding of linkage disequilibrium patterns within human populations indicates that analyses, such as ours, which seek associations using SNPs capturing haplotypic diversity within the gene of interest, will have good power to detect associations with other, as yet unidentified, common variants within the same gene (24).

0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   Loci underlying autosomal dominant forms of most neurodegenerative disease have been identified: prion mutations cause Gerstmann Straussler syndrome and hereditary Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, tau mutations cause autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia, and -synuclein mutations cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	4	 In all these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and in these cases the whole protein is deposited.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in APP or presenilin 1 or 2 cause autosomal dominant disease and these are the substrate and proteases, respectively, which are responsible for the production of the deposited peptide, Ass.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Thus, in all cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	7	 We briefly review this remarkably predictable biology, but also point out that it seems sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed to by genetic variability at the same loci, strongly suggesting that the quantity of the normal protein produced influences risk for the sporadic forms of the disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The evidence for this assertion is strongest in Parkinson's disease (PD), where genetic variability in -synuclein expression affects risk of developing disease, although the oldest evidence for the notion that increased expression of normal sequence protein can lead to disease comes from the observation of Alzheimer's disease in trisomy 21 cases.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	9	 From these observations, we make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases in general.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	10	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   In the last 15 years there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the etiology of the autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The loci underlying the autosomal dominant forms of Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease (1), frontal temporal dementia (2) and Parkinson's disease have been identified (3).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In each case, the underlying locus has encoded the protein that is often deposited in the disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In Creuzfeldt to Jakob disease, this is the prion protein: in frontal temporal dementia, it is tau, and in Parkinson's disease it is -synuclein.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In Alzheimer's disease, the situation is a little more complex in that the deposited peptide, Ass, is derived from a fragment of the APP protein when metabolized by the -secretase complex: a key component of this complex are the presenilins and mutations in either APP or presenilin 1 or 2 can lead to disease (4 to 6).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	15	These findings are well established and have driven therapeutics research, especially because they have allowed the development of animal models of these diseases as well as defined therapeutic targets (7).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	16	 In each of these examples, the precise  pathologic species  of protein is obscure, if there is one, and it is debated whether the deposits themselves, or some intermediate species such as an oligomer, are responsible.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This has been extensively investigated, with the balance of recent data favoring smaller intermediate species as the toxic entities (8); however, the generality of the fact that the mutated protein in each example can be deposited suggests that the process of pathogenicity is related to, although perhaps separable from, the process of deposition.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	18	By studying the autosomal dominant forms of these and other diseases, researchers hope to gain insight into the more common, sporadic forms, and from a mechanistic perspective, this has certainly been the case.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, perhaps more surprisingly, over this last 4 years, it has become clear that, in the case of many of these diseases at least, the haplotype of the Mendelian pathogenic locus influences the disease risk for sporadic disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	20	In this review, we briefly summarise these data, and then make predictions concerning the etiology and pathogenesis of these and other neurodegenerative diseases.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	21	 First, though, it is worth noting what a  haplotypic association  means from a mechanistic perspective: in the absence of coding changes, a haplotypic association implies there is genetic variability either in the amount of expression of the protein, or in the alternate splicing of the protein, and that this contributes to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	22	   THE DISEASES TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   Prion diseases The prion gene has two common coding variants in Caucasian populations: one with prion M129 the other with prion V129 (9,10).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	23	 It has long been recognized that homozygosity at codon 129 predisposes to sporadic disease, presumably because of the necessity of prion to prion interactions and symmetry considerations (9,10).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	24	 However, in addition to this well-established risk, recent genetic data have shown that the prion haplotype confers additional risk to idiopathic disease (11), clearly suggesting that genetic variability in prion expression contributes to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	25	 While these genetic data do not establish whether high expressors or low expressors are more susceptible, and since prion knockout mice are completely resistant to disease (12), it is most parsimonious to expect that those who express high levels of prion protein, and are homozygotes at codon 129, are most susceptible to disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	26	Alzheimer's disease Extensive sequencing of the APP gene in late-onset Alzheimer's disease has failed to identify mutations (13).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, analysis of data from sibpairs affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease has consistently suggested that APP is a locus for this form of disease (14,15).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This suggests that genetic variability at the APP locus contributes to disease risk, although the precise variability has not been identified.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Such a finding is consistent with the longstanding observation that individuals with trisomy 21 inevitably develop Alzheimer pathology by their fifth decade (16); however, those few cases of Down syndrome caused by triplication of chromosome 21 distal to the APP gene do not develop Alzheimer's disease (17).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, having three copies of the APP gene leads to Alzheimer pathology in the fifth decade and as yet unidentified genetic variability at the APP locus appears to contribute to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	31	Frontal temporal dementia: tangle diseases Mutations in the tau gene cause many cases of autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia in which there is tau pathology.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	32	 There are many sporadic diseases in which tau pathology occurs, usually as tangles, but also as Pick bodies or Argyrophilic grains (18).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	33	 There are two genetic haplotype clades in Caucasian populations, designated H1 and H2, which differ in intron sizes, promoter sequence and wobble bases (19).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The H1 haplotype has a frequency of 75% in Caucasians, and thus the H1 homozygotes constitute 60% of such populations.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, individuals with one of the three sporadic tau diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy (19), corticobasal degeneration (20) and argyrophilic grain disease (21), although not Pick's disease (22) or Guam disease (23), show a robust association with H1 homozygosity, with a frequency of H1 homozygotes being 95%.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	36	 These data show clearly that variability in either tau expression or tau splicing variability (or both) contribute to disease risk.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In this case, it is difficult to determine whether it is control of splicing or control of expression which is the key variable because it is indeed clear that many mutations which lead to Mendelian disease do so through altering alternate splicing (2,24).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	38	Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia Mutations in the -synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease, and -synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathognomic feature of Parkinson's disease (25).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Genetic variability in the -synuclein promoter contributes to the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease (26,27) with the  associated  promoter allele being a stronger promoter (28).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Perhaps most convincingly, triplication of the whole -synuclein locus causes autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease/Lewy body dementia with an onset age in the fourth decade (29) and duplication of the locus leads to disease in the fifth decade (30).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, with Parkinson's disease, there is a clear dose relationship between synuclein expression and disease occurrence, with normal genetic variability in the promoter contributing to the risk of typical idiopathic disease and with multiplications of the locus causing Mendelian disease with an onset age determined by the precise  dose .
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Protein studies in cell lines from affected individuals in these kindreds reveal that the amount of -synuclein produced correlates with disease (A.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	43	   METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   The problems of the assessment of haplotypic expression Rigorous assessment of the impact of haplotypic variation on quantitative gene expression and splicing is a surprisingly difficult problem (32).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	44	 The usual method to test variability in the control of expression is to tie an artificial and arbitrary reporter construct to a bacterially-derived reporter gene and measure its transient effect on expression in a tumor-derived cell line.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Clearly such experiments are unlikely to yield data of direct relevance to subtle effects of variation on gene expression.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	46	 The development of allele-specific gene expression methods (33,34) offers hope that more subtle effects can be studied although these methods are arduous and require access to large numbers of well-maintained human brain specimens (33).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	47	   CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION THE DISEASES METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS CONCLUSIONS AND PREDICTIONS REFERENCES   In all the diseases referred to above, there is thus strong evidence that, while frank mutations in the pathologic locus cause autosomal dominant disease and protein deposition, genetic variability in expression of the normal protein contributes to the risk of idiopathic disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	48	 In Alzheimer's disease, where the deposited protein is a peptide fragment of the primary locus, mutations in the cleaving enzyme also lead to disease.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	49	 These simple observations lead to some predictions: the mutant and wild-type proteins are quantitatively different, not qualitatively different in their properties in all cases; in other diseases where protein deposition is part of the process, such as the polyglutamine diseases and ALS, genetic variability in the promoter of the gene should be considered as a factor influencing, where applicable, risk of sporadic disease or age of onset of familial disease (see 35 for suggestions that this might also be the case in Huntington's disease); in polyglutamine diseases in which the deposited fragment is cleaved from a precursor molecule, genetic variability in the cleaving proteases or other interactors which influence stability should be assessed as a risk factor loci; other loci which impact on risk for these diseases in general, may merely cause their effect through altering the levels of the primary proteins, either because they are transcription factors, or because they are responsible for protein breakdown.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	50	While these findings were unexpected, perhaps they should not have been.
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	51	 All chemists know the power of the law of mass action, and perhaps it should not have surprised us that it may have profound implications in determining our risks of neurodegenerative disease (36).
0.40480462.14976159.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Of course, one therapeutic approach in all cases, therefore, would be to aim to reduce the concentrations of the toxic proteins in the relevant tissue compartment either through decreased production, increased breakdown, or both.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	1	From the Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	2	Received for publication, August 2, 2005 , and in revised form, September 8, 2005.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Human genetic data have associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) with Alzheimer disease (AD), and purified ACE has been reported to cleave synthetic amyloid -protein (A) in vitro.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Whether deficiency in ACE activity, arising from genetic alteration or pharmacological inhibition, can decrease A degradation and allow A accumulation in intact cells is unknown.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We cloned ACE from human neuroblastoma cells and showed that it had posttranslational processing and enzymatic activity typical of the endogenous protease.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Cellular expression of ACE promoted degradation of naturally secreted A40 and A42, leading to significant clearance of both species.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that both active sites within ACE contribute to A clearance, and an ACE construct bearing mutations in each catalytic domain had no effect on A levels.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Pharmacological inhibition of ACE with a widely prescribed drug, captopril, promoted the accumulation of cell-derived A in the media of -amyloid precursor-protein expressing cells.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Together, these results show that ACE can lower the levels of secreted A in living cells and that this effect is blocked by inhibiting the protease's activity with an ACE inhibitor.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This work, combined with the genetic studies, supports the hypothesis that ACE may modulate the susceptibility to and progression of AD via degradation of A.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Our data encourage further analyses of the ACE gene for disease association and raise the question of whether currently prescribed ACE inhibitors could elevate cerebral A levels in humans.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	12	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   An early and pathogenically important feature of Alzheimer disease (AD)2 is the progressive accumulation and deposition of the amyloid -protein (A) in brain regions serving memory and cognition.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Biochemical, cell biological, animal modeling, genetic, and emerging clinical data all suggest that A is an upstream initiator of the disease process and its associated neuropathology (1-4).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Although no proven disease-modifying treatments are currently available, recent efforts to treat AD have focused on both decreasing the production of A and enhancing its clearance from the brain.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	15	 One little studied approach to A clearance is augmenting the degradation of the peptide by various proteases expressed in the brain.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Thus far, the metalloproteases neprilysin (NEP) (5), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (6), and the endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (7) have each been implicated as A-degrading proteases in the mammalian brain.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	17	 The serine protease plasmin has been implicated in A degradation in vitro (8), although genetic plasmin deficiency did not promote accumulation of murine A in vivo (9).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Supporting a role for therapeutic regulation of A-degrading proteases, the overexpression of IDE or NEP in a murine model of AD decreased cerebral A levels and produced significant attenuation of A-associated neuropathology (10).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	19	Somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloprotease containing two homologous regions, termed the N- and C-domains, each of which is proteolytically active (11).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	20	 ACE has a single transmembrane domain and is cleaved from the cell surface at a low rate, resulting in the secretion of its ectodomain into the media of cultured cells and plasma (12, 13).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	21	 ACE has been intensively characterized for its role in the regulation of blood pressure by cleaving angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin (14).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This function of ACE is modulated pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors, which bind competitively to the active site zinc to prevent substrate hydrolysis.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This commonly prescribed class of drugs is used for the treatment of hypertension and other disorders.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In addition to regulating vasoactive peptides, ACE shows a broad substrate specificity, including several neuropeptides, and it is able to metabolize substrates using both exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities (15).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Interestingly, despite their homology, the N- and C-domains display differential capacity to degrade some substrates and can be inhibited selectively by certain ACE inhibitors (16, 17).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently, ACE was found to participate in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal transduction pathway, apparently independently of its proteolytic function (18).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	27	A potential relationship between ACE and AD was first suggested by human genetic studies, which reported that an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism within intron 16 of the ACE gene associates with AD (19).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Specifically, the I allele was associated with an increased risk for AD, whereas the D allele was associated with protection (20, 21).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Of potential mechanistic relevance, inheritance of the D allele has been associated with increased plasma ACE levels (22).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Regarding disease specificity, the I allele has been found to associate positively with AD but not with vascular dementia or vascular pathology (23, 24).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The I/I genotype has also been linked to smaller volumes of the hippocampus and the amygdala (24).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Importantly, post-mortem analyses of AD patients determined that those with the I/I genotype had a trend toward increased brain A42 load compared with the D/D genotype (25).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE gene have also been shown to associate with AD, and there is a decrease in the prevalence of the AD-susceptible genotype with increased age, consistent with a modulation of longevity (26).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	34	Post-mortem studies of patients with AD have found elevated levels of ACE in the temporal cortex and specifically within pyramidal cortical neurons (27, 28) as well as significantly increased ACE activity in the medial hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, frontal cortex, and caudate nucleus (29).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A mechanistic link between ACE and AD was suggested when affinity-purified ACE was shown to degrade synthetic A-(1-40) between the Asp7-Ser8 bond in vitro, producing a truncated 33-residue peptide that exhibited decreased aggregation and cytotoxic potential (30).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	36	A plausible interpretation of the above genetic, neuropathological, and biochemical findings is that ACE is implicated in AD via direct proteolysis of the A peptide, modulating A levels within the brain.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This hypothesis suggests that reduced ACE activity, either by genetic mechanisms or chronic pharmacological inhibition, could increase cerebral levels of A40 and/or A42 and thus presumably increase the risk of developing AD and/or contribute to its progression.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	38	 To address this hypothesis in intact, living cells, we cloned and characterized human neural ACE and determined its role in the clearance of secreted A.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	39	We demonstrate that ACE promotes the clearance of naturally produced A40 and A42 and leads to secondary degradation of both A species.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Further, by using site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the full-length enzyme, we show that both the N- and C-domains of ACE are capable of promoting A degradation with similar capacity.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of A-secreting cells with a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor prevents ACE-mediated A clearance and results in accumulation of the A peptide.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Our data do not support a role for the putative signal transduction mechanism of ACE (18) in its lowering of A, since overexpressing the proteolytically inactive form of ACE produced no change in A levels compared with vector alone.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Finally, we show that captopril, a widely prescribed ACE inhibitor, promotes A accumulation in the media of cells expressing human APP and ACE.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	206	It has been reported recently that the N-domain of ACE, but not its C-domain, is responsible for the degradation of synthetic A40 in vitro (40).

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In our studies, we used conservative mutations to inactivate each catalytic domain in the same molecule, conserving the overall structure and sequence of the full-length protein.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	210	 It is possible that the C-domain is only able to degrade A in intact cells, not in vitro.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	211	 There is evidence that each catalytic domain of ACE regulates the activity of the other (41), suggesting that the full-length protein is required for normal substrate recognition and degradation.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The C-domain, when expressed outside of the context of the full-length enzyme, may not retain the tertiary structure required to degrade larger substrates such as A, whereas much smaller substrates are still processed (40).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	213	 It is unlikely that incomplete inactivation of the N-domain in our E362D mutant enzyme could account for the observed decrease in A, because when both domains are inactivated in the E362D/E960D ACE construct, we observe no change in A levels compared with the empty vector control.

0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	235	  Growing genetic evidence suggests ACE as a potential risk factor for AD.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	236	 At this writing, approximately 40 published studies have examined this relationship, with the majority finding a significant association of ACE genotype to AD.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	237	 Further, post-mortem analysis of AD brain tissue has shown significant elevation of ACE protein compared with control (28), perhaps representing an up-regulation of an A clearance mechanism.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Interestingly, initiation of ACE-mediated signal transduction by its substrates has been shown to up-regulate the enzyme's own expression via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (18, 42).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	239	 This feedback system provides a hypothetical mechanism by which ACE could modulate its own expression depending on levels of the A substrate, leading to elevated levels of ACE in AD cortex.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	240	Our observation that ACE inhibition in cells expressing both human APP and ACE promotes accumulation of secreted A may bear clinical relevance.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Given that neurons produce both APP and ACE and neuronal ACE is up-regulated in AD (27), we hypothesize that chronic pharmacological inhibition of ACE could increase levels of brain A by reducing ACE-dependent proteolysis.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	242	 No studies have yet examined the consequence of chronic ACE inhibition on levels of brain or plasma A in humans.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	243	 Very few clinical trials of ACE inhibitors have analyzed their effects on cognitive decline in AD subjects, and results to date are inconclusive (43-45).
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	244	No studies on the effects of ACE deficiency or overexpression on A metabolism in vivo have been reported.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	245	 Such studies may be problematic in interpretation, because endogenous murine A has amino acid differences from the human peptide immediately surrounding the putative site of cleavage by ACE, and these could affect its properties as a substrate.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	246	 Future in vivo studies that examine ACE inhibition, deficiency, or overexpression in mice expressing human APP may be most instructive regarding the role of ACE in Alzheimer disease.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	247	In the context of our new findings and the earlier studies reviewed above, we hypothesize that decreased activity of ACE in the aged human brain, originating either from genetic polymorphisms or pharmacological inhibition, may promote A accumulation and thus modulate the likelihood of the development of Alzheimer disease and/or its neuropathological severity.
0.24991155.16154999.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Our findings suggest the need for further analyses of the biological effects of ACE genetic deficiency and ACE pharmacological inhibition, both in experimental models of AD and in the large human population currently experiencing chronic ACE inhibition.

0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	4	Alzheimer s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with aging.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	5	 It can also be classified as a complex polygenetic disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or schizophrenia, because there are both genetic and environmental factors that result in the phenotypic expression of what is clinically called AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Due to the demographic shifts and remarkable medical advances of the last century, aging populations are now the fastest growing portions of the population, and women constitute a majority of this population due to their increased life expectancy relative to males.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Thus, women would appear to be at special risk for AD, although this review will also focus on gender differences in disease expression and opportunities for treatment using estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	8	Alzheimer s disease was first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1906, based on a single case of a 51-yr-old woman who developed severe behavioral disturbances, aphasia, and memory loss.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Alzheimer followed the patient for several years and described the classic neuropathological findings of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic amyloid plaques in her brain postmortem.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Emil Kraeplin proposed the disease eponym several years after his initial description.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Remarkably, Alzheimer s original notes, and the original neuropathological specimens have been recovered within the past 2 yr, confirming that the patient did indeed have AD by modern diagnostic criteria (1, 2).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	12	Although AD was long believed to be a rare disease, awareness of AD prevalence was highlighted in the late 1960s and 1970s by Blessed and colleagues (3) and Katzman (4).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Present epidemiological data suggest that dementia, defined as the clinical state of acquired cognitive loss in multiple domains, affects about 5 to 7% of individuals over age 65 yr.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In the East Boston study of community-dwelling elderly, by age 85 yr up to 47% of individuals will suffer dementia (5).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The vast majority of these cases will have AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Translated into population statistics, these numbers imply a current U.

0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This has been estimated to cost between 70 to 100 billion dollars/yr, much of it due to the need for long term care facilities.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	19	With women over 65 yr of age outnumbering men (20 million women vs.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	20	), and with an American women who reaches age 65 yr having an average life expectancy of 19 yr (15.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	21	5 yr for men), women appear to be at particular risk for AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Meta-analysis of population prevalence studies found no sex difference in overall dementia prevalence by gender, but showed that AD rates tend to be higher in females, and vascular dementia tends to be more common in males.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	23	 A meta-analysis of incidence studies (6) across different nationalities showed little difference in overall gender-specific incidence.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	24	 AD incidence for women showed a steeper age-incidence curve, indicating a higher incidence at older ages.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	25	 East Asian countries had lower AD incidence than Europe or the U.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	26	, but their incidence curve steepens with age, which may reflect environmental or genetic differences contributing to AD risk.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	27	The issue of AD in the oldest old (over age 85 yr) has also been investigated, with particular reference to whether AD is an inevitable part of aging (7).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Genetic marker studies involving apolipoprotein E (Apo E), whose e4 allele is a well established disease risk modifier (see below), have also suggested that the vast majority of Apo E e4 carriers will be demented by age 120 yr, although the incidence curves also become flatter after age 90 yr.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Jorm and Jolly (6) found no evidence of incidence curve flattening after age 90 yr.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	30	 These studies are beginning to provide scientific basis for anecdotes suggesting that great longevity need not be accompanied by inevitable deterioration of cognition.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	31	Studies in developing nations have produced interesting results regarding gender issues and environmental and genetic risks for AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	32	 In rural elderly in Northern India, Chandra et al.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	33	 found no gender or literacy association, although prevalence increased with age (8).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	34	 A low prevalence and incidence were been found in Ibadan, Nigeria compared to that in African-Americans in Indianapolis, IN (8.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A cross-cultural study of Japanese-American men living in Hawaii found that height correlated negatively with dementia prevalence, suggesting that early life dietary adequacy may play a role in late-onset brain disorders (10).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Studies are currently underway in geographically or genetically isolated populations, such as Central Kenya, Brazil, and Israeli Arabs, and many others that may help determine whether genetic or environmental factors, such as toxins, literacy and education, physical activity, nicotine exposure, or other variables are important in determining AD development (11, 12, 13).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	37	 One methodological issue in all of these studies, especially in developing nations, is the censuring effect of competing sources of mortality, which would tend to favor AD expression in women.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	38	 More subtly, the life experiences of women, their educational and vocational opportunities, their access to health care, medications, and disease exposures may affect their risks of AD in ways that current research is only beginning to comprehend.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	39	Beginning with the observation that individuals with Down s syndrome almost universally develop neuropathological and frequently clinical evidence of AD by age 35 yr and the discovery of familial forms of AD, interest in the genetic risk factors for AD has been an active field of investigation.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To date, three AD genes have been isolated: mutations of the amyloid precursor protein on chromosome 21 (21q21), of presenilin-1 on chromosome 14 (14q24.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	41	3), and of presenilin-2 on chromosome 1 (1q31.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	42	 These rare mutations have generated new insights into the molecular biology of AD in terms of amyloid processing and differential processing of the APP, but are clinically very rare.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The most important AD gene identified to date is the disease risk modifier, Apo E (19q13.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	44	2), particularly the presence of the e4 allele (14, 15).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Apo E e4 status has been associated with both late-onset and early-onset familial forms of AD, as well as being a general risk factor for AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Individuals carrying at least one e4 allele have between a 25 to 40% lifetime chance of developing AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In a meta-analysis of Apo E and AD studies, women who have at least one e4 allele appear to be at greater risk for AD, with the strongest effects occurring between age 50 to 75 yr (16).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Caucasian women with the e3/e4 genotype were 1.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	49	5 times more likely to develop AD than males with that genotype.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Similar results were seen with women possessing an e2/e4 genotype, but due to sample size considerations they did not reach statistical significance.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Apo E does not appear to be as strong an AD risk factor in African-American or Hispanic samples, but among Hispanic women, sex-related trends similar to those in Caucasian samples are detected.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	52	 This gender effect was not seen in Japanese women in the meta-analysis study.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	53	 The reason for this genetic sexual dimorphism is unclear, but it may represent an interaction with postmenopausal ERT or possibly a sex-specific susceptibility among e3/e4 heterozygotes (17).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Women with a positive family history and an e4 allele may also have an earlier age at onset (18).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	55	Besides aging, a large number of environmental risk factors have been investigated.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Particular interest has focused on whether certain exposures may be protective, such as the relationship of education to the concept of functional neuronal reserve, and the commonly held idea of "use it or lose it.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	57	" The results of epidemiological studies are inconsistent, but protective risk factors may include postmenopausal ERT, smoking, more education, and chronic exposure to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Positive risk factors include history of depression, head injury (particularly in individuals with the Apo E e4 allele), and possibly thyroid disease.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	59	ERT has been shown to be protective for developing AD in a number of studies and appears to be a dose-related phenomenon (19, 20, 21).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Exposure of only 1 yr postmenopausally appears to provide some risk reduction in terms of both disease development and age of onset, even many years later.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The crude odds ratio for ERT exposure in the New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore studies has been about 0.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	62	 The relative risk reduction from ERT may interact with other risk factors, such as Apo E genotype, smoking, and history of AD in first degree relatives.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	63	 The public health aspects of this have begun to be investigated, and more study is needed to determine whether agents such as selective estrogen receptor modulators will produce similar effects.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Judging from the experience with ERT use in cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, it may take many years to understand the full implications on a risk-benefit basis, but the impact of AD is often so catastrophic that further study is necessary.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The role of ERT in acute treatment of established AD is discussed below.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	66	The biology of how ERT can modify AD development is complex, with probably several components interacting.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	67	 These include the importance of estrogen in normal brain development, the presence of estrogen receptors in brain areas important to memory systems such as hippocampus, estrogen-induced changes in Apo E messenger ribonucleic acid expression, increased cerebral blood flow, trophic effects on neuronal systems, and interactions with the basal forebrain cholinergic system, which degenerates in AD and is a major therapeutic target for treatment.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Estrogens have been shown to be involved in axonal elongation, enhancing the outgrowth of nerve cell processes in vitro and promoting the formation of synapses and dendritic spines.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	69	The clinical expression of AD is quite variable, with diagnostic criteria requiring a mixture of memory deficits in addition to deficits in other aspects of cognition, such as language, praxis, agnosia, or executive function disturbance (e.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	70	 planning, abstraction, and judgment).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Behavioral manifestations are common and include depression, agitation, delusions, and hallucinations, or anxiety syndromes.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Sleep disorders and purposeless behaviors such as pacing may also occur in individual patients.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Few studies have addressed the gender specificity of clinical expression.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Studies of gender difference in AD need to be interpreted cautiously in light of underlying gender differences in lateralization and visual-spatial and language abilities occurring in normal development.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	75	In a longitudinal study of AD patients compared to normal elderly, female AD patients performed worse than male AD patients on tests of naming, vocabulary, and word recognition skills, but not on syntactic measures (22).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	76	 These deficits persisted during longitudinal follow-up and contrast with no gender differences in these measures in normal elderly.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Henderson and Buckwalter (23, 24) also found gender differences on the Mini-Mental status examination score related to language dysfunction.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	78	 No gender differences were found using the Blessed test (a cognitive screening instrument), and the rate of deterioration was similar in both sexes (25).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	79	The biological basis for this difference in language abilities in AD may be due to several factors.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	80	 AD women have a much stronger correlation of disease state with postdexamethasone cortisol levels than men (26).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Regional cerebral blood flows measured by positron emission tomography in AD have been described, with women having higher mean nonweighted metabolic rates than men (27).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The explanations for these phenomena include differences in the regional pattern of cell loss and ss-amyloid deposition, which is coupled to regional cerebral blood flow.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Dexamethasone resistance has been associated with damage to the hippocampal formation, which is intimately involved in short term memory processing (28).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Baseline differences in neural organization, such as increased lateralization in males, may influence patterns of language breakdown, becoming magnified with disease progression.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	85	The Nun study also showed the importance of early life experiences and possible interactions with genetic background.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Linguistic abilities, as measured by an analysis of idea density and grammatical complexity in an autobiographical essay written on entrance to a convent, predicted late life cognitive outcome.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Among 14 sisters who died, AD was present in all with low linguistic ability but in none of those with a high degree of linguistic complexity (29).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	88	Noncognitive symptoms may also show gender differences.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Males tend to have more problems with verbal aggressiveness, preoccupation with bodily function, and apathy.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In multiple regression model analysis of the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale, there were no gender differences in behavior severity.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	91	 However, males scored higher on scales of apathy and vegetative signs, whereas females showed more reclusive behavior and emotional lability, with behaviors such as hoarding, refusing help, and inappropriate laughter and crying (30).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Differences in baseline behavior may contribute to these findings, and differences in levels of androgens and estrogens may play a role in behavioral expression.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	93	The identification of Apo E, its role in cholesterol transport, and its risk factor status for cardiovascular disease have led to a reappraisal of the role of vascular factors in AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Although ss-amyloid is found in meningeal vessels, no consistent evidence of a systemic amyloidosis has been identified in AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Cerebral ischemia may complicate AD, leading to decrements in neuropsychological performance and faster clinical progression, as suggested by the findings in the Nun study (31).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	96	Overall disease survival from onset and diagnosis is variable, but averages between 8 to 10 yr.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Many investigators have used age at onset or particular clinical features to investigate the possibility of AD subgroups, but these have not been shown to have consistent biological validity.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Factors associated with quicker progression include the presence of family history, onset at an early age, extrapyramidal symptoms, psychosis, and comorbid medical conditions.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	99	 In our study of two large cohorts, smoking did not affect disease survival (32).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	100	 (33) found men had shorter survival times than women, with shorter male survival associated with more psychiatric symptomatology.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Among women, but not men, a history of cardiovascular disease was associated with poorer survival.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	102	The major basis for current pharmacological treatment of AD is based on the cholinergic hypothesis.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The cholinergic system radiates from basal forebrain nuclei and degenerates early in AD, and cholinergic markers correlate with disease course.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Enhancement of cholinergic function by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors has been demonstrated to improve cognitive functioning compared to the effect of placebo and may have effects on noncognitive symptoms and vegetative symptoms as well (34, 35).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A retrospective review of data from the 30-week tacrine trial (36) showed that the most robust improvements in neuropsychological testing occurred in women with concurrent ERT or recent treatment (within 3 months of trial enrollment) (37).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	106	The cognitive effects of ERT have been investigated in a number of human models since the 1950s.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In surgically or naturally menopausal women, ERT has been associated with enhanced short and long term memory and increased capacity for learning paired associations.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Visual memory, however, does not improve with ERT (38).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In women aged 32 to 36 yr old with uterine myomas given a GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) for 12 weeks, verbal memory scores declined significantly.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	110	 This was followed by GnRH-a with estrogen or placebo, with the former group showing improvements to baseline verbal scores but continued poorer performance in the GnRH-a and placebo cohort.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	111	 These results suggest that estrogen deprivation effects are reversible with replacement, at least in the short term (39).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	112	Serum levels of endogenous estrogens are not consistently correlated with cognitive performance in older women (40).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Animal studies using paradigms such as ovariectomized animals and standardized behavioral tests have shown a wide variety of interactions of estrogens with cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems important for modulating memory, mood, and affect (41, 42, 43, 44, 45).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	114	 Estrogens also facilitate hippocampal neuronal long term potentiation, a model for memory formation (46); protect against memory-impairing compounds, such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines (44, 47, 48); and reduce neuronal responses to oxidative stress (49).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Human studies have shown conflicting results in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, with most studies showing only a modest effect on selected neuropsychological variables such as explicit memory or visual-spatial skills, but not immediate memory (50, 51, 52, 53).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	116	 It is likely that the memory-promoting effects of acute estrogen replacement derive from its pleiotropic action in the central nervous system, including interactions with estrogen receptors with changes in gene expression, as well as up-regulation of other neurotransmitter systems, as indicated by extensive data from animal models.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	117	In patients with established cognitive impairment, early open label studies and more recent randomized studies using current AD diagnostic criteria have showed trends toward improvements in several neuropsychological and behavioral ratings.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	118	 However, many of these studies have been quite small and of relatively short duration ( < 6 months) (54).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	119	 A larger, longer, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study in established AD women is underway, and results will be available shortly.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	120	Implicit in the progressive deterioration of cognitive and self-care abilities in AD is the reality that care will be rendered to assist the patient with activities of daily living.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Even in the United States, with its well developed system of long term care facilities for dementia patients, it is estimated that 80% of care occurs in the informal home setting.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The most consistent finding in care-giving research is that the majority of family care-givers are women, providing approximately two thirds of care for AD patients.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	123	 This compares to 80 to 90% of care provided by women among adult child care-givers.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	124	 In studying the content of care-giving, women are more likely than men to carry out personal care activities, such as bathing, dressing, or personal hygiene.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	125	 Women are more likely to attend to household chores and are equally likely to deal with money management compared to men (55).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	126	Long term care in nursing facilities may be necessary in the later stages of AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Major determinants of institutionalization include incontinence, behavioral disturbance, strength of the care-giving bond (spouses are most likely to continue home care), as well as underlying social and cultural values.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Besides the moral and cultural issues, the cost to society for long term care has led to programs to enhance the home care system, reducing care-giver burden and attempting to forestall spousal and family impoverishment frequently imposed by the tremendous costs of long term care.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Attempts to change this at the level of national health care programs, such as Medicare, have not been instituted to date.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	130	Studies focusing on the burdens of care-giving have generally identified that women experience more distress as a result of this role, which may relate to the content of the role as well as the long term stress-coping mechanisms.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Although the acute effects of care-giving, such as anger, guilt, and depression, are well known and can clearly affect the quality of care, long term health effects of care-giving in AD are less documented (56).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	132	Two endocrine aspects are relevant to care-giving.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	133	 A voluminous literature exists on biological measures of stress, such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity, but relatively little is known about ways to quantify the actions of care-giving and to correlate with stress markers.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Chronic glucocorticoid exposure from hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation may damage hippocampal neurons, (28) possibly lending a biological basis to the neuropsychiatric hazards associated with care-giving.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The effects of ERT as an adjunct to mood maintenance via interactions with serotoninergic and adrenergic systems suggest that ERT may augment the antidepressant drug response (57).
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	136	AD is a major public health problem, and demographic trends have led to its being called the epidemic of the century.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Because of increased longevity and the special challenges of ERT, women are well placed to both be at risk for and the beneficiaries of advances in AD therapy.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Overall increases in health consciousness may impact future AD risk, and it is encouraging that women frequently outnumber men in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents in AD.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	139	 The risk of AD from environmental exposures in the overall life experiences of women is unclear.
0.26628628.10372669.html.plaintext.txt	140	 To the extent that education and work promote the development of brain areas such as the association cortex that are preferentially affected in AD, creating a neuronal reserve, advances in women s overall place in society may further help protect them from the ravages of AD.

0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	2	Liddell et al (2001) reviewed what knowledge we have on the genetic epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease for the purpose of informing relatives of patients about their own risks.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	3	 We read their review with interest; however, we disagree on several points.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	4	First, in many cases of late-onset dementia, differentiating between the common causes of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is difficult.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	5	 In everyday clinical practice even differentiating Alzheimer's disease from Lewy-body disease and frontal temporal dementia is not always feasible.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	6	 To what extent these distinctions are relevant to genetic counselling with respect to late-onset dementia is not clear.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	7	Second, the very high prevalence of dementia found in centenarians (Asada et al, 1996; Blansjaar et al, 2000) is not the only argument against a slowing down of the rate of increase in dementia over 85, 90 or 95 years of age.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Meta-analyses, not included in the review, did not find evidence for such a slowing down (Gao et al, 1998; Jorm  and  Jolley, 1998).
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Therefore, the prevalence of dementia almost certainly increases substantially, exceeding 15% from the age of 85.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	10	Most investigations attributed some three-quarters of late-onset dementia to Alzheimer's disease.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We agree that the literature indicates a three- to fourfold risk in first-degree relatives of patients with late-onset dementia (seven- to eightfold with two affected first-degree relatives).
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	12	 We can only conclude that this leads to a risk of one in three, if not higher, for those first-degree relatives who reach the age of 85 years.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Obfuscating this information by showing graphs to anxious relatives is, in our opinion, not an appropriate reassurance.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	14	 We feel that better consolation can be effected by proffering the view that most people do not reach the age of 85, and by explaining the slowly progressive course of most cases of late-onset dementia.

0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	28	For the most part, the points of disagreement that Drs Blansjaar and van Schaick raise are differences more of emphasis than of substance.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	29	True, the diagnosis of the type of dementia, particularly in late old age, is not always easy.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Dementia in later life is probably best described as a syndrome, the emergence of clinical dementia being dependent upon the interplay of two or more pathologies.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The  Nun Study  by Snowdon et al (1997) is probably one of the best demonstrations of this.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Yet, it is believed that Alzheimer's disease is a major cause of dementia in later life.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Even without having seen the patient, one is going to be correct in a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, or Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease, 75% of the time.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Rarer diagnoses, such as frontal temporal dementia and Lewy-body disease, should suggest themselves if they are kept in mind, a careful history taken and the patient followed-up so that departures from the normal symptom progression for Alzheimer's disease are noted.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Of course, mistakes in diagnosis will occur, but we think that this will occur insufficiently frequently to compromise the very broad-brush approach to estimating the familial risk of dementia that we have advocated.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	36	As to whether the rate of increase in the incidence and prevalence of dementia begins to slow or goes on increasing exponentially into extreme old age, this is a controversial area, which is, in fact, also highlighted in the two meta-analyses cited by Drs Blansjaar and van Schaick.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Jorm  and  Jolley (1998) suggest that "the incidence rises exponentially up to the age of 90 years".
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Gao et al (1998) suggest that "the acceleration of incidence rates for AD and dementia slows down with the increase in age, although we find no evidence of a rate decline".
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Faced with such difficulties of interpretation, we can only commend the clarity of Blansjaar et al's own study (2000), which suggests that the increase in dementia prevalence does not slow down in extreme old age.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	40	We agree that the risk of a first-degree relative of a proband with Alzheimer's disease developing the disorder once they reach the age of 85 may be one in three, if not higher.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Perhaps this point could have been made more clearly in our review.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The main point we tried to make was that the actual likelihood of surviving to age 85 and developing Alzheimer's disease is lower.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	43	 We disagree that showing graphs to anxious relatives is "obfuscating this information", but we accept that Drs Blansjaar and van Schaick and, indeed, other clinicians may think differently.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	44	In non-Mendelian Alzheimer's disease it is difficult to estimate how much the risk increases as the number of affected first-degree relatives goes up, principally because few studies have addressed this issue.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	45	 However, the  conjugal Alzheimer's disease  study of Bird et al (1993), which we cited, and the transmission study of Farrer et al (1990), which we did not cite, indicate that the risk increases substantially.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	46	 With such pedigrees showing apparently high genetic loading for Alzheimer's disease, we suggested that a psychiatrist seek the advice of a clinical geneticist.
0.25853837.11435273.html.plaintext.txt	47	Finally, we agree that it is often reassuring to point out that the course of dementia in late old age is usually more slowly progressive and more benign than dementia occurring in a younger person.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	8	Method We studied the APOE genotypes of 24 adults with dementia and 33 non-demented adults with Down's syndrome over 35 years of age, and an additional group of 164 non-learning disabled adults.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We also carried out a meta-analysis of all previously published studies of association between APOE and Down's syndrome, incorporating the current data.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	10	Results We observed a non-significant excess of APOE 4 and a reduction of 2 in adults with dementia compared with non-demented adults with Down's syndrome in our sample.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	11	 However, meta-analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of 4 in adults with dementia compared with non-demented adults with Down's syndrome (odds ratio=2.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	15	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Autopsy studies have shown that adults with Down's syndrome aged 40 years and above almost universally exhibit Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (Mann, 1988), a fact that is supported by neuro-imaging studies (Deb et al, 1992).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Saunders et al (1993) reported an association between APOE 4 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Our study examined whether the age specific manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome was influenced by risk factors such as age, APOE status, and genotype for an intronic polymorphism in the PS-1 gene, which is also reputedly associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease (Kehoe et al, 1996).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We examined the APOE polymorphism in three groups: (a) a population-based sample of adults with dementia with Down's syndrome aged 35 years and over; (b) an elderly group of non-demented adults with Down's syndrome drawn from the same population-based sample; and (c) a group of normal non-demented adults selected for intelligence, collected from the same geographical area as the first two groups.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	20	 We also carried out a meta-analysis comprising all published studies of association between the APOE gene and Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome, incorporating the data from the current study.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The diagnosis of dementia was further supported by using two observer-rated questionnaires, namely the Dementia Questionnaire for Mentally Retarded Persons (DMR) (Evenhuis, 1992) and the Dementia Scale for Down's syndrome (DSDS) (Gedye, 1995).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Both questionnaires are reported to have good inter-rater reliability and internal validity (Evenhuis, 1992; Gedye, 1995).

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	34	 As the prevalence of dementia in adults with Down's syndrome tends to increase with age (Lai  and  Williams, 1989), it is anticipated that those who have lived longer without manifesting clinical dementia have least risk factors for developing dementia, and therefore provides an appropriate group for comparison.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	69	 A comparison of ages of onset in those with and without an 4 allele was not statistically significant.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	70	Meta-analysis Prasher et al (1997) presented a meta-analysis of the data collected from all the known published papers in addition to their own data in relation to APOE status in adults with Down's syndrome with and without Alzheimer's disease.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	71	 We have added data from two other recent studies (Sekijama et al, 1998; Tyrell et al, 1998), and our current study to those analysed by Prasher et al (1997) and this is presented in Table 4.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	72	 However, we excluded Wisniewski et al's (1995) data, which were included in Prasher et al's (1997) meta-analysis, because unlike all the other studies they diagnosed Alzheimer's disease on the basis of neuropathological findings alone in the absence of any clinical data.

0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Similarly a slightly lower frequency of the protective 2 alleles was observed among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The small cohort size of the current study reduced the statistical power for this study (24% power at 5% level) to detect an effect size of that reported previously.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	83	 However, in this study the age-matching of two groups of patients with Down's syndrome one of which had dementia, was done in such a way so as to increase its sensitivity and thus lessen the influence of this statistical weakness.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	84	Meta-analysis To increase the possibility of detecting small effect sizes, we collated data from all known published studies of association between APOE status in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This was the method employed recently by Prasher et al (1997) that showed no evidence to support an involvement of APOE.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	86	 However, the meta-analysis reported here, showed a statistically significant excess of the APOE 4 allele among the subjects with dementia when compared with the non-demented group of adults with Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, we did not observe a significant reduction of APOE 2 alleles among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	88	Certain factors may have influenced the outcome of the meta-analysis in the current study as well as in Prasher et al's (1997) study.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	89	 It is likely that the age difference in the cohorts used in the previous studies (Table 4) is a factor that may have introduced errors into the results of meta-analysis.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	90	 The age range of subjects included in these studies varied, in that some used age 18 whereas others used age 35, 40 and 50 respectively as the minimum age for inclusion in the study.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If APOE is responsible for earlier age of onset of Alzheimer's disease, this differential rate of age range among the different cohorts will make the interpretation of meta-analysis difficult.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	92	 The lack of appropriately matched control group is another likely source of bias.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Only the current study, Tyrell et al's (1998) study and van Gool et al's (1995) study matched the dementia group with the non-dementia group.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Prasher et al's (1997) study while not originally matched demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the age and the gender distribution.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The cohort size is also a likely source of error.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Apart from the current study, only two other studies (see Table 4) included 20 or more adults with dementia in their cohort.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Another source of error is the use of different diagnostic criteria for defining dementia in different studies.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Some used formal tools like the DMR scale (Evenhuis, 1992) and Adaptive Behaviour Scale (Nihira et al, 1974), whereas others made their diagnosis on the basis of clinical findings alone.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	99	Age of onset of Alzheimer's disease In the current study, a regression analysis unequivocally showed an influence of ageing on the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Age is a well-known risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease in both the general population and in the adults with Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This effect seems more pronounced among the adults with Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Some have suggested that age of death among adults with Down's syndrome is influenced by the APOE status.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In Hardy et al's (1994) autopsy study, the Down's syndrome cases showing Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and who had an APOE 4 (n=10) allele, tended to die at a younger age (age of death ranged between 48 and 60 years, mean 54, s.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	104	=6) than those who had an 2 allele (n=2) (age of death 69 and 76 years respectively).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A similar trend was also reported by both Royston et al (1994) and Mann et al (1995) based on their small cohort studies.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Some suggested that APOE status also influences the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in the general population (Corder et al, 1993).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	107	 However, the findings of the current study do not suggest such trend among cases of Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Considering the small cohort size included for the analysis of age of onset data in the current study, a Type II error is likely to influence the out-come.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	109	 As early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease could be difficult to detect in adults with Down's syndrome, it is difficult to be precise about the exact age of onset of Alzheimer's disease in this cohort.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	110	The frequency of APOE 4 allele distribution among the adults with dementia and Down's syndrome in different studies mentioned in Table 4 varied between 12.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	111	4%, apart from Prasher et al's (1997) study, which showed a much lower (5.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	112	9%) frequency than that expected in the general population.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In contrast, the frequency of APOE 2 alleles varied widely between 0% in the current study, and that of Schupf et al's (1996) and Tyrell et al's (1998), to the 11.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	114	8% observed in Prasher et al's (1997) study, which is higher than expected even for the general population.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The frequency of 2 allele among the non-demented subjects with Down's syndrome was on average much higher than that expected in the general population, with a wide range between 2.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	116	3% in Sekijima et al's (1998) study and 50% in Royston et al's (1994) study.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	117	 Overall these data are indicative of APOE 4 being a risk factor for the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	118	APOE 4 and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in Down's syndrome The findings of autopsy studies of patients with Down's syndrome, however, show a somewhat unclear relationship between APOE 4 and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in this population.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	119	 For example, in Wisniewski et al's (1995) autopsy study of brains of 40 subjects with Down's syndrome (of whom 15 showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology), only one 21-year-old subject had an APOE 4 allele (34 genotype) and his brain did not show the Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	120	 In Mann et al's (1995) study of 20 brains of subjects with Down's syndrome, all of whom showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, only 35% (n=7) had APOE 4 allele (one with 24 and six with 34).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Similarly, in Hardy et al's (1994) series of 22 autopsy brains of subjects with Down's syndrome, all of whom showed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, 45% (n=10) had APOE 4 (all with 34 allele).
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Further research is needed to clarify this apparent discrepancy perhaps by using immunoneuropathological techniques.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	123	 It is also important to explore the exact mechanism by which APOE 4 may influence the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome subjects.
0.24538012.10912224.html.plaintext.txt	124	 However, it is well known that despite the increased risk associated with the 4 allele, the presence of 4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of Alzheimer's disease (Blacker  and  Tanzi, 1998).

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	6	 A cohort of 931 nondemented subjects aged =" BORDER="0">75 years from the Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, was followed for 3 years between 1987 and 1993.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	7	 A total of 101 incident cases of dementia, 76 involving AD, were detected.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Less-educated subjects had an adjusted relative risk of developing AD of 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	9	0), and subjects with lower SES had an adjusted relative risk of 1.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	10	 When both education and SES were introduced into the same model, only education remained significantly associated with AD.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Combinations of low education with low or high SES were associated with similar increased risks of AD, but well-educated subjects with low SES were not at high risk.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Low SES at 20 years of age, even when SES was high at age 40 or 60 years, was associated with increased risk; however, this increase disappeared when education was entered into the model.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In conclusion, the association between low education and increased AD risk was not mediated by adult SES or socioeconomic mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	14	 This suggests that early life factors may be relevant.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	17	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Several studies have reported an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer s disease among less-educated persons (1 to 10).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Different mechanisms have been suggested to explain this association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Katzman (5) proposed that education might increase brain reserves by increasing synaptic density in the neocortical association cortex.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	20	 (6) extended the cognitive reserve hypothesis and took into account the possible beneficial influence of mental activity throughout the entire life span, where occupational attainment along with level of education could influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Education might also be a surrogate measure for an intellectual outlook (7), as well as a proxy for intelligence, which in turn could be inversely related to the risk of Alzheimer s disease (8, 9).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, the issue of a possible detection bias due to later diagnosis of dementia in highly educated subjects has been raised (4, 10).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	23	It is known that education is an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Different studies have shown high (11) to moderate (2) correlations between education and occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Nevertheless, these two variables represent different aspects of and periods in the life course and may generate differences in health through various mechanisms (11, 12).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Lynch and Kaplan describe education as "the transition from a socio-economic position largely received from parents to an achieved socio-economic position as an adult" (13, p.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	27	Socioeconomic factors acting over the life course have been found to affect health and premature death, as well as risk of cardiovascular disease (14, 15).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Cumulative economic hardship has been found to lead to poorer cognitive functioning (16).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	29	 (17) examined the relation between socioeconomic mobility and cognitive function among Finish men in late middle age and suggested that all stages of the life course play a role in influencing adult cognitive function.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	30	Few studies have reported an association between adult SES based on occupation and the incidence of Alzheimer s disease or dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	31	 (2) found that all of the investigated markers of SES (education, occupational prestige, and income) predicted the development of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It has been reported that manual work, when it involves production of goods, could increase the risk of clinical Alzheimer s disease or dementia (18).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	33	 However, these studies focused on principal occupation, not all occupational periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In addition, the relation of social mobility through different socioeconomic levels over the life course to the risk of dementia in old age has not been studied.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	35	The general aim of this study was to determine whether the reported association between low education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia could be explained by occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Specifically, we examined how the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia varied by different combinations of 1) education and main occupation-based SES and 2) education and lifetime number of years spent in a low occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Since education and occupation-based SES are interrelated, special attention was given to the categories that deviated from the expected pattern, that is, the combinations of high education/low occupation-based SES and low education/high occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Furthermore, we investigated social mobility patterns to explore whether later advancement or setbacks in occupation-based SES may affect the relation between education and Alzheimer s disease incidence.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	39	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Study population The study population was derived from the Kungsholmen Project, a community-based longitudinal study of aging and dementia in Stockholm, Sweden.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	40	 All registered inhabitants of the Kungsholmen district of Stockholm who were aged 75 years or older on October 1, 1987, were invited to participate in the project.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Among the 1,810 persons who agreed to participate and signed an informed consent form at the baseline examination (1987 to 1989), 1,473 (361 men and 1,112 women) were diagnosed as being free of dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	42	 At baseline, detection of prevalent cases of dementia was conducted using a two-phase design.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	43	 All subjects were given a brief psychometric test as a screening test for dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Persons who screened positive (were suspected to have dementia) and a random sample of subjects who screened negative (were not suspected to have dementia) were clinically examined (19).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The same diagnostic criteria and procedure for diagnosing dementia were used at baseline and at follow-up, as described below.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	46	 At the time of the follow-up examination (1991 to 1993), 150 subjects refused to participate and 22 had moved out of the Stockholm area.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Information about lifetime occupational history was unavailable for 370 subjects because of refusal by the informant.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Therefore, the current study population consisted of 931 persons.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	49	Identification of incident cases of Alzheimer s disease and dementia At follow-up, all subjects were clinically examined by physicians, neuropsychologically assessed by psychologists, and interviewed by nurses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Incident cases of dementia were defined as those that developed during the follow-up period.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	51	 The diagnosis of clinical dementia was made according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (20), using a three-step procedure.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	52	 First, a preliminary diagnosis was made by the examining physician.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Second, all cases were independently reviewed by a specialized clinician, and a second diagnosis was made.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	54	 If the diagnoses were in agreement, they were accepted as final.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	55	 In cases of disagreement, a third opinion was obtained, and the concordant diagnosis was accepted.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The diagnosis of dementia was made when the subject completely fulfilled the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	57	The diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease in particular required gradual onset and progressive deterioration of cognitive functioning and exclusion of all other specific causes of dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Neuroimaging and autopsy data were not available.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Our clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease corresponds to the diagnosis of "probable Alzheimer s disease" according to the NINCDS-ADRDA [National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer s Disease and Related Disorders Association] criteria (21).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	60	 For the 161 deceased subjects, a preliminary diagnosis was made by a physician who consulted medical records and death certificates, and the diagnosis was then reviewed by a senior clinician.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	61	 When only discharge diagnoses from hospitals (n = 50) or only death certificates (n = 11) were available, the reported diagnosis was accepted.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	62	 When we repeated the analyses in the survivors  cohort, the results were similar.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	63	Measurement of educational attainment Information on total years of formal education was collected at baseline.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In this study, educational level was divided into two main categories: 2 to 7 years (6 years of primary school and, in some cases, 1 extra year of practical vocational training) and =" BORDER="0">8 years (intermediate and university levels).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	65	 This dichotomization was based on a previous analysis (4) in which different levels of education were examined in relation to Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Persons with an intermediate amount of education (8 to 10 years of schooling) did not differ from university-educated subjects (=" BORDER="0">11 years of schooling) in terms of Alzheimer s disease risk.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Data on educational background were missing for three persons.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	68	 These subjects were omitted from all analyses concerning education.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	69	Assessments of occupation-based SES Main occupation-based SES Specially trained nurses interviewed a relative or another person significant to the subject about the subject s full lifetime work history.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	70	 The questionnaire was developed by an occupational hygienist.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Up to eight occupational periods with specific information regarding time and place were listed.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	72	 The subject s longest-held job was considered his or her main occupation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Occupations were grouped according to the socioeconomic classification system developed by Statistics Sweden (22).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The Swedish socioeconomic classification system primarily contains dimensions of ownership of the means of production and division into blue-collar and white-collar occupations as assessed by normal trade-union affiliation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	75	 It also contains aspects of skills in the subdivisions inside blue-collar and white-collar occupational categories.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	76	 However, customary educational requirements for the respective occupations are used, not information about education at the individual level.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	77	Quite a few women (21 percent) were homemakers during their longest occupational period.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Information on husband s occupation, which is frequently used to estimate the SES of wives, was not available.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Instead of including homemakers in a category of their own, we used their second-longest-held job to estimate their SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Eighteen subjects had been housewives throughout their working lives and were excluded from the analyses involving main occupation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	81	We first analyzed the relation of SES to incidence of Alzheimer s disease and dementia by using three categories (blue-collar workers, white-collar employees, and self-employed persons plus those in academic professions).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Since the two last categories had similar risks, the two groups were merged.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	83	Lifetime occupational SES Data were gathered about the length of each occupational period over the subject s lifetime, and all occupations were classified as described above, with the exception that no substitutions from other occupational periods could be made for the homemaker work periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Instead they were classified as nonmanual periods, because 1) these women often held nonmanual jobs in their other occupational periods and 2) they were generally more highly educated than the nonhousewives.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Finally, we added up the numbers of years in all periods of manual labor to obtain the sum of years spent in a low occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	86	 In the current study, we report results from analyses in which the number of years in a low SES was less than or equal to 25 versus more than 25 (the median amount of time spent in a low SES by the low-SES fraction of the population).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	87	Socioeconomic mobility We computed occupation-based SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years in order to estimate individual socioeconomic mobility patterns.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	88	 When information about a particular time period was missing, we substituted an equal number of years from the two closest work periods.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Sixty-three persons lacked information about occupational position at 60 years of age; instead, information concerning the occupational period prior to that was chosen to represent it.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	90	Covariates We used all covariates with available information from our database that may have acted as confounding factors.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	91	 As major possible confounders, we considered age, gender, vascular diseases, and alcohol data.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	92	Information on age and gender was derived from the Swedish National Population Register.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Information on cerebrovascular and heart diseases and diabetes mellitus was derived from the computerized Stockholm Inpatient Registry System, in which all admission and discharge diagnoses from every hospital in Stockholm are recorded.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In the current study, all diagnoses made at any time from 1969 to the baseline examination were used.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Diseases were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (codes 430 to 438 for cerebrovascular disease, codes 410 to 414 for coronary disease, code 428 for heart failure, code 427 for arrhythmia, and code 250 for diabetes mellitus).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Information on diabetes from the in-patient register was integrated with self-reports of a doctor s diagnosis of diabetes, use of oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin, or a blood glucose level greater than 11 mmol/liter.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Arterial blood pressure was measured at baseline with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained nurses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	98	 If the first reading was abnormal (systolic pressure =" BORDER="0">160 mmHg or diastolic pressure =" BORDER="0">95 mmHg), two additional readings were made.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The mean of the second and third readings was used for analyses (23).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Furthermore, we created a simple additive index ranging from 0 to 5 for the vascular diseases or risk factors described above.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	101	Information on alcohol use was collected from relatives, who specified how many glasses of wine, bottles of beer, and/or glasses of liquor the proband consumed weekly.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Since consumption of alcohol in this predominantly female elderly population was found to be particularly low (82.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	103	4 percent of the persons with available data on alcohol reported that they used no alcohol at all, and only 3.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	104	5 percent consumed an amount corresponding to more than five glasses of wine per week), we decided to divide the alcohol data into three categories: no use, any use, and no information.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The latter category was included in the analyses because reporting on alcohol use can sometimes be a sensitive matter, and we found it relevant to investigate whether the absence of information was associated with the risk of dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	106	Other covariates, which were controlled for in further analyses, were: 1) cognitive status at baseline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (24); 2) social network at baseline, measured with a four-grade index (poor, limited, moderate, and rich social network) as defined in a previous study (25); and 3) engagement in mental and physical activities at baseline, graded in three frequency categories (26).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	107	Statistical analysis Logistic regression was used to evaluate the differences in baseline characteristics between participants and dropouts.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the relative risk of incident Alzheimer s disease and dementia associated with different combinations of education and occupation-based SES, as well as socioeconomic mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The follow-up time for nondemented persons was estimated from the date of the baseline interview to the date of follow-up examination or death.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	110	 For the demented persons, half of this time was calculated, since dementia onset was assumed to be the midpoint between baseline and follow-up examination.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	111	Age, gender, vascular disease index, and alcohol use were entered into all models.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Additional models were used to verify the possible confounding effect of baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score, social network, and leisure activities.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	113	 We also repeated all analyses after excluding the stroke cases, with the purpose of examining whether stroke might obscure or increase diagnostic difficulties in dementia due to cognitive dysfunction in subjects with previous stroke.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	114	The interrelation between education and SES was explored using two stratifications.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	115	 First, the study population was divided into four strata characterized by 1) high education and high SES; 2) high education and low SES; 3) low education and high SES; and 4) low education and low SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Second, we used four strata by combining low and high education as defined above, with permanence in low SES for less than or equal to 25 years versus more than 25 years.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	127	 Compared with persons with a high level of education (=" BORDER="0">11 years), the adjusted relative risks of dementia of the Alzheimer s type and dementia of all types were similar for subjects with an intermediate amount (8 to 10 years) of education and elevated for subjects with a low level (2 to 7 years) of education (see model 1A).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	128	 In model 1B, we merged the high and intermediate levels of education into one reference category.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	129	 In model 1B and model 2, subjects with either a low level of education or a low occupation-based SES were found to be at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, even after adjustment for all covariates examined.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	130	 However, when both education and SES were introduced into the same model simultaneously (table 2, model 3), only low education remained a significant risk factor for Alzheimer s disease and dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	131	 These results were similar for men and women, although the relative risks for men were not statistically significant, probably because of less statistical power.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	133	 The number of persons in the high education/low occupation-based SES group was smaller (n = 36) in comparison with the other groups, and it contained the largest proportion of women (89 percent) and housewives (33 percent).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	134	 The low education/high occupation-based SES group differed noticeably in that 26 percent of its members were self-employed, whereas only 9 percent of persons in the high education/high occupation-based SES group were self-employed.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	135	Low education in combination with either low or high occupation-based SES was associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, even after adjustment for the major covariates.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	140	 High education in conjunction with 25 or more years in a low SES was not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	141	Table 4, model 1, shows the relative risks of Alzheimer s disease in relation to eight social mobility patterns after controlling for age and gender.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Having a low occupation-based SES at ages 20, 40, and 60 years resulted in a borderline-significant elevated risk of Alzheimer s disease compared with the reference category of high SES at all three ages.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Having a low occupation-based SES at ages 20 and 40 years but not at age 60 years was also associated with significantly elevated risks of Alzheimer s disease.

0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	149	 When we repeated all analyses after excluding cases of stroke, the associations between education and Alzheimer s disease and between education and dementia were similar, and all results showed the same patterns as in the main analyses.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	150	   DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The main finding of this study is that a low level of education and a low occupation-based main SES are individually associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, but only low education remains as a risk factor when both variables are examined simultaneously.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	151	 A similar pattern was observed when numbers of years of all work periods in the low-SES position were added together and when life-span individual social mobility patterns were studied.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In comparison with highly educated subjects who had a high-SES main occupation, a twofold increased risk of Alzheimer s disease was detected, not only among less-educated subjects with low SES but also among subjects with low education and a high-SES position.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In addition, subjects with an initially high occupation-based SES had no increased risk of Alzheimer s disease independently of later SES changes, but those persons who had a low occupation-based SES at a young age and remained in this category for most of their occupational life had a 70 to 140 percent increased risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	154	 However, even in this case, low education explained the associations.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	155	Our results are in agreement with previous findings of a positive association between a low level of education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia (1 to 10).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	156	 (2) reported that each of the socioeconomic measures (education, income, and occupational prestige) predicted Alzheimer s disease risk.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, when they included all three measures in the same model, only education (not income or occupational prestige) retained a significant association with Alzheimer s disease.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Recently, investigators from the Nurses  Health Study (27) reported a strong association between low education and cognitive decline but little association with other markers of SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	159	The fact that the association between low education and increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia in general was present independently of main occupation-based SES, and the fact that the association of SES with Alzhei-mer s disease and dementia was mainly due to SES in early work life, seems to indicate that unknown education-related factors acting during the first two decades of life may be involved in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	160	 This interpretation is in agreement with a number of previous reports.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In a recent article, Kaplan et al.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	162	 (28) concluded that higher childhood socioeconomic position, as well as greater educational attainment, was associated with better cognitive function in adulthood.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In a study of education and dementia in an Italian population with a middle-to-high socioeconomic level, the first decade of life was suggested to be a critical period for development of dementia later in life (29).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	164	 (30) discussed the possibility that low education by itself is not a major risk factor for Alzhei-mer s disease but rather a marker for other accompanying deleterious socioeconomic or environmental influences in childhood.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Poor-quality childhood or adolescent environments have been suggested to prevent the brain from reaching complete levels of maturation, which in turn may put people at higher risk of Alzheimer s disease (31, 32).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Results from the PAQUID Study (33) showed that occupation did not change the risk of Alzheimer s disease, which instead was related to cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The early-life factors in question may be early socioeconomic factors, mental stimulation, or cognitive abilities.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The cognitive abilities may be affected by both environmental (34) and genetic influences (9).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Since many studies, like ours, lack an independent measure of intelligence, the importance of early-life cognitive abilities is difficult to evaluate.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	170	A number of studies have given special attention to the effect of early-life circumstances on health and mortality in general.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Early-life SES has been reported to be connected with cardiovascular diseases and general health status later in life (35 to 37).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Disadvantaged childhood living conditions have been hypothesized to trigger unhealthy life trajectories, where increased illness risk is the sum of several health-damaging factors (38).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	173	 New results from a random Swedish national sample indicate that occupational class differences in adult mortality depend, to a fairly large extent, on childhood conditions (39).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	174	 We examined the relation between SES and Alzheimer s disease and dementia from a lifetime perspective, ranging from school to retirement, but unfortunately we lacked specific data on the SES of the family of origin.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Thus, we can only suggest the involvement of early-life factors in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia as a hypothesis.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	176	An alternative explanation for our findings is that education may be a better indicator of adult lifestyle and habits than occupational SES, and that lifestyle and habits such as alcohol use and smoking may explain the detected association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	177	 However, when our data were adjusted for alcohol use, and additionally when current social network index and engagement in physical and mental activities were entered into the model as covariates, we obtained similar results.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Smoking was not related to Alzheimer s disease or dementia in our population (40).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	179	With regard to cognitive function in late middle age, Turrell et al.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	180	 (17) reported that disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances in childhood may, to some extent, be overcome by later upward mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, in our study, low education remained associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease even after adjustment for adult social mobility.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	182	Some potential limitations of this study must be considered.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Persons who dropped out of the study were less educated than participants.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Since low education was related to Alzheimer s disease and dementia, this may have affected our results, but it is more likely to have skewed our findings towards underestimation of the association than towards overestimation.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The occupational data were obtained through informants.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	186	 However, a single open-ended question about occupation (without any specification of time, place, or number of years) had already been posed to the participants during the baseline interview, and it was possible to compare these responses with the informant data regarding the subject s main job.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	187	 When information from the two different sources was used to estimate SES, agreement was 80 percent.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	188	 The Swedish system for classification of SES from occupation is well established and has been evaluated (41).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	189	 However, it remains that occupation-based SES is more difficult to evaluate than education.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Estimation of SES from occupation was difficult for the housewives in the cohort (21 percent).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Our approximations were likely to create nondifferential misclassification of SES, leading to a dilution of the association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	192	 We performed additional analyses (data not shown) treating the housewives as a third occupational category, and this did not affect our results.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	193	Finally, we must be cautious in interpreting our findings as reflecting a direct effect of education on Alzheimer s disease risk and not one that is mediated by occupation-based SES.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	194	 In fact, there is the possibility of unmeasured confounders  being responsible for the patterns of associations found in the study.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	195	 For example, work-related stress may be associated with occupation-based SES but not with education and may increase the risk of Alzheimer s disease and dementia, though there is currently no clear evidence in the literature concerning such an association.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	196	The main conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that a low level of education is more directly associated with increased Alzheimer s disease incidence and is not mediated by low adult occupation-based SES, regardless of whether the low-SES occupational period was extended over a substantial number of years (=" BORDER="0">25 years) and regardless of adult socioeconomic mobility pattern.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	197	 The results are not inconsistent with the already-suggested hypotheses of cognitive or brain reserves (5, 6).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Alternatively, these findings may partly reflect a detection bias by which subjects with a low level of education tend to be clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer s disease and dementia at an earlier point in time (4).
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	199	 However, the possibility that factors related to early-life SES may play a role in the development of Alzheimer s disease and dementia should not be disregarded.
0.23427205.14718220.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Our findings support this hypothesis and stress the importance of collecting data on early life conditions when studying dementia in old age.

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	4	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   The research of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics has been extremely prolific over the past decade, and currently more than 10 genes are reported to show either positive or negative evidence for disease association per month.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Here, we review all 90 studies from 2003 reporting a total of 127 association findings between candidate genes and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	6	 While most positive results were largely contradictory, we identified three loci on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, 11q23 that yielded positive results in three or more independent studies, in addition to the well-established AD association with the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Based on these data, we suggest that it may be prudent for investigators to pay closer attention to issues such as power, replicability and haplotype structure prior to initial publication.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This should serve to greatly decrease the likelihood of false positive and false negative findings reported in future years.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	9	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	10	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Several characteristics make the search for novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes particularly promising.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	11	 First, and most importantly, the heritability of AD is high.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	12	 This has been demonstrated in various studies examining familial segregation of the disease over the past decades (1 to 3).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Accordingly, the probability of actually finding relevant disease-causing or predisposing genes is relatively high as well, possibly even more so than for other genetically complex neuropsychiatric disorders, like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or affective disorders (4).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Thus far, in AD this has been achieved for four genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, APOE), but only variation in the latter also plays a significant role in the most common late-onset form of the disorder (see below).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Fully penetrant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, on the other hand, lead to rare early-onset familial forms of AD via an increased generation of Ass42 and ss-amyloid deposition, a major neuropathological hallmark of the disease.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Secondly, there is direct evidence, based on simulation as well as empirical data, for the presence of additional AD risk genes besides APOE.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	17	 For instance, a recent simulation study predicted the existence of four to seven additional AD genes when searching for age of onset modifiers simulating a variety of different disease and inheritance models (3).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	18	 This number corresponds well with empirical data obtained in full genome searches, which overlap on 11 chromosomes, six of which show  significant  results in at least one study (Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Finally, the progressive neurodegeneration gradually leading to cognitive decline and dementia in AD patients exhibits distinct and well-established histopathological features upon post-mortem examination, allowing for the verification of  clinical  AD (5).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Currently, the accuracy of a clinical AD diagnosis is near or beyond 90% in academic centers (6 to 8).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This allows for a significant reduction of the number of phenocopies in study populations using published research criteria, and thereby increases the power of subsequent genetic or epidemiological analyses.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Overview of concordant linkage/association regions observed in full genome screens published until 2003   These disease-specific characteristics, together with the advent of relatively inexpensive and powerful high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the near completion of the human genome sequence have led to a steep increase in the number of laboratories studying the genetics of AD worldwide.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	23	 To date, no less than 12 full-genome screens using linkage- or association-based methodologies have been published for AD, some using overlapping or identical samples, but each employing different sets of genetic markers and/or analytic strategies (8 to 19) (Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	24	 On the other hand, the number of locus-specific, candidate gene-based AD association studies has now become nearly intractable.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Over the course of 2003, more than 10 genes were reported to show either positive or negative evidence of association with different AD phenotypes per month in peer-reviewed journals as listed on NCBI's  PubMed .
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Despite these vast efforts, no single gene has yet emerged to attain nearly the degree of replication and consistency that has been observed by literally hundreds of laboratories studying the association of APOE-4 and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In this review, we present and discuss the findings of all genetic AD association studies published in 2003 (excluding those explicitly searching for the causes of early-onset familial AD cases, i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Using these data as an example, we then attempt to pinpoint the methodological difficulties that are likely to underlie the remarkable failure to replicate genetic findings using current approaches.

0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	30	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   Genome screens As outlined above, the year 2003 has been almost unprecedented in terms of the number of studies attempting to unravel the causes of AD genetics.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Three full-genome screens (8,18,19), using both association and genetic linkage methods, have been added to the nine studies already reported in the literature for late-onset AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	32	 A study-by-study comparison using a P-value of 0.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	33	01 as cut-off reveals a total of 16 regions on 11 chromosomes that yield positive signals across at least two studies with markers no further than 25 Mb apart (Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Interestingly, all chromosomes with the strongest and most consistent signals, i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	35	 6, 9, 10, 12, 19 and 21, had already been implicated at least 3 years earlier, but received further support in 2003.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Based on these criteria the only  new  AD region to emerge in 2003 is on chromosome 2p23 to 24, at a position between 19 and 29 Mb.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Interestingly, this region was only implicated in studies using association methods and only in fairly isolated and homogeneous populations (i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	38	 the Finns and Wadi-Ara) (14,18).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Note that inclusion and exclusion criteria applied here are arbitrary and as such may overestimate the total number of positive signals.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	40	 They do, however, allow the comparison across a multitude of methodologically divergent approaches and should facilitate the interpretation of analyses based on actual candidate genes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	41	Candidate gene studies Searching  PubMed  (www.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	42	gov/PubMed/) with keywords  alzheimer* AND (association OR associated)  for all papers published between January 1 and December 31, 2003, retrieved a total of 1037 studies (on December 28, 2003), of which 90 directly deal with genetic association between candidate polymorphisms and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	43	 As can be seen in Table 2, these studies examined a total of 55 genetic loci ( locus  being a set of markers within the same 5 Mb genomic interval) on 20 different chromosomes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	44	 A total of 55 analyzed genes within these loci were found to be  positive  (as judged by the authors), while 68 tested  negative .
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Interestingly, even 10 years after its discovery, the largest number (n=18) of reports focusing on a single gene dealt with the association between APOE and AD, using new polymorphisms, new samples/ethnic groups or new phenotypes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	46	 When these studies were not considered, a total of 38 positive and 67 negative papers remained.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Overview of chromosomal loci tested for genetic association with AD in 2003   If 2003 represents one of the most prolific vintages for late-onset AD genetic studies, the next most pressing question is: did the large quantity of studies also dilute the quality of the product, perhaps even making for an unpalatable quaff? The answer, in our opinion, is yes, at least in the majority of cases.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	48	 There is growing consensus that the success rate and reliability of genetic association studies in complex diseases depend on the fulfillment of several criteria (20,21), three of which are discussed in more detail below.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	49	 These are in addition to the  classic  requirements of at least plausible biological and/or positional candidacy for any investigated locus, as well as direct proof of pathophysiological consequences of any positive disease association.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	50	 While the former criterion is fulfilled for the vast majority of AD candidate genes investigated thus far, the latter condition has been more elusive.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	51	 This is due to several factors that generally bedevil the study of genetic association in complex diseases, such as linkage disequilibrium with the actual (and functionally relevant) disease-modifying variant, small effect sizes (which impede the detection of significant effects using basic molecular and biochemical assays), and possibly the involvement of as yet unknown pathophysiological mechanisms.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The situation of APOE-4 in AD serves as a good example: while the genetic association per se has been extremely well established over the past decade, there is still no consensus as to how this association translates pathophysiologically (22,23).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	53	Thus, before attempting to uncover the  functional consequences  of any putative new disease association, we propose that more emphasis must be placed on criteria that allow for a better distinction between false-positive as well as false-negative findings prior to initial publication.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	54	Power: does the sample size and structure enable the investigators to detect effect sizes of only moderate or small extent? While this is an obvious concern in reports with a negative outcome, the power of a study also governs the rate of false positive findings, i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	55	 the probability that an observed significant association is indeed genuine and not only observed by chance (24 to 26).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Other factors influencing the ability to detect meaningful effects include the attributable risk of the polymorphism to the overall genetic variance, degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated allele and the actual disease predisposing variant, mode of inheritance and, to a lesser extent, disease prevalence.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	57	 While these variables are, of course, difficult to estimate when the true disease gene is unknown, power for any given sample size can fairly easily be calculated for a variety of possible and plausible scenarios.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In practice, however, this still remains the exception.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	59	 A recent study estimated that the minimal number of cases and controls sufficient to achieve 80% power at =0.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	60	05 is usually far greater than 200 when the actual disease allele is not tested directly, even under the most favorable of circumstances (26).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	61	 It is interesting that, regardless of these estimates, 20% of all studies published in 2003 have still used smaller sample sizes and thus are probably not suitable for use in reaching any reliable conclusion.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	62	Replicability: has the result been validated/replicated in an independent sample of sufficient size? While there have been reports of  significant  associations between putative candidate genes and AD on every chromosome in the human genome over the past 10 years (27), none of these findings with the exception of APOE-4 has yet been replicated consistently.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Many a seemingly  positive  result could (and should) have been validated in an independent dataset prior to its first publication, as several authors have long been suggesting in guidelines for the proper  quality control  of genetic association findings (20,21,25,28,29).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	64	 The current inflation of probable false-positive reports may have been avoided if independent replication had been sought earlier.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	65	 If an independent sample cannot be found in-house, the establishment of at least temporary  consortia  between collaborative laboratories to test each other's positive signals prior to publication would represent an easy and effective means to restore credibility.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Upon our review of the 2003 AD genetics literature, less than 20% of all studies either referred to findings in two or more independent samples at once, or were published in tandem with independent reports investigating the same candidate genes and/or genetic variants.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	67	Haplotype structure: have the authors made attempts to elucidate the structure of the underlying haplotype architecture? The more current and systematic assessment of haplotype structures at various regions throughout the genome in the past 3 to 4 years has emphasized the importance of performing haplotype- or systematic LD-analyses when searching for novel complex disease genes (30,31), especially when effect sizes are expected to be lower than those conferred by APOE-4.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In addition to increasing the power of the analyses, this approach also reduces the number of statistical tests that need to be performed, which should lead to a further decrease of false-positive findings.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Several very recently published complex disease associations would have been impossible to observe, without thorough assessment of the underlying haplotype architecture (32 to 34).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Along these lines, recent studies on APOE have shown that this locus would have been easily identified by means of haplotype analysis alone, even without the prior knowledge of the 4 polymorphism (35,36).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Yet, in 2003 only about one-third of all studies investigated more than one polymorphism per locus.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Only half of these carried out a more or less  thorough  assessment of haplotype structure (i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	73	 four or more polymorphisms per gene).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	74	Out of all 90 papers published in 2003 on the topic of genetic association between candidate genes and the different AD phenotypes, only 21 (23%) fulfilled at least two of the above criteria.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Most likely, many of the observed discrepancies across studies could be explained by a lack of methodological thoroughness.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Nonetheless, there were three loci, in addition to APOE, that tested positive across at least three studies (on chromosomes 6p21, 10q24, and 11q23; Table 2).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	77	 These loci are covered in the remainder of this review.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	78	Chromosome 6p21 This chromosomal region was implicated as harboring a putative AD gene as early as 1980, based on an association finding between variants in the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex region (HLA-A, at 30 Mb) and AD in a small case to control study (37).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	79	 Two other potential AD candidates map within this 5 Mb interval, the genes encoding the hereditary haemochromatosis protein (HFE, at 26 Mb) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA, at 31 Mb).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	80	 While in 2003 two studies reported significant evidence of association with the latter two genes (38,39), two other studies did not confirm these findings (40,41).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Another candidate gene located in this region, HAPA1B, has been found to be associated with certain neuropsychological variables (42), but not disease risk itself (43).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Finally, one study investigated variation in onset age as a function of the HLA A2-allele in a small sample of AD patients, but did not find any significant effects (44).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	83	 A literature search for association studies with any of these genes including the years before 2003 yielded at least 15 positive studies, while 10 reports found no evidence of a genetic involvement of these factors.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	84	 While there has been some evidence for a direct involvement of TNFA in Ass-production and toxicity (45), direct proof for a pathogenetic relevance for any of the other genes/proteins remains to be seen.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Furthermore, the full-genome screens for AD genes have consistently yielded signals on 6p21 residing between 39 and 42 Mb, whereas the associated genes map 10 Mb further proximal.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, while there is increasing evidence supporting the existence of a putative AD locus on 6p21 in general, the possibility that the actual disease gene has not yet been identified cannot be excluded, despite the overlapping positive results from this year and past studies.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	87	Chromosome 10q24 Of the six candidate loci analyzed in the region between 10q21 and 10q25 in 2003, three were reported to be associated with AD phenotypes across multiple samples (i.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	88	 CDC2/VR22, TNFRSF6/IDE and GSTO1/2).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	89	 The only locus found to be associated by more than one group of investigators is located between 90 and 94 Mb and encompasses the genes TNFRSF6 (90 Mb) and IDE/KIFF11/HHEX (46 to 48).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Probably the best candidate on biological grounds is IDE, encoding the insulin degrading enzyme (protein: IDE).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	91	 This metalloprotease has been shown to degrade monomeric Ass before it can aggregate into oligomeric forms and, ultimately, into ss-amyloid plaques (49).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	92	 While several issues of the proposed mode of action still remain controversial (e.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	93	 the precise cellular location of Ass cleavage, relevance of IDE function/dysfunction on the development of AD), there are now a number of animal models available showing the predicted effects in vivo (50 to 52).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Before 2003, there were two papers published showing allelic association with microsatellite markers in this region (53,54), while two reports did not find association with IDE variants or nearby markers and AD (55,56).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Note that the data on one of the negative studies (55) actually largely overlaps with the positive paper by Edland et al.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	96	 (46), with the important exception that the authors of the first paper did not account for potential interactions between IDE and APOE 4-status.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This may be crucial, since the latter study only found a significant effect of IDE on AD risk in individuals lacking the APOE 4-allele.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Clearly, more studies on independent samples of sufficient size are necessary to further elucidate the potential role of IDE variants on the development of AD in the more general population.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	99	In addition to the IDE locus, a total of four other genes on the long arm of chromosome 10 were found to be associated with AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Two of these (CDC2 and VR22) map 30 Mb proximal of IDE, while the other two (GSTO1/2 and PRSS11) map 10 to 30 Mb distal.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	101	 While none of these associations has yet been confirmed in independent AD samples, it is noteworthy that two of these genes were also found to be associated in other neurodegenerative illnesses, frontotemporal dementia (CDC2) (57) and Parkinson's disease (GSTO1/2) (58), potentially suggesting a more common pathway leading to neuronal cell death across these syndromes.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	102	 CDC2 encodes for the cell division cycle 2 protein which is involved in the phosphorylation of both tau and APP, and is found in neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	103	 GSTO1 and 2 encode for glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and -2, which are involved in the physiological response to oxidative stress, and may in particular be responsible for regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL1-ss.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Thus, while these are all plausible AD candidate genes on positional as well as biological/biochemical grounds, further studies are still necessary to elucidate their proposed roles in influencing the risk and/or age-at-onset for AD in the general population.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	105	Chromosome 11q23 The region near the tip of the long arm of chromosome 11 has been implicated in only one of the full genome screens published to date (8) (and therefore does not appear in Table 1).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Yet, there were a total of three studies showing significant association with an AD candidate gene in 2003: BACE, encoding the ss-site APP cleaving enzyme (ss-secretase) (59 to 61).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This protein is an excellent AD candidate on biochemical grounds as it is only after the ss-secretase cleavage of APP that Ass can be liberated from its precursor via -secretase cleavage.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Most interestingly and in contrast to all other putative AD associations discussed above there appears to be a high degree of consistency with respect to the site and allelic nature underlying these findings: all positive studies, including the initial report by Nowotny and colleagues published in 2001 (62), observe over-representations of the G-allele of a synonymous SNP located at codon 262 (in exon 5) in AD cases as compared with healthy controls.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	109	 Furthermore, in all of these studies the observed effect was most pronounced in carriers of the APOE 4-allele, yielding significantly elevated odds ratios ranging from 2 to 7.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	110	In contrast to these four positive associations, there is an equal number of studies in the literature showing no apparent effects of this BACE polymorphism and AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	111	 However, it must be pointed out that one of these only studied early-onset familial AD cases (63), and the remaining studies did not account for the potential interaction with the APOE 4-allele (64 to 66).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Unless this is done, similar to the situation encountered for the variants tested in IDE (see above), no firm conclusions can be reached as to whether or not the exon 5 polymorphism in BACE is a genetic risk factor for AD in these samples.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Thus, of the three known APP-cleaving enzymes and associated proteins [- (ADAM9,10 and 17), ss- (BACE, BACE2) and -secretase (PSEN1, APH1A, NCSTN, PEN2)], most of which have already been tested for genetic association with AD phenotypes, BACE currently shows the most promise of being a genuine and relevant risk factor for late-onset AD.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	114	 As is the case for all other putative AD genes, more studies using sufficiently sized samples and appropriate analytic strategies need to be performed before more general conclusions can be reached.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Note, that the first study examining the putative genetic role of BACE in late-onset AD in 2004 also reports a significant effect of the exon 5 polymorphism in a case-control sample of Chinese origin (67).
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	116	   CONCLUSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION 2003: A GOOD VINTAGE.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	117	 CONCLUSION REFERENCES   While the year 2003 has been extremely productive in terms of studies examining potential associations between candidate genes and AD phenotypes, the vast majority of results as in previous years remains controversial.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	118	 While in some cases this could be due to factors that are disease-specific (e.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	119	 larger than anticipated genetic heterogeneity and/or very small effect sizes of individual risk alleles), a good proportion of these controversies are probably caused by methodological issues.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	120	 Based on recent empirical and simulation data regarding the genetic make-up of complex diseases and the power of association studies in general, we propose that more attention should be paid to: (i) providing power estimates based on the structure of the analyzed sample for a variety of effect sizes and allele frequencies; (ii) replicating any positive signal in at least one independent population of sufficient size and power prior to initial publication; and (iii) thoroughly assessing the haplotype structure of any investigated locus, especially before reaching any negative conclusions.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	121	 Together with statistical techniques that take into account potential interactions with other genetic and non-genetic factors, and that allow for an adequate correction of multiple comparisons, adherence to these criteria should ensure the successful distinction between clinically relevant and irrelevant/false-positive findings.
0.43645546.14764623.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Eventually, as in a good vintage of wine, this strategy will elevate the quality of AD genetics research to be on par with its quantity.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Of 6,434 eligible subjects aged 65 years or older in 1991, 4,615 were alive in 1996 and participated in the follow-up study.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	10	 All participants were cognitively normal in 1991 when they completed a risk factor questionnaire.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Their cognitive status was reassessed 5 years later by using a similar two-phase procedure, including a screening interview, followed by a clinical examination when indicated.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The analysis included 194 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,894 cognitively normal controls.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Increasing age, fewer years of education, and the apolipoprotein E 4 allele were significantly associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, wine consumption, coffee consumption, and regular physical activity were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	15	 No statistically significant association was found for family history of dementia, sex, history of depression, estrogen replacement therapy, head trauma, antiperspirant or antacid use, smoking, high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The protective associations warrant further study.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In particular, regular physical activity could be an important component of a preventive strategy against Alzheimer s disease and many other conditions.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	20	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Dementia is a growing problem in aging populations.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Its impact on health services and society is of increasing concern to health policy makers and service providers as life expectancy increases and, more particularly, as the baby-boom generation ages.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Among Canadians aged 65 years or older, Alzheimer s disease accounts for almost two thirds of prevalent cases of dementia (1).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The majority of epidemiologic studies of risk factors for Alzheimer s disease to date have been retrospective case-control studies that compared prevalent Alzheimer s disease cases with nondemented controls (2).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Retrospective studies are subject to methodological problems including survival bias and recall bias.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	25	 In addition, collecting very detailed exposure information is difficult because the information must be obtained from proxies (3).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Some risk or protective factors for Alzheimer s disease suggested in prevalence studies, such as family history of dementia, have not been upheld in prospective studies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	27	Even though investigations using prospective designs should reveal a more defined picture of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease, results obtained so far are not consistent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The European Community Concerted Action on Epidemiology and Prevention of Dementia (EURODEM) group associated smoking with a higher risk of Alzheimer s disease (3), whereas other studies did not observe any significant relation between smoking and the onset of Alzheimer s disease (4 to 6).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The EURODEM group also found that female sex and low educational level were associated with increased risks of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Conversely, sex and education were not reported as risk factors for incident Alzheimer s disease in other studies (7, 8).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Methodological differences, such as duration of follow-up, and selection and number of study participants may account for these discrepancies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	32	The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) is a large, national, multicenter, longitudinal study of dementia in elderly people focusing on its prevalence (1), incidence (9), and risk factors (10 to 12).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	33	 As part of the first phase (CSHA-1), a case-control study was conducted.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Age, family history of dementia, educational level, arthritis, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly related to Alzheimer s disease (10).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We report here the results of a prospective analysis of risk factors for incident cases of late-onset Alzheimer s disease, which were based on risk factor data collected at CSHA-1 from those who were cognitively normal and on diagnosis of incident Alzheimer s disease 5 years later at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	36	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The study methods have been described in detail elsewhere (1, 9) and are summarized here.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Eighteen field centers across Canada participated in this national study, which was coordinated jointly by the University of Ottawa and Health Canada.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	38	Initial assessment (CSHA-1) In 1991 to 1992, representative samples of men and women aged 65 years or older were drawn from 36 urban and surrounding rural areas; all 10 Canadian provinces were covered.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Of the 10,263 participants, 9,008 lived in the community while 1,255 resided in institutions and were excluded from this analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Those in the community were interviewed about their health, presence of specific disorders, and limitations in performing basic and instrumental activities of daily living based on the Older Americans Resources and Services Activities of Daily Living scale (13).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	41	 All participants were screened for dementia by using the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination (14, 15).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Those who screened positive (a 3MS Examination score of below 78/100) and a random sample of those who screened negative (a score of 78 or above) were invited to participate in an extensive clinical evaluation, which followed a three-stage protocol.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	43	 A nurse first readministered the 3MS Examination and collected information on the participant s medical and family history.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Next, a physician conducted a standardized physical and neurologic examination.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Finally, for those participants deemed testable (a 3MS Examination score of 50 or above), a psychometrist administered a series of neuropsychological tests (16), which were interpreted later by a neuropsychologist.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	46	Independent preliminary diagnoses were made by the physician and neuropsychologist, which was followed by a case conference in which a consensus diagnosis was reached according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, criteria for dementia (17); the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer s disease (18); and other specific criteria for cognitive impairment (19) and vascular dementia (20).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Diagnoses comprised the following categories: no cognitive impairment; cognitive impairment, no dementia; probable and possible Alzheimer s disease; vascular dementia; other specific dementia; and unclassifiable dementia.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	48	Detailed information about risk factors was gathered from a self-administered questionnaire completed at CSHA-1 by those participants found to be cognitively normal on the basis of either the screening test or clinical examination.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	49	 The risk factor questionnaire covered sociodemographic characteristics, occupational and environmental exposures, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, intake of selected food items, and regular exercise), and family and medical history (prior head injury with and without loss of consciousness, chronic diseases, and medication use).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Participants were asked whether they engaged in regular exercise (yes/no), but "regular" was not explicitly defined.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Regular consumption of beer, wine, and spirits was defined as at least once a week.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Regular consumption of tea and coffee was defined as nearly every day.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	53	Follow-up study (CSHA-2) In 1996 to 1997, all subjects who could be contacted and who agreed to participate in the second wave of the study were interviewed to measure changes in their health status and functioning an average of 5 years after CSHA-1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Participants took part in the same diagnostic process as the one used at CSHA-1, including the screening test, the nurse evaluation, and the clinical evaluation.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Two diagnoses of dementia were made at a consensus conference, one according to the same criteria used at CSHA-1 and the other according to the more recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria (21) for Alzheimer s disease and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for vascular dementia (22).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	56	 The more recent criteria were used to define cases for the current analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Blood samples were collected, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele status was determined in a subsample of subjects examined clinically (23).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	58	For participants who died before the follow-up study was conducted, the date and cause of death were obtained from the relevant provincial Registrar of Vital Statistics, and a relative or other informant was interviewed to assess the subject s physical and cognitive status 3 months prior to death.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	59	 For subjects who died during follow-up, the probability of dementia was estimated from three different sources (9): 1) mention of dementia on death certificates; 2) information from proxies about a diagnosis of memory problems, Alzheimer s disease, or senile dementia prior to death; and 3) a logistic regression model, based on an analysis of 71 people who died within 2 to 5 months of a complete diagnostic evaluation, estimating the probability that the deceased person was demented prior to death.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These estimates were available for 1,022 decedents (87.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Because this procedure did not permit diagnosis of the type of dementia, decedents were omitted from the main analysis.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	62	 A secondary analysis was then conducted to assess the potential impact of omitting decedents; all deaths classified as due to dementia were included as Alzheimer s disease cases, and deaths not due to dementia were considered controls.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	63	Both phases of the CSHA were approved by the ethics review committees in all 18 participating study centers as well as at the coordinating center.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Participants or their proxies provided informed consent for each component of the study.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	65	 However, residents of the province of Newfoundland had to be omitted from the prospective analysis because a 1996 legal interpretation of the province s advance directives legislation prohibited the use of proxy consent for persons unable to give full, informed consent to participate in research studies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This interpretation meant that people with dementia could not provide consent for the clinical examination (i.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	67	, the outcome measure could not be obtained).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Therefore, all Newfoundland participants were excluded.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	69	Analysis This analysis included only those participants living in the community as of CSHA-1.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	70	 A case-control analysis was conducted, with incident cases and controls selected at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	71	 To be included, participants  initial screening results had to be negative or, at CSHA-1, participants had to be clinically diagnosed without 1) cognitive impairment, no dementia or 2) dementia.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Cases were diagnosed with probable or possible Alzheimer s disease at CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Comparisons were made with controls who, at CSHA-2, remained without cognitive impairment, no dementia or dementia according to the clinical evaluation or screening test at follow-up.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	74	Differences between cases and controls regarding means and proportions were compared by using the t test and the chi-square test, respectively.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios for the various risk factors.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Under the rare disease assumption, the odds ratio can be considered a valid estimate of the relative risk.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Of the antecedent or coexisting chronic conditions included in the risk factor questionnaire, only arthritis was significantly related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	105	 No statistically significant relation was observed between Alzheimer s disease risk and high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, depression, head trauma, diabetes, thyroid condition, cancer (any type), or stomach ulcer.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Use of NSAIDs reduced the risk of Alzheimer s disease by 35 percent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	107	 This effect was due mostly to nonsalicylates.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Inclusion of both NSAID use and arthritis along with age, sex, and education in the same model yielded similar odds ratio estimates; both factors remained protective for Alzheimer s disease, while testing of the interaction between NSAIDs and arthritis was not significant (p = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	109	 No association of Alzheimer s disease with antihypertensive agents, antacids, corticosteroids, or estrogen therapy was found.

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Regular alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease; more particularly, wine consumption reduced the risk by 50 percent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Other variables observed to be significantly associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer s disease were daily coffee consumption and regular physical activity (31 percent reductions for both).

0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The prospective nature of this analysis, high response rates, careful standardization of screening and clinical assessments, and thorough checking of questionnaires as well as coding and editing of the data constitute further strengths of the study.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	123	We found that increasing age, low educational level, and the APOE4 allele were associated with increased risks of incident Alzheimer s disease, while arthritis, regular use of NSAIDs, wine consumption, coffee consumption, and regular physical activity were associated with reduced risks.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	124	 Of note, family history of dementia and smoking were not related to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	125	 In addition, estrogen was not shown to be protective.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	126	However, our results are subject to potential limitations.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	127	 First, of all eligible community subjects at baseline for whom a risk factor questionnaire was available, 1,172 (18.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	128	2 percent) died during the 5-year follow-up period and were not included in the main analyses.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	129	 This group of decedents included proportionately more men, was generally older, was less educated, and suffered more frequently from chronic diseases than did subjects who completed follow-up.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Exclusion of these participants may have distorted the results if, for example, these subjects were both more frequently exposed to a particular risk factor and at higher risk of developing Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	131	 Results from the simulation that included those subjects who died suggest that, although arthritis, NSAID use, wine consumption, and coffee consumption might be potentially valid protective factors for Alzheimer s disease, some bias due to exclusion of decedents during follow-up might also partially explain these associations.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	132	Another limitation of our analysis is the possibility of bias in assessing risk factor exposures.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	133	 In spite of the prospective nature of the study, our results could be explained, at least in part, by some preclinical cognitive decline (not yet detectable by screening and clinical evaluations at CSHA-1) among subjects who had developed Alzheimer s disease by CSHA-2.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Although it cannot be ruled out, this explanation seems improbable in view of the extensive screening and clinical evaluation process that was used at CSHA-1 to diagnose cognitive impairment, no dementia as well as dementia, along with the relatively long follow-up period.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	135	 Nevertheless, to test this possibility, results were reanalyzed by excluding cases whose symptoms of Alzheimer s disease were reported by their proxies to have started within 2 years after CSHA-1 (up to the end of 1993).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The persistence of a protective effect on Alzheimer s disease of NSAIDs (odds ratio (OR) = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	137	99), and physical activity (OR = 0.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	138	94) does not support the hypothesis that a preclinical decline explains our results.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	139	Since multiple comparisons were performed, it is possible that some statistically significant associations may have occurred because of chance.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	140	 For new associations that were found, for example, the protective effect of coffee drinking, replication in other studies will be needed to determine the validity of the association.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Our results are generalizable to populations of largely European descent.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	142	 Inclusion of different ethnic groups living in Canada was determined by their ability to speak either English or French.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	143	Family history of dementia, similar to advancing age and the APOE4 allele, frequently has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease and is generally considered a definite risk factor (24).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The CSHA-1 case-control study found an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease that increased significantly by two- to threefold for family history of dementia (10).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, as in the EURODEM pooled data set (3), the prospective analysis of CSHA data did not find this association.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These contradictory findings might reflect misclassification of the information because of recall bias and/or the uncertainty of information collected with the help of informants in retrospective investigations compared with longitudinal studies.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	147	 In a case-control study, Mayeux et al.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	148	 (25) observed that relatives of patients whose onset of Alzheimer s disease began at age 70 years or older did not have an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease, whereas there was an increased risk for first-degree relatives of patients whose onset occurred prior to age 70 years.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Thus, it would seem reasonable that we did not observe this association in our older cohort.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	150	 It may be surprising that family history of dementia was not associated with Alzheimer s disease while an increased risk of Alzheimer s disease was observed for subjects who had the APOE4 allele, since family history of dementia is believed to be a potential indicator of this genetic factor.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, it has been suggested that the APOE4 allele does not explain a large part of family history of dementia (26).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	152	 In this study, 13 percent of those who had at least one APOE4 allele reported a parent with dementia compared with 10 percent of those who had no 4 allele.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	153	The association between low educational level and the risk of Alzheimer s disease is consistent with findings from several retrospective and prospective studies (3, 10, 27 to 29).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	154	 As in other large-scale population-based studies, CSHA cases were ascertained by means of a two-phase diagnostic procedure (screening and clinical examination).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The cutpoint for screening with the 3MS Examination was chosen to achieve high sensitivity, even though this cutpoint could have missed mild cases of Alzheimer s disease in people with higher levels of education who could still perform well on cognitive screening tests.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Whether the risk of Alzheimer s disease associated with less education corresponds to an artifact or represents a true risk factor is still unclear.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Explanations for the education effect include increased brain reserve (30), selection bias resulting from selective attrition or use of a two-phase diagnostic procedure (27, 31), and confounding by indicators of socioeconomic status linked to education, such as diet, lifestyle, and occupational history (32, 33).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	158	The present analysis supports the hypothesis of a negative association between NSAIDs and the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	159	 This protective relation was also found in several population-based case-control studies, including the CSHA-1 analysis (34).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	160	 At least one longitudinal study supports the protective effect of anti-inflammatory drugs against Alzheimer s disease and dementia (35), while some studies remain inconclusive (36, 37).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	161	Regular wine consumption was also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Results from the PAQUID Study, a longitudinal study of community residents, showed a similar negative relation between wine consumption and Alzheimer s disease (38).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This protective effect remained significant after more in-depth statistical analyses were conducted (39).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It has been suggested that specific substances in wine, but not in other alcoholic beverages, could be responsible for this positive effect on nerve cells in dementia (40).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	165	In our analysis, regular consumption of coffee seemed to be protective for Alzheimer s disease.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Low coffee intake was reported to be related to mental disability after a 25-year follow-up of 716 Finnish men (41).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Without confirmation from other prospective studies of Alzheimer s disease, this finding may have been due to chance.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	168	The potential protective effect of regular physical activity on the risk of Alzheimer s disease is important because it represents a modifiable lifestyle habit.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the possible protective role of regular physical activity on the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly, and results have been inconsistent (7, 42).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, in clinical trials, exercise has been shown to benefit cognitive function (43, 44).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	171	 More recently, regular physical activity has been found to be protective against cognitive impairment as well as all types of dementia, including Alzheimer s disease, and an interaction with sex has been reported, suggesting greater protection in women than in men (45).
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	172	In conclusion, this large-scale prospective study of older-age onset of Alzheimer s disease confirmed some of the most frequently suggested etiologic hypotheses about the disease, but not all.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Intriguing protective associations observed in our study warrant further research.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Few preventive strategies for Alzheimer s disease have been explored.
0.2731872.12196314.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Regular physical activity could represent a novel and safe preventive strategy against Alzheimer s disease and many other conditions, and it should be examined further.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	19	 PLAU_1 is a plausible pathogenic mutation that could act by increasing Ass42, but additional biological experiments are required to show this definitively.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	20	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   In previous studies, we and others showed that plasma amyloid ss protein (Ass42) (1) and late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (2) are linked to a locus at 81 cM on chromosome 10.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Together these two independent studies provide strong evidence for a novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene at this locus that acts on Ass42.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	22	 The urokinase-type plasminogen activator gene (PLAU) is located on chromosome 10q21 to 22 at 95 cM within the 1 to LOD support interval of the linkage peak at 81 cM.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Urokinase-type plasminogen activator is a serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin (3).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	24	 PLAU expression is induced by Ass aggregates, and plasmin degrades both aggregated and non-aggregated Ass in vitro in a possible negative feedback loop.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Thus, PLAU could have an important role in controlling Ass aggregation, which is widely believed to play an important role in AD pathogenesis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Ass is the major proteinaceous component of senile plaques, one of the main pathologic hallmarks of AD (4).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Ass composed of 42(43) amino acids (Ass42) is present in all senile plaques, and Ass40 is also found in most cases (5).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Ass42 was shown to be elevated in serum, brain and cell culture studies performed in patients and animal models of familial AD due to known autosomal dominant mutations (6 to 12).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Some of these studies have also shown elevations in Ass40, though not as consistently and to the same degree as Ass42.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Thus, it is postulated that although both Ass42 and Ass40 associate with one of the pathogenic hallmarks of AD, owing to its consistent and more prominent presence along with the biochemical properties of greater fibrillogenicity and aggregation potential, Ass42 is a more pathogenic biomarker of AD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	31	Given its genomic location and potential functional relevance to AD, we tested PLAU as a candidate gene for LOAD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	32	 PLAU is a relatively small, 5970 bp gene found on the NT_008583 chromosome 10 contig and also defined by the AF377330 sequence (www.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	36	 After establishing significant association between PLAU variants and two AD phenotypes, plasma Ass42 levels and AD-affected status, we focus on a single missense mutation in a larger data set of 24 LOAD families and six case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	37	The missense mutation is a variant in exon 6 (rs2227564=PLAU_1) that causes a proline to leucine change (P141L) within the kringle domain of PLAU at the junction between two ss-pleated sheets (13,14).

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	46	 An additional SNP in exon 2 was identified using the public SNP databases.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The seven PLAU SNPs, their locations and NCBI SNP names are summarized in Table 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	48	8 kb in the PLAU gene, were analyzed in the 10 LOAD families used to link plasma Ass42 to chromosome 10 (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	49	 In addition, they were genotyped in three independent case to control series collected at Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR), Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ) and University of Kentucky (UKy).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	50	 The SNP allele frequencies, deviations from Hardy to Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and allelic association results are summarized in Table 2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Given that the two exon 11 SNPs are in complete LD, the results for only one of these exon 11 SNPs are summarized in Table 2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	52	 In summary, the rare exon 2 SNP showed Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the MCJ and MCR series in both the case and the control groups.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Apart from this, there was only one instance where an SNP deviated significantly from the HWE in the control group (exon 6 SNP=PLAU_1 in MCJ controls).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	54	 PLAU SNP frequencies   From the PLAU SNP genotypes of the family members, PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified using the haplotyping algorithm within the computer program Simwalk2 (17,18).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Three major PLAU SNP haplotypes were identified, as were three minor haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Collectively, the six PLAU SNP haplotypes accounted for  > 95% of all of the haplotypes in these families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The frequency of each PLAU SNP haplotype in the 10 AD families is summarized in Table 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Because there was profound LD (D' > 0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	59	4 for all SNPs except exon 8 SNP), only five of the seven SNPs were required to construct all six haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	60	Table 3 summarizes the LD parameters, Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient (19) D' and d2, estimated from the founders in the 10 extended LOAD families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The profound LD between the SNPs can easily be appreciated in this table.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Exon 11 deletion mutant was in complete LD with the other exon 11 SNP.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Exon 2 SNP was too rare to yield meaningful results.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Thus, these two SNPs were omitted from the LD analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	65	 LD was also estimated in the MCR, MCJ and UKy series within the cases and controls and yielded similar results.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	66	 As each individual carries two haplotypes, we termed the genotype formed by these two haplotypes as  compound genotypes .
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	67	 As described subsequently, each compound genotype essentially unambiguously defines a haplotype pair due to profound LD between PLAU SNPs and limited haplotype diversity.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	68	 We next tested for association between plasma Ass42 levels and PLAU haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	69	 PLAU SNPs LD   Association of PLAU variants with plasma Ass42 levels in 10 LOAD families To test for association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU variants in family members, we used the variance components methodology implemented in the computer program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Using the within-pedigree identity-by-state model of Hopper and Mathews (21), PLAU SNP haplotypes were initially analyzed in family members between the ages of 20 and 65 years because this was the age group in which plasma Ass42 was linked to the chromosome 10 locus (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	71	 In this age group, there was no significant association between PLAU variants and plasma Ass42 levels (Table 4).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Inspection of our data suggested that there might be an association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 in older family members, so we performed a second analysis using family members of all ages.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Remarkably, this group showed significant association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass42 (P=0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Association of PLAU SNP haplotypes with plasma Ass42 in 10 LOAD families   Association of PLAU variants with AD in three case to control series Our working hypothesis is that any gene with variants influencing Ass42 is likely to have variants influencing risk for AD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	76	 To determine whether PLAU has variants that are associated with AD in case to control series, we analyzed the PLAU SNPs in three independent series obtained at MCR, MCJ and UKy.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	77	 All three series were entirely composed of Caucasian subjects, and in every AD patient the age of onset was 59 years.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Using the computer program GOLD (22) to analyze the PLAU SNPs, we determined that there is profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs in the case to control series similar to the LOAD family founders (data not shown).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	79	An important consequence of the profound LD among the five PLAU SNPs that we analyzed was that there were relatively few common genotypes such that 96 to 100% of the subjects were accounted for by only 12 compound genotypes (Table 5).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	80	 In Table 5, the two haplotypes producing six of the 12 compound genotypes (A, D, F, I, J and K) were unambiguous, because no more than one SNP was heterozygous.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Each of the remaining six genotypes is produced by one and only one pair of the six haplotypes identified in the LOAD families (Table 1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	82	 The only other pairs that could produce these categories would include at least one haplotype that is so rare it was never identified unambiguously in the case to control series or by Simwalk2 haplotype analysis of the LOAD families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	83	 As these combinations will be rare, the PLAU SNP haplotypes in 96 to 100% of the subjects in our LOAD case to control series were easily identified and essentially unambiguous (Table 5).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	84	 Association of PLAU compound genotypes with AD in three case to control series   To evaluate association between AD and the compound genotypes summarized in Table 5, we performed 2-tests on each series using the Monte Carlo approach (T1) implemented in CLUMP to determine significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In each of the three series examined, these genotypes showed significant association with AD (MCR, P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Some compound genotypes tended to have the same trends in two or more series analyzed (e.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	87	 2/2, 1/4 and 3/5), suggesting the presence of functional variants on the backbones of these genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	88	After we found the association between PLAU  compound genotypes  and three case to control series, MCR, MCJ and UKy, we tested for association between the missense PLAU_1 SNP and the larger data set of six case to control series, the results of which are depicted subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Finally, we went back to test for association between PLAU compound genotypes and the three additional case to control series (Gothenburg, Gothenburg-Postmortem, Scottish) and did not find significant association in these series (data not shown).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	90	Association of PLAU_1 SNP (rs2227564) with plasma Ass42 levels in 24 LOAD families Of the PLAU variants analyzed, rs2227564, which we internally termed PLAU_1, is a relatively common missense SNP, which leads to a proline to leucine change in the kringle domain of PLAU at the junction between two ss-pleated sheets (13,14) and has been shown to have a functional effect on the fibrin binding of PLAU zymogen (14).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	91	 To determine whether PLAU_1 genotypes are associated with plasma Ass42, we analyzed a larger set of 24 extended LOAD families, which includes the original group of 10 families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	92	 To take family relationships into account, these analyses were performed using variance components methodology implemented in the program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	93	In the members of these 24 families, the change that occurs in plasma Ass42 with aging is complex.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Plasma Ass42, which is elevated in young subjects, first decreases and then increases again with age  > 50.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	95	 This is shown in Figure 1, where plasma Ass42 stratified by PLAU_1 genotype is plotted as a function of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Non-linear analysis, in which we analyzed age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype (CC, CT, TT or CT+TT) and the interactions among age, age(2) and PLAU_1 genotype in the variance components framework, showed a significant age-dependent association between plasma Ass42 and PLAU_1 CT and TT genotypes (CTxage, TTxage(2), CT+TTxage(2) and age(2) were all significant at P < 0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	97	 As our main concern was to determine whether there is a significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Ass42 in elderly subjects associated with the CT, TT or pooled CT+TT genotypes, we performed a second analysis in which family members  > 50 years (Fig.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	98	 2) were analyzed using linear regression in the variance components framework.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	99	 This analysis showed that the CTxage and TTxage covariates had significant effects (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	100	007, respectively) in the 24 LOAD families (Table 7).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	101	 When the CT and TT variables were tested as a single CT+TT variable, the CT+TTxage covariate was even more significant (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	102	 It is noteworthy that even when we correct for the fact that three age groups were tested prior to the analysis of the 50 age group summarized in Table 7, using the most conservative approach of Bonferroni correction, there is still highly significant age-related PLAU genotype effect in these families (overall corrected P-values are 0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	109	 We subsequently went back to analyze the haplotypes in the 24 families in this age group, which accounted for 22% of the total variance in the plasma Ass42 phenotype and was also significant (P=0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	124	  Analysis of Ass in PLAU knockout mice Our finding that PLAU variants are associated with elevated plasma Ass42 predicts that plasma Ass42 should be elevated in KO mice lacking a functional PLAU gene.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	125	 To test this, we analyzed plasma Ass42 in 11 PLAU KO mice (16) and 14 control mice with the same genetic background.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	126	 For comparison, KO mice lacking a functional neprilysin gene, which is known to be involved in Ass degradation (24), were analyzed in parallel.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	127	 When compared with controls, 3 to 6-month-old PLAU KO mice showed a highly significant increase in plasma Ass42 (P=0.

0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	150	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Identification of an LOAD risk locus on chromosome 10 (2), which also affects plasma Ass (1) levels in extended LOAD families, has led to the search for genes that are good functional candidates in this region.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	151	 PLAU is both a good functional and a good positional candidate gene that converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades Ass.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	152	 We genotyped seven SNPs within this relatively small gene spanning almost its entire length.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	153	 We found that these SNPs were in profound LD with each other leading to limited haplotype diversity in the region analyzed, a finding consistent with previous work (25 to 27).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	154	 The limited haplotype diversity allowed us to perform association analysis using the compound genotypes that make up the haplotype pair for each subject.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	155	 The advantage of this approach is that it does not require phase information as each compound genotype forms a group per se.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Nonetheless, given the small number of compound genotypes observed in all series, one can identify the underlying haplotype pair for  > 95% of all subjects essentially unambiguously.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	157	 The other advantage of the compound genotype approach is that it allows for the analysis of the  haplotype pair  rather than individual haplotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Thus, variants that are effective in an additive fashion, but not when encountered alone, will be easier to identify using this approach.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	159	 We determined significant association between the PLAU compound genotypes with AD in three independent case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	160	We then analyzed a common missense SNP, PLAU_1 (rs2227564) in a larger set of 24 families and six case to control series that include the initial series analyzed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	161	 In the extended families, this SNP was associated with an age-related elevation in plasma Ass levels in individuals  > 50 years of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Plasma Ass displays a complex characteristic in that it appears to decline in an age-related fashion until 50 years of age and increase thereafter.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This characteristic is much more pronounced in subjects who have the CT or TT genotype for PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It is also noteworthy that the significance of association with PLAU haplotypes is enhanced when the  > 50 age group is analyzed separately in the 10 families, as expected (Table 4).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	165	 The finding of age-related increase in Ass is also evident in the plasma Ass of PLAU KO mice, consistent with the finding in humans.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	166	 These mice have significantly higher plasma Ass levels when compared with wild-type littermates; however, their brain Ass levels did not show significant difference.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	167	 This finding could have several explanations.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	168	 This may suggest that PLAU variants influence AD through an effect on plasma but not brain Ass42.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	169	 While this is conceivable, it is more likely that PLAU influences both plasma and brain Ass in a way that is not evident in KO mice.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Thus, PLAU may have a greater influence on secreted than on cell-associated Ass.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	171	 As most brain Ass is cell-associated (28), effects on secreted Ass that are easily detected in plasma could be hard to detect in brain.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Alternatively, compensatory changes triggered by PLAU KO may maintain brain Ass more effectively than plasma Ass.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	173	We analyzed PLAU_1 in six case to control series using meta-analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	174	 (29) reported their meta-analyses of published genetic associations with various disease phenotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Of the 25 reported associations that they investigated by meta-analysis, eight showed significant association that replicated the original study, with most ORs in the 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	176	 On the basis of these findings, the authors recommended that large, collaborative genetic association studies should be encouraged, that all sound studies, positive or negative, should be published and that reports of association should include a meta-analysis of all available data.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Our meta-analyses of the PLAU_1 SNP in six case to control series indicate that the PLAU_1 CT+TT is associated with a modest (OR=1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	178	21), but marginally significant (P=0.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	179	 This result is similar to that of Lohmueller et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	180	 (29), whose meta-analyses identified many other common genetic variants with modest, but significant effects on other disease phenotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Two other groups had previously published their findings on this SNP (15,30).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	182	 (15) found significant association in three case to control series from Germany, Switzerland and Italy, whereas Myers et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	183	 (30) did not find evidence of association with any of the PLAU SNPs they analyzed including PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Interestingly, the former found that in their series, it is the CC genotype that is associated with increased risk for LOAD, whereas in our series, it is the CT and TT genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Furthermore, another group from Germany also found significant association with the CT and TT genotypes (M.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Riemenschneider, personal communication).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Thus, there clearly is heterogeneity among all these findings, with one group having significant results in the same direction as our series (M.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Riemenschneider), another finding significance with the common genotype (15) and a third group not finding any significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Clearly, all results need to be analyzed in one meta-analysis subsequent to their publication.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Nonetheless, as demonstrated by Lohmueller et al.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	191	 (29), such discrepancies are frequent among studies of common genetic variants in complex diseases, particularly when the effect size is modest.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	192	 There are many reasons for such discrepancies including small sample size, gene to gene and gene to environment interactions not modelled in studies, intra-sample heterogeneity/population substructure and analysis of the  marker  variant instead of the  disease  variant with varying degrees of LD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	193	 While we tried to minimize these factors by gathering large series, age matching the Mayo Clinic series and choosing a variant that is likely to be functional itself, it is still plausible that some of these problems may be contributing to inter-series variations observed for PLAU_1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	194	Indeed, the association for PLAU_1 is marginally significant with the confidence interval of 1.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Nonetheless, this statistical result should be considered in the presence of evidence from the family and animal data on the effect of PLAU in Ass; and with the understanding that there likely exist other variants in PLAU that affect the risk of AD, as suggested by the  compound genotype  data in the case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Furthermore, given the likely presence of important variants in other genes, such as VR22 and IDE, the finding of highly significant P-values for variants of modest effect in complex diseases may need to await the identification of most, if not all, functional mutations in multiple genes and their analyses in multiple large series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	197	We recently published our findings of significant association in two other genes on chromosome 10 (31,32), IDE and VR22.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	198	 When we tested the key variants in all three genes, we did not find evidence of LD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Joint analysis of the key variants demonstrates separate, independent effects.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Of all of the variants, only those in VR22 account for the linkage on chromosome 10.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	201	 PLAU variants are different from the other two in their age-related effects that manifest themselves more strongly after age 50.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	202	 Thus, each of these genes appears to act independently of one another via apparent separate mechanisms.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	203	 While the unequivocal effects of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD await the identification of all of the functional variants and testing them in large series, these findings provide evidence for the existence of LOAD risk variants that affect Ass, within and/or in the vicinity of these genes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	204	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Subjects We initially collected 10 extended LOAD families.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Four of these families were collected via an LOAD patient who had extremely high plasma Ass42 and/or Ass40 levels ( extremes , top 10th percentile of the 545 AD patients in our series).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	206	 The remaining six families were ascertained via a LOAD proband who had multiple relatives with LOAD, without prior Ass measurements ( non-extremes ).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	207	 One of the probands from the  non-extreme  families was determined to have extremely high-plasma Ass levels after the family collection; therefore, this family was grouped with the  extreme families  subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	208	 The detailed collection strategies and family profiles for these families are provided elsewhere (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	209	 In addition to these 10 families, 14 independent extended LOAD pedigrees were subsequently collected.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These additional pedigrees were collected via a proband who was a first-degree relative of a LOAD patient.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	211	 All except one of these probands for the 14 additional pedigrees had elevated plasma Ass levels.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	212	 The LOAD families studied in this article lacked a clear autosomal dominant mode of segregation for AD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	213	In addition to the extended LOAD families, six different case to control series were analyzed in this study.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	214	 These series are named as follows: Mayo Clinic Rochester (MCR), Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ), University of Kentucky (UKy), Gothenburg, Gothenburg-Postmortem and Scottish.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	215	 MCR samples were collected as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's disease patient registry, a community-based prospective registry and the Mayo Clinic Rochester memory disorders clinic case to control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	216	 MCJ samples were collected at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville memory disorders clinic.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	217	 UKy series were collected as part of the University of Kentucky memory disorders clinic and BRAINS program.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	218	 MCR, MCJ and UKy series consisted of Caucasian subjects from the United States.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	219	 The Gothenburg and Gothenburg-Postmortem series consisted of Swedish AD cases recruited from a prospective longitudinal study of patients with dementia (The Molndal prospective dementia study).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	220	 Swedish controls consisted of healthy volunteers (Gothenburg) and autopsy cases (Gothenburg-Postmortem).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Finally, the Scottish samples were composed of EOAD patients from the Lothian Psychiatric case register, and Scottish controls consisting of local church congregation volunteers from the Lothian region.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	222	 The EOAD materials were selected from non-familial cases, and the most common presenilin-I mutations have been screened for.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	223	 The few positives found were discarded from the test set.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	224	Clinical AD diagnoses in all series were made according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (33).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	225	 All neuropathologically diagnosed AD patients (Gothenburg-Postmortem) also fulfilled the clinical NINCDS criteria for probable AD and met the neuropathological CERAD criteria for definitive AD.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	226	 The ADs in all series except the Scottish series had ages of onset 59 years.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	227	This study was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and appropriate informed consent was obtained from all participants.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	228	Identification and genotyping of PLAU SNPs Eleven members were selected from the 10 extended LOAD families that gave the linkage signal on chromosome 10 (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The genomic DNA from five family members and two probands with high-plasma Ass level and from two members and two married-in spouses with low levels were sequenced.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	230	 The samples came from four different families, three of which had probands with  extreme high  Ass levels.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Intronic primers flanking the PLAU exons were used for PCR amplification.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	232	 All of the coding regions, 400 bp of the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and 1000 bp of the 3'-UTR of PLAU were sequenced.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	233	 The sequencing was done via a semi-automated fluorescent method using an ABI377 sequencer and associated Factura software packages.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The SNP databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; URL: http://www.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	235	gov/SNP/) and University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (UW-FHCRC; URL: http://pga.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	236	edu) were also screened for SNP identification.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	237	 The SNPs identified via the sequencing effort were used in the analysis as well as a rare missense SNP in exon 2 identified in the bioinformatics screen.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	238	 When the seven SNPs, thus identified, were analyzed in haplotype analysis, it was determined that two of them, the missense exon 2 SNP and exon 11 deletion SNP yielded redundant information.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Therefore, remainder of the analysis was carried out with five SNPs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	240	PLAU SNP frequencies estimated in MCJ, MCR, UKy series and 24 LOAD families are summarized in Table 2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Of all the SNPs tested in all these groups, the rare Exon 2 SNP is in Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the control groups in MCJ and MCR.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	242	 This SNP is not used in the compound genotype analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	243	 In addition, exon 6 SNP is in Hardy to Weinberg disequilibrium in the MCJ control series.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	244	DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using routine methods.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	245	 The Gothenburg, Gothenburg-Postmortem and Scottish series were genotyped using dynamic allele specific hybridization (34,35).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	246	 The other series were genotyped on an ABI7900 instrument using TaqMan technology.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	247	 For the TaqMan assays, software for designing primers and probes implemented within the ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system was utilized.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	248	 The NCBI GenBank PLAU gene sequence AF377330 was used.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	249	 The pedigree structure, phenotypic and genotypic information, was maintained in PEDSYS (36) (http://www.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	250	org/sfbr/public/software/pedsys/pedsys.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	251	html), which also produced output files for the analysis performed with SOLAR, as explained subsequently.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	252	Analysis of LD among the SNPs We measured LD between the SNPs within the 10 extended LOAD families by using the GOLD program (22).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	253	 This program determines various pairwise statistical parameters for LD, such as Lewontin's standardized disequilibrium coefficient (19) D' and d2.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	254	 LD was detected from the founders and married-ins using the expectation to maximization algorithm of Slatkin and Excoffier (37).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We also detected LD within the ADs and controls from MCR, MCJ and UKy series using the same program.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	256	Tests of association between PLAU SNP haplotypes and plasma Ass levels in LOAD families We estimated the haplotypes for the five PLAU SNPs genotyped in the members of the ten LOAD families using GOLD (22) and Simwalk2 (17).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	257	 There was highly significant LD among all five PLAU SNPs, and no crossover events were observed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	258	 In our 10 extended LOAD families, we tested for association between PLAU haplotypes and plasma Ass42 phenotype using the variance components method implemented in the computer program SOLAR (20).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	259	This method, described in detail elsewhere (20), estimates the amount of variance in a quantitative trait owing to residual genetic factors (g2), shared-family environment (2h) and individual specific, random environmental factors (2e), based on the phenotype covariance between arbitrary relative pairs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	260	 The covariance matrix takes the form.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	261	where 2 is the matrix of kinship coefficients describing polygenic factors, I is the identity matrix describing sporadic environmental factors and H is the household matrix.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	262	 This is a matrix whose ijth element is equal to 1 if individuals i and j share a specified environment, and 0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	263	 Our family collection is largely composed of extended pedigrees, where we have measured the plasma Ass of most members from each family in a single batch of ELISAs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	264	 To rigorously account for any possible assay batch to batch variations that may affect the variance in plasma Ass, we included a household matrix in the models.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	265	 As almost all individuals from each family were measured in one batch, the household matrix included an element equal to 1 for those individuals from the same extended family, and 0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	266	 We realize that by doing so, we may be overly conservative.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	267	 Our collection is largely weighted towards families with high-Ass segregating within the family.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	268	 Given that the shared-family effect (household) overlaps with kinship, we may have over corrected and underestimated the shared-genetic effect by including the household term in the model.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	269	 The scalars g2, h2 and e2 are estimated using maximum likelihood.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	270	To formulate an association model for PLAU SNP haplotypes, we used the within-pedigree association model of Hopper and Mathews (21).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	271	 Under this model, the matrix of allelic sharing within pedigrees, =(ij), is defined such that ij=1 if individuals i and j are from the same pedigree and share both alleles of a haplotype identical in state, ij=1/2 if individuals i and j are from the same pedigree and share one allele identical in state and ij=0 otherwise.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	272	 Under the  association  model, SOLAR estimates the variance in the quantitative trait owing to association (a2), residual genetic factors (g2), same-household effects (h2) and environmental effects (e2).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	273	 Under the null-model of  no association , a2 is fixed to zero.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	274	 The difference between the log10 likelihoods of these two models produces a test statistic with the same distribution as the LOD score of genetic linkage analysis.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	275	 There is one degree of freedom between the two models (association fixed, association tested) and one-sided test is performed.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	276	Tests of association in the LOAD case to control series by CLUMP In our case to control series, we tested for association between the PLAU compound genotypes and LOAD using CLUMP.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	277	 The CLUMP program (23) measures the statistical significance of a variety of 2xm contingency tables by simulation.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	278	 We employed the T1 test within CLUMP, which analyzes the raw 2xm table where m is the total number of categories.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	279	 In our application of CLUMP, the 2xm table consisted of two diagnostic categories and m genotypic categories, each corresponding to a unique combination of genotypes at the five PLAU SNPs.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	280	Ass analysis Plasma Ass40 and Ass42 were measured as previously described (11).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	281	 The relationship between plasma Ass42, age and PLAU_1 genotypes in LOAD family members was initially analyzed by fitting polynomial regression curves separately for all family members with rs2227564 CC, CT, TT or CT+TT genotypes, using 10 log(Ass42) as the dependent variable and age and age(2) as the independent variables.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	282	 These analyses showed genotype-specific age-related effects on plasma Ass42 levels and indicated that plasma Ass42 increases with aging beginning at age 50 in those individuals with a CT or TT genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	283	We had used the 20 to 65 year age group in our previous studies where we found linkage between plasma Ass levels and a locus on chromosome 10 (1).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	284	 As described previously, the 20 to 65 year age group was initially chosen because of our observation that plasma Ass is elevated in individuals  < 25 and  > 65 years old.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	285	 In addition, plasma Ass appears to have complex likely deposition-related changes in individuals with AD, who are in the  > 65 age group.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	286	 In this study, we determined significant age-related effects of PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass levels in those individuals  > 50 years, depicted subsequent.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	287	 Thus, all analyses were performed in the  all ages ,  20- to 65-year-old  and   > 50 years  groups.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	288	Tests of association between the PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP and plasma Ass levels in LOAD families We applied variance components methodology implemented in the software package SOLAR (20) to estimate the effect of covariates on plasma Ass levels, while controlling for the pairwise genetic relationships and shared-family effects among family members in the extended LOAD pedigrees.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	289	We tested for the association of PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass by performing a multivariate regression analysis, while including the kinship, identity and household matrices, described earlier, in the model.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	290	 We tested two different models.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	291	 The significance and coefficients for all covariates were tested using the polygenic-screen-all option of SOLAR, which provides a p-value and coefficient by comparing a model that includes the covariate to a model that excludes it.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	292	 This option causes all covariates to stay in the model regardless of their significance.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	293	 In Model 1, the covariates tested were CT and TT genotypes, age, CT genotypexage and TT genotypexage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	294	 For Model 2, the CT and TT genotypes were pooled into a single CT+TT variable encoded as one for subjects with a CT or TT genotype and zero for those with a CC genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	295	 All analyses were performed in family members who were 50 years of age.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	296	 We selected this subset because we determined an age-related increase in plasma Ass42 levels after age 50 in those individuals with PLAU_1 genotypes CT or TT.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	297	 All analyses were performed both with all Ass values and a second time by excluding the two extreme  outliers  with plasma Ass levels  plus or minus 4 SD beyond the mean.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	298	 The PLAU_1 CTxage and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage were still significant variables in Model 1 and 2, respectively, after excluding the outliers.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	299	To determine the age-related effect of PLAU_1 genotypes and PLAU_1 genotypes on plasma Ass42 levels in LOAD family members of all ages, we fitted two non-linear regression models, while taking into account the same variance components as described earlier.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	300	 In Model 1 for family members of all ages, age(2), PLAU_1 CTxage(2) and PLAU_1 TTxage(2) were tested as covariates in addition to age, PLAU_1 CT, PLAU_1 TT, PLAU_1 CTxage and PLAU_1 TTxage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	301	 In Model 2, age(2) and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage(2) were included as covariates besides age, PLAU_1 CT+TT and PLAU_1 CT+TTxage.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	302	 The rationale for testing these non-linear models is described in detail in the main text.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	303	Logistic regression analysis to test for association with the PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP in case to controls Logistic regression analysis implemented in SAS version 8 was utilized to test for association between AD and PLAU_1 genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	304	 Initially, a model that estimated and tested the effects of PLAU_1 CT and TT genotypes separately was utilized.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	305	 The results of this analysis suggested similar risky estimates for these genotypes.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	306	 Given this result and that the PLAU_1 TT genotype is relatively rare, a second model was fitted, where CT and TT genotypes were combined into one variable, CT+TT, coded as 1 for those with CT or TT genotype and 0 for those with CC genotype.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	307	Meta-analysis of PLAU_1 (rs2227564) SNP in 10 case to control series Using the genotype counts for PLAU_1 CT+TT versus CC genotypes in AD cases and controls from the six series described in this article, we performed meta-analysis implemented in the StatsDirect statistical package.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	308	 Breslow to Day test was performed to test for heterogeneity among the samples.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	309	 Pooled OR estimates were calculated using both fixed effects and random effects model as implemented in the Mantel to Haenszel, and DerSimonian to Laird tests, respectively.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	310	Analysis of plasma and brain Ass in PLAU KO mice Plasma Ass42 and Ass40 were analyzed by sandwich ELISA as previously described (11).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	311	 Brain Ass42 and Ass40 were analyzed by ELISA following direct extraction into formic acid and neutralization as previously described (28).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	312	 All KO mice were homozygous for the null allele.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	313	 All results were normalized to the Ass present in 3- to 6-month-old control (wild-type) mice.
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	314	 Numbers analyzed were as follows: 3- to 6-month-old PLAU KO mice (16) (n=9), control mice (n=6); 11-month-old PLAU KO mice (n=2), control (n=7) mice; 3- to 6-month-old neprilysin KO mice (24) (n=3), control mice (n=3).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	315	 The neprilysin KO mice were used for additional positive control (24).
0.22005783.15615772.html.plaintext.txt	316	To evaluate brain Ass42 and Ass40, we used the same methods that we previously employed to demonstrate that endogenous brain Ass42 increases in transgenic mice expressing presenilin 1 mutations linked to early-onset familial AD (9).

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	4	The intramembranous -secretase cleavage of the -amyloid precursor protein (APP) is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Notch also undergoes a similar PS-dependent -secretase-like cleavage, resulting in the liberation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which is critically required for developmental signal transduction.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	6	 -Secretase processing of APP results in the production of a similar fragment called AICD (APP intracellular domain), which may function in nuclear signaling as well.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	7	 AICD, like NICD, is rapidly removed.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	8	 By using a battery of protease inhibitors we demonstrate that AICD, in contrast to NICD, is degraded by a cytoplasmic metalloprotease.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	9	 In vitro degradation of AICD can be reconstituted with cytoplasmic fractions obtained from neuronal and non-neuronal cells.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Taking into account the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization, we identified three candidate enzymes (neurolysin, thimet oligopeptidase, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), also known as insulysin), which all are involved in the degradation of bioactive peptides in the brain.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	11	 When insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, was added to the in vitro degradation assay, removal of AICD was efficiently blocked.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Moreover, overexpression of IDE resulted in enhanced degradation of AICD, whereas overexpression of the inactive IDE E111Q mutant did not affect AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Finally, immunodepletion of IDE significantly reduced the AICD degrading activity.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Therefore our data demonstrate that IDE, which is one of the proteases implicated in the removal of extracellular A, also removes the cytoplasmic product of -secretase cleaved APP.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	15	     INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	16	Current evidence strongly implicates that aggregation and deposition of amyloid -peptide (A)1 in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients is an invariant pathological feature (1).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	17	 A is generated from the -amyloid precursor protein (APP) by endoproteolytic processing.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Two sequential cleavages, first by -secretase and then followed by -secretase, are required to liberate A (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The intramembranous -secretase cleavage is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS) that may be unusual aspartyl proteases (4, 5), which probably constitute the active site of -secretase (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	20	 PSs are not only involved in proteolytic processing of APP but also in a similar intramembraneous cut of Notch (6).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Notch, like APP, is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes very similar endoproteolytic processing pathways (for review, see Refs.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	22	 After ectodomain shedding, Notch is cleaved within or close to its transmembrane domain by the -secretase-like S3 protease activity.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	23	 The S3 cut finally liberates the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), a key molecule in developmental signal transduction (7).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Cleavage of Notch at S3 is PS-dependent and can be blocked by -secretase inhibitors (6).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Consistent with a role of PSs in Notch signaling, the PS1/PS2 double knockout in mice has a phenotype similar to that of Notch1/ mice (8), and Notch cleavage is completely inhibited in PS-deficient cells (9, 10).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The requirement of PSs in both NICD formation and -secretase cleavage of APP provided the basis for the hypothesis that the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic domain of APP may also carry out an important function in nuclear signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Recently, several reports (11-15) described the -secretase-generated cytoplasmic fragment of APP, which we termed AICD (APP intracellular domain) (13) in analogy to NICD.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	28	 AICD is generated by a PS-dependent mechanism, since a PS1 gene knockout as well as a "dominant negative" PS1 mutation (D385N) inhibited AICD generation (13).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Moreover, -secretase inhibitors, including ones that are known to bind to PSs, also blocked AICD generation in vivo and in vitro (12, 13, 15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Interestingly, the N terminus of AICD is predominantly generated by a cut between amino acids 49 and 50 of the -amyloid domain and not by the expected -secretase cut after amino acids 40 or 42 (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	31	 This cleavage releases in vivo a 50-amino acid-long AICD fragment into the cytoplasm but not the predicted 57- or 59-amino acid fragment.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Sequence comparison revealed that this cleavage occurs at a very similar position as the S3 cleavage of Notch (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Taken together, these analogies between APP and Notch processing may favor the idea that AICD, like NICD, has a physiological function in nuclear signal transduction.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Indeed, recent findings with highly sensitive reporter gene assays supported the hypothesis that AICD may be involved in gene transcription (16).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	35	 However, AICD alone was not sufficient to allow the detection of a significant transcriptional activity in the reporter gene assays.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Only upon co-transfection of Fe65, a nuclear adaptor protein that has been shown to bind to the APP cytoplasmic tail (17-19), a significant transcriptional activity was observed (16).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	37	 This may be related to the observation that the recombinant 59-amino acid AICD-like molecules are stabilized by the co-expression of Fe65 (20), although the latter has not been confirmed by others (21).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	38	If AICD plays a role in signal transduction, its activity may be regulated.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	39	 In the case of NICD, a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway prevents NICD accumulation and constitutive signaling (6, 22, 23).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	40	 AICD is also rapidly degraded but apparently by a protease activity different from the proteasome (12, 21).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	41	 We therefore searched for the protease activity involved in AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Surprisingly, we found that AICD can be efficiently degraded by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a thiol-dependent metalloprotease known to degrade insulin, glucagon, and other peptide hormones (24).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Interestingly, IDE is also implicated in the clearance of extracellular A (for review, see Ref.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Our data therefore suggest that therapeutic stimulation of IDE activity to remove A will also affect AICD metabolism and its potential function in nuclear signal transduction.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	81	AICD Is Rapidly Degraded by a Metalloprotease Activity-- We and others have previously demonstrated that AICD can efficiently be generated in vitro in a -secretase- and PS-dependent manner from crude membrane fractions prepared by centrifugation at 10,000-16,000  x  g (11-14).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	82	 However, the in vitro generated AICD is extremely rapidly degraded, and the addition of a protease inhibitor mix containing EDTA is necessary to stabilize AICD (11, 12).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	83	 To identify the protease involved in this extremely rapid degradation pathway, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	84	 In the absence of any inhibitor, no AICD could be detected, demonstrating that at 37  degrees C AICD degradation is even faster than de novo synthesis.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Consistent with previous results a general protease inhibitor mix including EDTA inhibited AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The additional presence of the -secretase inhibitor DAPT inhibited AICD generation as expected (13).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Interestingly, the protease inhibitor mix without EDTA did not block AICD degradation, suggesting the involvement of a divalent metal ion-dependent proteolytic activity in AICD generation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Indeed, the metal-chelators EDTA and PNT allowed robust accumulation of AICD when used either alone or in combination.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	89	 However, the more specific metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, did not inhibit degradation of AICD.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	90	 AICD degradation was not affected by inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64, leupeptin), serine proteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and aspartyl proteases (pepstatin) (data not shown).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Interestingly, the potent proteasome inhibitors clasto-lactacystin -lactone and MG132 also did not block AICD degradation (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	92	 This is in contrast to NICD that has been shown to be rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Thus, although AICD and NICD are both generated by a PS-dependent protease, they are degraded by different proteolytic activities.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Taken together, we conclude that most likely a metalloprotease is involved in AICD degradation.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	101	 We first assayed crude membranes for AICD degradation after alkaline extraction with Na2CO3 that separates peripheral from integral membrane proteins (30).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	102	 2A, AICD could be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA from Na2CO3-extracted membranes, suggesting that the AICD degrading activity is either peripherally attached to the membrane or soluble.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	103	 In addition, these data confirm previous findings that -secretase is integrally membrane-bound (11).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	104	 We next separated crude membranes from residual cytosol by additional centrifugation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	105	 As shown above, when crude membranes were used in the in vitro assay, AICD could not be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Thus, these data suggest that the AICD degrading activity is a soluble protease that is primarily located within the cytoplasm.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	109	 To further prove the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, the in vitro degradation assay was performed with washed cytosol-free membranes, which allowed robust accumulation of AICD in the absence of PNT/EDTA.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	126	Identification of Candidate Enzymes Responsible for AICD Degradation-- Based on the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, we searched the MEROPS protease data base (www.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	127	uk) for candidate AICD-degrading enzymes.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	128	 This search revealed that three cytoplasmic candidate proteases from two metalloprotease families (M3A and M16A families) could be responsible for the degradation of AICD: thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, M3A family), neurolysin (M3A family), and IDE (insulysin, M16A family).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Consistent with these candidate proteases being thiol group-dependent (31, 32), the SH-alkylating agents NEM strongly inhibited AICD degradation (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Next, to discriminate which of these proteases could be involved in AICD degradation, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence or absence of dynorphin A-(1-13), a known inhibitor of TOP and neurolysin (31) and potentially also of IDE.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The dipeptide Pro-Ile, a highly specific neurolysin inhibitor (31), cFP-AAY-pAB (cFP), a potent TOP and less potent neurolysin inhibitor (33), and insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, that functions as competitive inhibitor, were investigated as well (24).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	132	 3B, weak inhibition of AICD degradation by dynorphin A-(1-13) suggests either TOP or neurolysin as a candidate protease without excluding IDE.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	133	 However, Pro-Ile did not block AICD degradation ruling out neurolysin as a candidate protease (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Since cFP did also not block AICD degradation (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	135	 3B), IDE remained the only candidate for AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	136	 Indeed, insulin competed for the AICD degrading activity present in cytosol derived from N2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Such a function is well proven for the role of PS in NICD generation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Very recently the corresponding cytoplasmic fragment of APP, AICD, has been identified (13-15).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	174	 AICD is generated by a remarkably similar molecular mechanism like NICD (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	175	 If AICD functions in nuclear signaling as proposed by Cao and Sudhof (16), one may expect a rapid clearance of this fragment, since constitutive uncontrolled signaling must be avoided.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Indeed this is the case for NICD, which is rapidly removed by an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6, 22, 23).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Here we show that AICD is not degraded by the proteasome but by a completely different protease, namely IDE (Fig.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The biochemical properties of IDE make it an ideal candidate for AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	179	 It is highly expressed in the same cellular compartment as AICD; it is a common enzyme in brain tissue, where abundant APP expression is observed, and it preferentially degrades small cytoplasmic peptides of about 20-50 amino acids in length (for review, see Ref.

0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	181	   Distinct pathways are involved in the degradation of AICD and NICD.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	182	 AICD and NICD are generated by PS-dependent -secretase and S3 protease cleavages at similar sites within the membrane.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Following liberation from the membrane, NICD, and probably also AICD, translocate to the nucleus.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	184	 In the nucleus NICD activates the transcription of Notch target genes.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Proteasomal degradation of NICD prevents its accumulation and constitutive signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	186	 In contrast to NICD, AICD is degraded by IDE that, like neprilysin, is also involved in the extracellular degradation of secreted A.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	187	We found an extremely rapid turnover of AICD, which even exceeds the kinetics of de novo production in vitro.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	188	 This is consistent with the high levels of IDE in the cytoplasm of many cells and tissues.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Although we have identified IDE as a major AICD-degrading enzyme in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lysates, we cannot exclude the possibility that other enzymes may degrade AICD in cells where IDE activity or expression is low (24).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	190	Interestingly, overexpressed artificial 59-amino acid AICD variants have been localized to the nucleus to some extent (20, 21).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	191	 However, this is in contrast to endogenous AICD with the correct N terminus that has so far not been detected within the nucleus.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Due to the rather rapid turnover of endogenous AICD and the apparent lack of its nuclear localization, one may question a function of this small peptide in nuclear signaling.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	193	 However, one needs to point out that NICD could not be detected in the nucleus for a long time, because sensitive techniques have been lacking.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Indeed using hypersensitive reporter gene assays Cao and Sudhof (16) could provide indirect evidence that a cytoplasmic fragment of APP (which was not identical to the in vivo existing AICD) complexed with Fe65, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 could mediate gene transcription.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	195	 However, nuclear transport of authentic AICD and the formation of a nuclear Tip60 Fe65 AICD complex remains to be shown.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	196	 The identification of IDE as an AICD-degrading enzyme may facilitate research on the putative role of AICD in nuclear signaling, since this function could be strongly enhanced by the inhibition of AICD degradation.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	197	Interestingly, IDE not only degrades AICD, but is also involved in the clearance of secreted A in the brain (36-40), although the major A degrading activity appears to be neprilysin (41-43).
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Surprisingly, A-degrading IDE appears to be released from living cells (36, 37) in very small amounts by so far unknown cellular mechanisms.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	199	 In contrast to the secreted A, AICD is released into the cytoplasm where it is rapidly degraded by IDE.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Since IDE is one of the A-clearing enzymes, it is tempting to increase its activity to lower the amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease patients.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Indeed this was the major goal behind the identification of the A-degrading enzymes.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The finding that IDE is not only involved in A degradation but also in the removal of AICD may have important implications for therapeutic strategies involving the manipulation of IDE activity.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	203	 If one assumes that AICD is required for nuclear signaling, its enhanced removal will interfere with AICD-mediated functions.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Moreover, other therapeutic strategies such as the inhibition of -secretase activity will also interfere with AICD production.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	205	 In that case a major reduction in ACID-mediated signaling may occur, which could also have detrimental implications.
0.43713617.11809755.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Careful analysis of AICD function and metabolism is therefore required not only to understand the biological function of APP in nuclear signaling but also for the safety of ongoing therapeutic trials.

0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	4	Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, complex, age-related disorder in which both genetic and environmental factors are important.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To integrate recent studies on genetic and environmental factors in AD into a multi-factorial disease model.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method Disease models to explain gene environment interaction in cardiovascular disease are related to observations on AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Informative, communitybased studies on the genetic epidemiology of AD are rare.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Putative risk factors from the Scottish studies include increased paternal age in AD men and coal mining as paternal occupation in both AD and vascular dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Migration effects suggest that environmental factors in high-incidence AD areas are important during adult life.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	10	Conclusions The studies summarised do not provide sufficient data to support a single comprehensive disease model of gene environment interaction in AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Future studies will require very large (600) sample sizes, molecular genetic analysis, and environmental data that span neurodevelopment and the period between disease onset and appearance of clinical symptoms.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	12	Most studies on the possible role of environmental factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have used case control methodology when seeking to relate differences in risk of AD to different exposures to putative environmental insults.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Likely candidates include head injury (Mortimer et al, 1985, 1991); low social class, especially manual occupations (Fratiglioni et al, 1993); and work with industrial solvents or printing (Graves et al, 1991; Chen et al, 1999a,b).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	14	 With the exception of pre-dementia head injury (Mortimer et al, 1985) no single environmental factor has proved robust enough to be detected in several unrelated studies (Whalley, 1991).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The proportion of cases in an early-onset AD sample that can be attributed to head injury is significant but not high, being estimated at around 4% of all cases (Mortimer et al, 1991).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	16	Measures of social class in older people are difficult to make and interpret, especially in semi-skilled and manual workers, because of age-related social drift downwards, which is particularly evident in women.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Occupational studies in AD are made more difficult because of the likely long lag period between the environmental exposures of interest and the late onset of dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In many countries, dementing illnesses do not present to clinical services and epidemiological studies must rely on specially recruited community-based, clinical or  at risk  samples.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Such recruitment is expensive and demanding of time, money and expertise.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Not surprisingly, therefore, progress in understanding the possible role of the environment in AD remains slow.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	21	More-rapid progress is being made in studies on the molecular basis and classification of AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Although early-onset AD can occur as an autosomal dominant disorder, most instances appear to be sporadic with little evidence of genetic susceptibility.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Nevertheless, Selkoe (1999) asserted that:.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	24	"estimates of the proportion of Alzheimer's cases that are genetically based have varied widely from as low as 10% to as high as 40 or 50% and some investigators believe that almost all cases will be shown eventually to have genetic determinants".
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	25	The evidence for any of these estimates is scanty.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Most molecular genetic studies (quite rightly) focus on individuals selected from families multiply affected by AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These studies have identified three genes in which mutations can directly cause AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	28	 First, mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) were reported (Goate et al, 1991; Murrell et al, 1991; Mullan et al, 1992), but these account for fewer than 0.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Two more implicated genes were identified on chromosomes 14 and 1 (Rogaev et al, 1995; Sherrington et al, 1995), termed presenilin 1 and 2, respectively (PS1 and PS2).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Christine van Broeckhoven and her colleagues (Cruts et al, 1998), surveying the frequency of mutant APP, PS1 and PS2 genes in a consecutive series of 101 early-onset AD cases, detected no APP mutations and only seven with PS1 or PS2 mutations.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	31	 These provide the best estimates yet of the proportions of early-onset cases attributable to established mutations.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	32	A fourth gene on chromosome 19 is also implicated in AD but not as a causal factor.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	33	 This is the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) locus at which a polymorphism (APOE 2, 3 or 4) is linked to expression of AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The identification of the 4 allele as a risk factor for AD was established in genetic linkage and linkage disequilibrium studies (Pericak-Vance et al, 1991; Saunders et al, 1993; Strittmatter et al, 1993).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The susceptibility to AD attributed to APOE 4 is estimated at 50-60% (Nalbantoglu et al, 1994) and remains the most robust finding in general population studies of AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Age at onset, for example, is linked to AD in an 4 dose-dependent manner (Corder et al, 1993) so that the presence of two copies of the 4 allele (4 homozygous) increases the risk of AD at an earlier age than the presence of a single copy (4 heterozygous).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	37	 There is also some evidence of a protective effect of the 2 allele (Corder et al, 1994).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The strength of the evidence in support of a major role for APOE genotype is such that models of disease transmission within large samples of families have become both feasible and potentially informative.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	39	Many commentators recognise that the risk of AD is determined partly by APOE genotype and partly by some other genetic and/or environmental factors (e.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The effects of APOE genotype and family history of dementia on risk of AD were examined by Jarvik et al (1996) in a complex segregation analysis of AD in 204 families.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Within the limitations of what may have been too small a sample to be informative, the authors rejected all simple models of AD transmission.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	42	 They concluded that more complex models were required to account for their observations and did not discount the contribution of multiple genetic factors or environmentally linked disease mechanisms.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Models of disease transmission were also developed by Lindsay Farrer's group at Boston University School of Medicine to examine the contribution of APOE genotype and to account for the effects of gender.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	44	 In what became the largest and most informative collaborative study of its kind in AD, Farrer and his colleagues (Farrer et al, 1995) assembled diagnostic and genealogical data on 549 AD patients and their first-degree relatives.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	45	 The relationship between APOE status and gender was not straightforward.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Among male relatives, the risk of AD in the 3/4 group was similar to that for the 3/3 group.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Among female relatives, on the other hand, the risk for the 3/4 group was almost twice that of the 3/3 group.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	48	 This difference suggests that gender may influence the risk of AD in 4 carriers.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	49	The same group subsequently demonstrated that in the presence of the 4 allele, a dominant model best fitted the data (Rao et al, 1996).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Single-gene inheritance also best fitted the pattern of AD incidence in families lacking 4, but the authors could not exclude more complex modes of transmission in these families.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Their research on the influence of gender indicated that susceptibility to AD differed between men and women irrespective of APOE status.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	52	 They concluded that AD is completely penetrant in women, but only 62-65% of men with a predisposing genotype developed AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	53	 In part, the difference could be accounted for by the premature death of men who were 4 carriers, as 4 conveys susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as to AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	54	 The problem was addressed in a separate survival analysis of AD relatives, which showed that women had a higher risk of AD after adjustment for the effects of CVD deaths in men.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This collaborative study presents what is probably the best example of a complex segregation analysis of carefully diagnosed AD patients.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Epidemiological studies on late-onset AD meeting precise requirements were entered into a meta-analysis by Gao et al (1998) to determine the contributions of age and gender to AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	57	 As reported for early-onset AD (McGonigal et al, 1993), Gao et al (1998) found an increased risk of dementia in women.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The work of the Boston group provides some clues to the likely biological explanations of this excess.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	59	GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF EARLYONSET AD IN SCOTLAND.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	60	Differences in the geographical distribution of early- or late-onset AD are reported but are not well understood.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The first largescale study identified differences between urban and rural populations, interpreted by Prince et al (1994) as "the protective effect of a rural environment".
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Earlier, Gurland et al (1979) had found some evidence for a higher prevalence of age-related dementia in New York than in London.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Geographical differences are perhaps most striking in studies of indigenous Black Africans from tropical Africa.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Neuropathological studies found no AD in western African samples of demented and non-demented old people (Osuntokun et al, 1991).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	65	Geographical differences between countries   between urban and rural areas and within a single large city   pose many questions in AD about exposure to putative harmful environmental factors, the frequency of mutant genes in  at risk  populations, the role of susceptibility genes (such as APOE) and the possibility that some environmental factors (e.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	66	 the rural diet) are protective.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Farrer's group (Farrer et al, 1997) was the first to address the very real possibility that some exposures may censor  at risk  populations, producing spurious gender effects.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Their finding that the increased contribution of 4 in women was not attributable to artefact is of considerable relevance to future studies in AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	69	Scotland is well placed for the study of such complex interactions.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Most of the population lives in a central belt running roughly west to east along a valley that divides the Southern Uplands from the Scottish Highlands.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The western end of the belt contains over half the Scottish population in a conurbation of about 2.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	72	5 million people centred on the city of Glasgow.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	73	 At the eastern end of the valley lies Edinburgh, the capital city.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Traditional industries such as coal mining, steel production and shipbuilding have provided labour-intensive employment for most of the 20th century in the west.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	75	 In the east, service industries and light manufacturing have predominated.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Across this economic gradient in Scotland there is a well-established  health divide .
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Age at death is lower, and death from vascular disease (notably cerebrovascular disease and myocardial infarction) more frequent in the west than in the east.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	78	 These differences have been convincingly linked to socio-economic deprivation (McLoone  and  Boddy, 1994).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	79	During the period 1955-1974, almost all early-onset AD cases presenting in Edinburgh came under the care of Dr Elizabeth Robertson.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	80	 She had made AD her special interest, and having established post-mortem facilities in the principal mental hospital, she obtained neuropathological confirmation in 95% of her cases.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Non-random geographical distribution of early-onset AD was demonstrated within Edinburgh with the highest incidence in an inner-city tenemented area (Whalley  and  Holloway, 1985).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Two apparently unrelated cases presented from the same apartment some 15 years apart.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Previously, the pedigrees of all 69 cases had been examined in Register House, Edinburgh (Whalley et al, 1982).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	84	 None of the cases shared common ancestors and no family members, as far as could be ascertained from death certificates, had died of causes or in circumstances suggestive of dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Analysis of the public water supply in 1986 to each address of presentation detected no differences between areas (unpublished observations).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	86	Having detected a non-random distribution of pathologically confirmed earlyonset AD in Edinburgh (Whalley  and  Holloway, 1985), we wished to examine this on a much larger scale.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	87	 Specifically, we wished to test the proposed association between early-onset AD and aluminium content of the public water supply (Martyn et al, 1989), but this proved untestable largely because Scottish records revealed that the quality of the public water supply at any location has varied substantially over time.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	88	 Variations arise partly because principal urban areas can switch between several alternative supplies as necessary, and partly because of continuous improvements in water quality and analytical techniques during the lifetime of our subjects.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Our approach was to examine geographical variation in early-onset AD using small-area geographical analysis (Whalley et al, 1995a).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	90	 This relies on the division of the entire Scottish population into small areas (by postcode), each with about 5000 individuals.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	91	 There was non-random geographical distribution of early-onset AD but not of the comparison conditions (vascular dementia, motor neuron disease, prostatic or ovarian cancers).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	92	 These geographical differences could not be attributed to methodological artefact as other techniques of case-finding demonstrated the same differences between regions of Scotland.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	93	 In the same study, there were geographical variations in early-onset vascular dementia and the frequency of cerebrovascular events, suggesting that some risk factors are shared between the two conditions (Starr et al, 1996).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	94	Non-random geographical variation in the incidence of early-onset AD in Scotland was mostly located in small areas of the country's densely populated central belt.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	95	 These were concentrated in the large conurbations of Glasgow, the adjacent decaying industrial area of North Lanarkshire and relatively impoverished areas of Edinburgh adjacent to the Lothian coalfields.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	96	 Rural parts of Scotland were relatively spared (Thomas et al, 1997b).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Earlier reports (Copeland et al, 1987; Prince et al, 1994) suggested that factors associated with urban life may increase the risk of early-onset AD, possibly through the same mechanisms that link urbanisation with increased incidence of cerebrovascular events (Starr et al, 1996).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	98	In a second analysis of the epidemiology of early-onset AD in Scotland, we related geographical variation to exposures to possible risk factors.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Once more, we found that Scotland had been subject to detailed epidemiological analysis so that a great deal was known about the ecology of socio-economic deprivation in this country.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Carstairs  and  Morris (1991) classified all of Scotland's small areas using a deprivation index based on an unweighted combination of four standardised variables (overcrowding, male unemployment, low social class and no car ownership).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	101	 Socioeconomic deprivation measured in this way was significantly related to the incidence of vascular dementia but not to that of early-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Contrary to expectations concerning hazardous exposures in some industries, specific occupations were not overrepresented among men with early-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	103	Surprisingly, increased paternal age was associated with early-onset AD in men but not in women.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	104	 An earlier small study of AD in Scotland (Whalley et al, 1982) had detected increased parental age in AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	105	 This observation was confirmed in other studies, but much later a larger study (Farrer et al, 1991) reported decreased paternal age in late-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	106	 This latter study contained sufficient statistical power to distinguish between maternal and paternal contributions to parental age effects in dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	107	 In the Scottish studies, the most plausible biological explanation of the putative association between increased paternal age and the incidence of early-onset AD would be that fresh gene mutation is more likely to occur with advanced paternal age, as reported in some studies that distinguish between  sporadic  and  familial  instances of autosomal dominant disorders such as Marfan's syndrome (Emery, 1986).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	108	 Increased paternal age and paternal coalmining occupation acted independently of one another and were not associated with specific geographical areas at the time of presentation.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	109	Epidemiological studies of this type which can draw upon all relevant health data and public record statistics for a defined period of time (in this instance 1974-1988) prompt exploration of the temporal associations between exposures to various risk factors.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Elegant statistical models are now available to examine the putative relationships between birth characteristics and later environmental established risk factors for hypertension and vascular disease (Elford et al, 1990).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	111	 When differences are detected between geographical areas and there is sizeable migration between those areas, this can provide useful insights into the likely timing and mechanism of the environmental effect (Bentham, 1988).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	112	The Scottish studies therefore allow related hypotheses to be tested by examination of the time from clinical presentation to death (survival time) in small areas of high incidence compared with those of low incidence (McGonigal et al, 1992; Thomas et al, 1997a).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	113	 In addition, public record data provided information about place and circumstances at birth and presentation to hospital services.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	114	 The length of survival after presentation with early-onset AD distinguished between areas of high and low incidence, in that patients presenting in high-incidence areas had significantly shorter survival times than those presenting in low-incidence areas.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	115	 Those born in high-incidence areas who presented in low-incidence areas survived as long as those who were born and presented in low-incidence areas.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Those born in low-incidence areas who presented in high-incidence areas had a shorter survival time.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	117	The worse prognosis for early-onset AD could be explained by one or more of several factors.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	118	 For example, it could be associated with a more severe variant of the disorder (Henderson et al, 1992).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	119	 If our measure of migration (the difference between place of birth and place of presentation) is valid and approximates to environmental exposures in adult life, then it becomes plausible to argue that the decreased survival rate in those who are either born in or move to areas of high incidence is explained by exposure to the harmful effects of the environment in the high-incidence area.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	120	 This inference is supported by the observation that those born in high-incidence areas but who moved to low-incidence areas where they presented had much better survival, confidently linked to mitigation of the disease process.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	121	 A similar finding was reported by Horner  and  Chirikos (1987) in their study of survival in gastrointestinal cancers.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	122	 Here, the complexity of the statistical model becomes evident; high-incidence areas for early-onset AD may also be characterised by increased incidence of other diseases that can cause premature death.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	123	GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS: POSSIBLE LINKS.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	124	Small areas of high incidence of early-onset AD may be explained by genetic relatedness such that mutated causal genes or genes that convey increased susceptibility to this disorder are more frequent in these localities.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	125	 However, geographical variation related to locally increased gene frequency should be most obvious at time of birth and less obvious with the effects of migration over time.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	126	 One of the limitations of our statistical analyses was that data on place of birth were insufficient to allow an informative analysis of geographical variation.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	127	 However, other factors present at time of birth (paternal age and occupation) certainly contributed to the increased risk of early-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	128	 When we estimated the aetiological fraction attributable to other established risk factors for AD we calculated that the proportion attributable to being female was 25%, to high paternal age 9.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	129	3% (male patients only) and to having a coal-miner father 10% (both genders).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	130	 These factors together appear to act independently and contribute 45% to the total.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	131	 A further 20%, we estimated, was attributable to environmental exposures in later life.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	132	The effects of kinship The genetic epidemiology of early-onset AD in Scotland may be partly explained if cases in high-incidence areas occurred more often among persons who were blood relations than might be expected by chance.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Because this study was based on a historical cohort with few surviving members, informant histories were not available to us nor was it possible to obtain blood samples for genetic analysis.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	134	 To address the question of genetic relatedness we developed a simple measure of the effects of kinship on the incidence of early-onset AD in Scotland.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The hypothesis tested was that if a set of people with a certain characteristic, such as disease phenotype, are related to each other more often than would be expected by chance, then some familial contribution to that characteristic can be inferred.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	136	 This familial contribution may then prove to have a genetic basis.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	137	 We argued that the more often members of a set with a particular characteristic are related by blood, the greater the familial contribution to that characteristic.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	138	Case kinship analyses of this type were undertaken for one area of high incidence in North Lanarkshire (Whalley et al, 1995a).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We traced the ancestors of affected persons back to their great-grandparents' generation from records held in Register House, Edinburgh.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	140	 We used great-grandmothers as index-common ancestors, maternal relationship being more frequently specified on birth certificates than paternal relationship because of illegitimacy.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	141	 When available, we used great-grandfathers' names from marriage certificates and grandparents' birth certificates to verify the correct identification of cases' great-grandmothers.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	142	 We estimated the  at risk  ancestral population in this area of high incidence (North Lanarkshire) from census data between 1911 and 1921.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	143	 We also recognised that the  at risk  ancestral population requires a temporal as well as a spatial definition and so we used grandparental birth data of the early-onset AD cases to provide this.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The probability of two people being related to each other at the maternal, grandmaternal and great-grandmaternal levels is the product of the number of mothers, grandmothers, etc.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	145	, of each person contained within the  at risk  ancestral population (the method is detailed in Starr et al, 1997a,b).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	146	 No shared great-grandmothers were found among early-onset AD cases presenting in the high-incidence area of North Lanarkshire.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	147	Our estimates of the founder population of great-grandmothers in North Lanarkshire as a whole provided an  at risk  estimate that allowed kinship by shared great-grandmothers to be calculated.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	148	 The minimum kinship estimate was 1.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	149	 If there were no familial contribution to raised incidence in Lanarkshire, the kinship estimate range would have included 1.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	150	 We concluded that in North Lanarkshire familial factors were probably involved but because of the small sample size (69) we could provide no direct evidence of this.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	151	 However, part of the clustering of early-onset AD cases in Lanarkshire is probably caused by some familial contribution.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	152	 This may act independently of the familial contribution to cerebrovascular disease (Starr et al, 1997a).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	153	Paternal age and occupation The observations that the fathers of men with early-onset AD were generally older, and more likely to be coal miners (19.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	154	8%), than the fathers of control subjects (9.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	155	8%) were unique, and require separate consideration.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	156	 It is difficult to relate increased paternal age and specific occupations to a biological disease mechanism without first considering the possibility of paternal occupational exposure to a mutagenic hazard (e.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	157	 as may occur in workers who process nuclear fuel) which might alter germ cells, reduce male fertility and increase the risk of specific disorders in offspring (as in the proposed increase in leukaemia among the children of nuclear fuel processing workers).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	158	In a pioneering study of early-onset AD cases in Minnesota, Heston  and  Mastri (1977) found increased familial incidence of Down's syndrome and lymphomas.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The familial link with Down's syndrome has proved robust (van Duijn et al, 1991) and remains unexplained.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Heston  and  Mastri (1977) linked this observation to the possibility that a major gene effect in AD perturbed microfilament function, an essential component of cytoplasmic movements of all types (Smith, 1996).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Impaired microfilamental contractions would result in chromosomal non-disjunction (as in Down's syndrome)   an idea that was developed further by Potter (1991).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Motility of spermatozoa also relies on contractions of microfilaments and microtubules.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Reduced spermatozoal motility causes decreased male fertility and this is sometimes associated with increased paternal age.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Microtubules are composed of tubulin and are quite distinct from the microfilamental proteins, which are composed mainly of actin.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Microtubules, like microfilaments, are also well known to be involved in cell movement.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Tubulin is polymerised and stabilised with the help of microtubular assembly proteins.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Tau is a microtubular assembly protein coded for by a single gene on chromosome 17.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Several familial dementias are already linked to mutations of the tau gene (Spillantini  and  Goedert, 1998) but these do not include early-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Given the central role played by tau protein and its assembly in its hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated form into paired helical filaments in AD, genetic contributions to AD that influence tau processing could prove important.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Fresh gene mutations linked to increased paternal age and occupation may contribute to apparent sporadic AD cases.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	171	Coal-mining families in Scotland in the early part of the 20th century were severely disadvantaged.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Several adult-onset diseases are linked to deprivation in childhood and infancy, but so far no convincing case has been made to link such deprivation with dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Our studies linked paternal coal mining to early-onset AD and to early-onset vascular dementia, which suggests that this is a non-specific effect.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Substantial data already link adult poverty to premature death and there are some data to support the hypothesis that childhood privations, perhaps beginning in utero, predisposed to early death from vascular disease (Williams et al, 1979; Barker et al, 1990; Hales et al, 1991; Barker  and  Martyn, 1992).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Furthermore, other data also show that these associations vary over time and may even be increasing in some parts of the developed world (Forsdahl, 1978; Doornbos  and  Kromhout, 1990; Eames et al, 1993; Kunst  and  Mackenbach, 1994).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	176	The cerebral reserve hypothesis is proposed to explain individual differences in susceptibility to dementia (Satz, 1993; Schofield et al, 1995; Stern et al, 1995; Mori et al, 1997).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	177	 In normal neurodevelopment a  reserve capacity  is acquired to withstand brain insults.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	178	 When progressive brain disease supervenes, it must first overcome the  cerebral reserve capacity  before symptoms of dementia appear.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	179	 The privations experienced by the children of coal miners could be linked to a failure to acquire sufficient cerebral reserve capacity to withstand the onset of age-related neurodegeneration.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	180	 Consequently, the symptoms of dementia (either AD or vascular dementia) tend to develop prematurely.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	181	 The socioeconomic disadvantages of an early life spent in an impoverished household may be linked to the frequent observation that low educational attainments increase the risk of late-onset AD.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Low educational attainment was also linked to restricted neurodevelopment (Porter  and  Pavitt, 1987), although the evidence is not strong (Deary  and  Caryl, 1997).
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Katzman (1993) and Mortimer et al (1991) reviewed studies to date and concluded that one of several plausible biological explanations could be involved, but that the data at that time were hardly more than suggestive.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Subsequent examinations (Evans et al, 1993; Stern et al, 1994; Cobb et al, 1995; Mortel et al, 1995; Plassman et al, 1995; Schmand et al, 1995, 1997a,b) of the proposed association do not as yet allow a firm conclusion to be drawn.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	185	Snowdon et al (1996) provided what became the best-known study on this question   largely, it seems, because their subjects (elderly nuns) were such an unusual sample.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	186	 As in earlier studies, Snowdon and his colleagues were constrained by the lack of good-quality, well-validated measures of childhood mental ability and were obliged to use proxy data.

0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	191	 A comprehensive multi-factorial model of early-onset AD must distinguish between genetic factors related to ancestral genes, fresh gene mutation, gender and agerelated genes, the harmful effects on neurodevelopment of privations such as malnutrition in early life, and exposure to a harmful environment in mid-life.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	192	 If the dietary environment includes nutrients with known advantages for nervous development (e.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	193	 essential fatty acids in the early diet, or antioxidants in fresh fruit and vegetables in late diet), then the onset of a dementing illness may be postponed.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	194	 If it is also supposed that age at onset of AD is at least partly determined by exposure to a harmful environment in early life, this could implicate a reduction in the  cerebral reserve capacity  available to adapt to insult, accelerating the onset of symptoms of dementia.
0.25876758.11315226.html.plaintext.txt	195	This brief review has focused on some of the most pressing problems in understanding the occurrence of AD.

0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although insulin administration causes an increase in the synthesis of some specific proteins, the effect of insulin on the level of total cellular protein is attributable almost entirely to decreased protein degradation (2, 3).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	19	 However, the proteolytic systems regulated by insulin are unclear.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	20	 In a variety of cell types, the absence of insulin and amino acids induces formation of autophagic vacuoles and subsequent lysosomal degradation, which is reversible by the addition of insulin (2, 4, 5).

0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The ubiquitin pathway requires both ATP and conjugation of a small polypeptide, ubiquitin (Ub), to lysine residues of target substrates (11, 12).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This ligation of ubiquitin by a series of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes is repeated, to produce polyubiquitin chains, which serve as targeting signals for degradation of the protein by the 26S proteasome.

0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The IDE is a primarily cytosolic enzyme that is the initial member of a family of zinc metalloproteinases (22), and it is responsible for the degradation of insulin in most tissues (23, 24).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	34	 In the present study, we found that insulin inhibited ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in an in vitro extract, and that insulin increased the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in cultured hepatoma cells.

0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	162	 A possible mechanism for this insulin action might be alteration of IDE association with the proteasome.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	163	 If this were the case, then insulin treatment of the IDE-proteasome complex (100,000 x g pellet) would displace IDE from the proteasome and alter its sedimentation pattern.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	164	 To test this hypothesis, the 100,000 x g pellet was incubated with and without 1 nM insulin, then analyzed by glycerol gradients (Fig.

0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	176	     Discussion Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   In this study, we have expanded our previous findings of insulin regulation of proteasome activity (17, 18) to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system involved in a number of critical cellular processes, including transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation, and cell cycle control (see Ref.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Insulin inhibited ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation in an in vitro extract, at concentrations similar to those seen previously for peptide degradation by the proteasome (17).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Furthermore, the inhibition correlated with the level of insulin degradation in the system and was eliminated in the presence of an anti-IDE antibody, suggesting the involvement of IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Although the IC50 for inhibition by insulin (50 nM) was somewhat high, relative to circulating levels of insulin (10 pM to 1 nM), the lysozyme degradation assay is slow, and it requires enzyme levels above those for optimal enzyme-substrate kinetics (22).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	180	 On the other hand, the cell culture experiments (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	181	 4) showed insulin inhibition of the ubiquitin pathway well within the physiological range of insulin.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Because the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway requires conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates, insulin could have been inhibiting the ubiquitin-conjugation step, but our results showed that insulin, at doses sufficient to inhibit proteolysis, did not reduce ubiquitin conjugation to the substrate protein (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	183	 2), and there was no evidence of the formation of competitive ubiquitin-insulin conjugates (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	184	 This leaves the degradation step as the site of action by insulin.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In cultured cells, physiological levels of insulin induced the accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	186	 4), consistent with inhibition of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	187	There are several possible mechanisms for insulin regulation of proteasome activity.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Insulin has been implicated in the control of levels of mRNA for ubiquitin, proteasome, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (35, 36, 37), but this has been suggested to be via activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor (38).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	189	 Though these mechanisms may indeed contribute to insulin regulation of proteolysis, they do not explain how insulin inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway using in vitro cell extracts, nor do they explain rapid regulation of cellular proteolysis by insulin.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Another possibility is phosphorylation of the proteasome, in response to insulin, although the effect of phosphorylation on proteasome catalytic activity is conflicting (39, 40, 41).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Again, this mechanism is not supported by the earlier in vitro studies, because phosphorylation should not occur under these conditions.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	192	A novel possibility is that insulin may inhibit the proteasome through an associated protein, IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	193	 The catalytic properties of the proteasome can vary widely, depending on its association with regulatory proteins (42).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Previously, we showed insulin inhibition of the proteasome in vitro and in cultured cells (17, 18, 19, 21).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Removal of IDE from the extracts or introduction of a neutralizing antibody into cells resulted in a loss of insulin regulation of the proteasome (17, 19, 21).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	196	 In the present study, using a preparation designed to enrich for the 26S proteasome from muscle, we found copurification of IDE by both insulin-degrading activity (Table 2) and by detection with an IDE-specific antibody (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Although this purification series is designed to purify 26S proteasome, glycerol gradient analysis of the 100,000 x g pellet showed that the majority of the proteasome sedimented in the 20S region, with much less in the 26S region, a result of rapid equilibration between the two forms, as shown previously (43).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	198	 In this 100,000 x g preparation, IDE was found to cosediment with the 20S proteasome on glycerol gradients (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	199	 7), as well as with the 26S form when the blots were overexposed.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Because of the rapid dissociation of the 26S proteasome, attempts to reapply the 26S-sedimenting material to conclusively show IDE association were unsuccessful, and thus the possibility that the IDE detected in the 26S region is caused by contamination by 20S-associated IDE cannot be ruled out.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Nevertheless, the copurification of IDE through several steps, including the 100,000 x g pelleting step, suggests that IDE may be associated with the 26S, as well as the 20S proteasome forms.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	202	 On the other hand, glycerol gradients using the 100,000 x g supernatant, presumably free of 26S proteasome, showed only migration of free IDE in a region that did not correspond to either the 20S or 26S proteasome (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	203	 These data suggest that IDE can exist in at least two separate populations, one associated with proteasomes, and another free form, with an altered conformation that results in a different sedimentation pattern on glycerol density gradients.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	204	 This finding may explain the widely disparate reports of characteristics of IDE, including molecular size and catalytic properties (24, 44).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	205	  If insulin inhibition is mediated by IDE, then insulin treatment might alter IDE and, as a result, its sedimentation on glycerol density gradients.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Indeed, insulin treatment (Fig.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	207	 8) resulted in displacement of IDE from the proteasome-associated regions to the sedimentation area of free IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	208	 These data suggest a shift in IDE conformation after treatment with insulin, resulting in dissociation of IDE from the proteasome, and the data imply a greater activity of the proteasome when associated with IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	209	 This notion is supported by our previous data, which showed a reduction in proteasome activity when it was separated from IDE by chromatography, and an elevation when they were recombined (17).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The displacement of IDE from the proteasome provides a means by which insulin may regulate the activity of the 26S and 20S proteasomes.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Insulin treatment of the complex results in removal of a proteasome regulatory protein, IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	212	 Because previous studies (21) showed inhibition of non-ATP-dependent proteasome activity by other high-affinity IDE substrates (e.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	213	 IGF-II), whereas lower-affinity substrates (e.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	214	 IGF-I) had little or no effect, experiments are currently underway to determine whether these other IDE substrates have effects on ATP-dependent degradation and IDE-proteasome association, or if these effects are specific for insulin.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	215	 Last, though the possibility remains that one or more fragments of insulin act to indirectly inhibit the proteasome, previous studies suggested that insulin fragments generated by IDE have little effect on proteasome activity (21).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	216	Because IDE copurified with the proteasome through the 100,000 x g precipitation step and was detected in the 26S region and the 20S region on glycerol gradients, these data are the first to suggest that IDE may be associated with both the 26S and 20S proteasomes.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	217	 Because the 20S catalytic core is a common element of both forms of the proteasome, it seems likely that IDE associates with this catalytic core as an accessory or regulatory protein, which would provide a mechanism by which insulin inhibits both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent proteasome activity.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	218	 The presence of IDE with the proteasome is accompanied by an elevated level of activity, possibly through an allosteric effect on the proteasome.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	219	 Insulin treatment results in IDE dissociation from the proteasome and a reduction in proteasome activity.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This mechanism would be consistent with the effects seen with in vitro extracts and in cultured cell experiments.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	221	 Furthermore, this mechanism supports earlier results suggesting that IDE was responsible for mediating insulin regulation of the proteasome (17, 19, 20, 21).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	222	There are a number of possible reasons why other studies have not detected the presence of IDE in proteasome preparations.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Many of the routine proteasome purification strategies use EDTA in the buffers.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	224	 Because IDE is a metalloproteinase, EDTA treatment causes inhibition of the insulin-degrading activity of IDE.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	225	 Furthermore, EDTA treatment results in a reduction in the ability of IDE to associate with the proteasome (20).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	226	 In addition, the use of anion exchange as a late step in the purification procedure can itself result in dissociation of the proteasome from IDE (16, 17).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	227	 Finally, as shown in the present studies, the level of insulin degradation in the 26S region of the glycerol gradients is low, compared with that in the 20S and free regions, possibly because of inhibition of IDE by ATP (45).
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	228	Although the regulation of protein turnover by insulin has long been established, the proteolytic pathways involved have been unclear.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	229	 Our results provide the first demonstration that insulin inhibits ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome in vitro and in cultured cells.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	230	 These findings extend the cellular processes controlled by insulin to include the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a major cellular degradation system.
0.22505026.10875252.html.plaintext.txt	231	 Because of the growing awareness of the importance of the ubiquitin pathway in the control of cellular processes, these data provide new understanding into the processes involved in a major action of insulin, the control of protein levels by regulation of proteolysis.

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	4	Background The concept of vascular dementia has a long history but its usefulness as a diagnostic category has been called into question.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	5	Aims To evaluate vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia and the interface between cerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	6	Method The literature on this topic was selectively reviewed and synthesised.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	7	Results Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease are also risk factors for dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	8	 However, the course of dementia, once it has developed, appears to be frequently determined by Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	9	Conclusions As a public health measure, modification of vascular risk represents a potentially powerful means to prevent dementia through delaying its onset.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	10	 However, an effect on progression of dementia, once it has developed, has yet to be established.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The traditional view of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease as distinguishable conditions is becoming steadily less tenable.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	12	Once upon a time, around the first half of the last century, late-onset dementia was viewed as an essentially homogeneous condition.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The main underlying cause was assumed to be atherosclerosis: a pathological substrate for  old age .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Pioneering work around the 1960s and early 1970s challenged this assumption, establishing the importance of Alzheimer pathological changes in the majority of cases.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	15	 However, multiple cerebral infarctions also appeared to underlie a substantial proportion.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	16	 This led to the division of dementia into the two conditions of Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This system has persisted to this day but is coming under increasing criticism, particularly from those who wish to investigate vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	18	 In the following sections the current status of and future directions for  vascular dementia  are considered, both as a diagnostic category and as a heading for a broad field of research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	19	Research diagnostic criteria treat Alzheimer's disease as a diagnosis of exclusion (McKhann et al, 1984).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	20	 This system may be useful for examining issues relating to this disorder as a  pure  entity.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, it may also miss potentially important influences from factors such as vascular disease, which have been excluded by definition.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	22	 In addition, having begun by excluding major vascular disease such as clinical stroke or multiple cerebral infarctions on computed tomographic imaging, studies that use this diagnostic system now have to consider what to do with evidence of more subtle, subclinical disease, such as white-matter abnormalities seen on magnetic resonance imaging.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Increasingly sophisticated measurements of cerebrovascular disease in vivo raise the question of where exclusion criteria should stop.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	24	 If detectable levels of vascular disease continue to be excluded, the  pure  Alzheimer's disease group will become progressively smaller, defining an increasingly select group of persons who, for whatever reason, have remained free of any vascular disease into old age.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The question, of course, is what level of vascular disease may cause dementia; this cannot be answered by using criteria that assume that it is or is not a cause.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	26	A major problem with the concept of multi-infarct dementia has been that diagnostic criteria tried to do the same thing as those for Alzheimer's disease: that is, to define a  pure  entity.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, while Alzheimer's disease at least has a reasonably well-defined pathological basis, the same is not true for dementia related to cerebrovascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	28	  Vascular dementia  subsumed multi-infarct dementia as a term because of recognition of this heterogeneity, and large numbers of other subtypes have subsequently been proposed (Konno et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	29	 These range from syndromes where dementia appears to have resulted from small, discrete  strategic  infarctions (such as bilateral thalamic infarction or lesions of the angular gyrus), to dementia associated with more diffuse cerebrovascular disease: ischaemic or haemorrhagic, cortical or subcortical (Brun, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	30	 More diffuse disease obviously exists across a spectrum of severity and with advancing age is increasingly likely to be comorbid with Alzheimer's disease, raising questions as to how (or whether) the two should be distinguished in a diagnostic system.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	31	 An additional obstacle for research is that the term  vascular dementia  makes assumptions about causation and therefore is of limited use when it comes to investigating potential causes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	32	 It would not be considered particularly noteworthy if a study was to report that people who have a stroke are more likely to have hypertension or diabetes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Similarly, it would not be very surprising if they were found to have higher mortality or higher levels of depression.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	34	 The problem with  vascular dementia  as a term is that comparisons with Alzheimer's disease or control groups are inevitably comparisons of populations with different rates of cerebrovascular disease, and it is impossible to conclude what is related to cerebrovascular disease and what is related to a particular dementia syndrome.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	35	It is perhaps preferable to consider vascular dementia as a series of questions rather than a diagnosis.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Does vascular disease cause dementia? What type (or types) of dementia does it cause? What can we do about it?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	37	DOES VASCULAR DISEASE CAUSE DEMENTIA?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	38	Systems of dementia classification have been a major obstacle for investigating this question, as previously discussed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Another problem is that age groups in which dementia is most common contain, to an extent, healthy survivors with respect to vascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Also, people with both conditions together have a higher mortality and are therefore less likely to be identified in both cross-sectional and prospective studies.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	41	Particularly high rates of dementia are observed following clinical stroke, with an approximately nine-fold increase in risk over the first year followed by a smaller, two-fold raised annual risk which has been found to persist at least 25 years later (Kokmen et al, 1996).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia have also been established as risk factors for dementia in large prospective studies (Stewart, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Early reports that smoking might be a protective factor, at least for Alzheimer's disease, have not been confirmed by more rigorously designed investigations which, if anything, report a raised risk of both subtypes of dementia in smokers (Ott et al, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	44	 An important issue arising from these studies concerns the stage of cognitive decline at which these factors have an effect.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Raised blood pressure in mid-life is, for instance, a strong risk factor for later cognitive impairment (Elias et al, 1993).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, blood pressure in later life tends to be lower in association with dementia (Skoog et al, 1996).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Therefore hypertension appears to exert its effect at an early stage in cognitive decline and the association may no longer be apparent by the time cognitive function has deteriorated sufficiently to be classified as dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The same pattern has been described for raised cholesterol concentrations (Notkola et al, 1998), and has important potential implications for preventive or therapeutic intervention.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	49	WHAT TYPE OF DEMENTIA DOES IT CAUSE?.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	50	Again, traditional diagnostic criteria have hampered investigation of this question.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	51	 An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia are risk factors not only for the development of vascular dementia but also for Alzheimer's disease (Stewart, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Community-based research can be criticised in that neuroimaging has not been routinely used in diagnostic assessment, so that subclinical levels of cerebrovascular disease may have been missed and  mixed dementia  misidentified as Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	53	 This issue, however, should be more a consideration of mechanisms by which vascular risk factors are associated with dementia rather than one of arbitrarily defined diagnostic categories.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Post-stroke studies have found that dementia appears to follow an Alzheimer's disease-like course in the majority of cases (Kokmen et al, 1996) and that approximately 10% of people with post-stroke dementia have had gradually deteriorating cognitive function before the stroke occurred (Pohjasvaara et al, 1999).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Since Alzheimer's disease has a long latency period, it can be assumed that a substantial further proportion may have had subclinical disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	56	What is becoming increasingly apparent is that dementia associated with vascular disease frequently resembles Alzheimer's disease in its clinical course and, in many cases, is not obviously explained by a multiple infarction mechanism.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	57	 One possibility is that vascular processes cause a gradually progressive dementia syndrome.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	58	 However, recent pathological studies have suggested that isolated cerebrovascular disease (i.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	59	 with no Alzheimer lesions) is rarely found in association with dementia (Hulette et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	60	 These findings contrast with those from the early post-mortem series, although it should be borne in mind that people with dementia in the late 1960s would be expected to display much more florid and severe cerebrovascular disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	61	 The next question is whether vascular disease may directly cause or  drive  Alzheimer's disease processes.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Many potential mechanisms exist and have been proposed for vascular induction of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid deposition secondary to ischaemia or peri-infarct inflammation and microglial activation.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Abnormal protein glycation may provide a link between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease such as vascular amyloid deposition and microangiopathy.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype may also provide a potential explanation for the association.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	66	 However, although the ApoE 4 variant is associated with increased vascular risk, neither lipid levels nor vascular disease have been found to be mediating factors between 4 and risk of Alzheimer's disease (Prince et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	67	Although many feasible mechanisms have been proposed for direct links between vascular and Alzheimer's disease processes, pathological evidence so far suggests that they interact principally in their clinical effects.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The  nun study  found no direct association between cerebrovascular disease and level of Alzheimer pathology, but instead found that less Alzheimer pathology was  required  to produce dementia if cerebrovascular disease was also present (Snowdon et al, 1997).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	69	 One possible explanation is that memory impairment secondary to hippocampal pathology in Alzheimer's disease is more likely to manifest as clinical dementia if there is also impairment of executive function secondary to vascular subcortical pathology.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Executive function impairment is an important, although frequently unmeasured, factor associated with memory decline, and decline in executive function alone, an important potential consequence of cerebrovascular disease, has been suggested as a dementia syndrome in its own right (Royall, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	71	Considering the length of time vascular disease has been accepted as a common and potentially reversible risk factor for dementia, evidence for interventions to modify this risk has been woefully scant.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	72	 As summarised in Table 1, the likely success of any intervention depends crucially on the mechanism of association.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Of particular interest for clinicians is the extent to which patients with dementia may benefit from treatment of vascular disease or risk factors.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	74	 However, there has been no optimally designed trial of such interventions.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Treatment of vascular risk factors may have an impact on cognitive decline through preventing stroke   and increasing evidence suggests that there may be no upper age limit for stroke prevention (Staessen et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	76	 In addition, there would be benefit if vascular disease was accelerating the progression of Alzheimer lesions.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	77	 On the other hand, if vascular disease predominantly accelerates the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease, treatment should be directed at Alzheimer's disease rather than the vascular component once dementia has developed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This issue has become particularly important with the licensing of pharmacological agents for use in Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	79	 If stroke continues to be considered as an exclusion criterion, a large number of people with Alzheimer's disease will fail to receive appropriate treatment because of comorbid disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Whatever lies ahead for the treatment of dementia associated with cerebro-vascular disease, the potential for its prevention is likely to be substantial since vascular risk factors have high prevalence rates.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	81	 A modest reduction in vascular risk across a population could therefore be expected to result in a large reduction in future cases of dementia, if only through delaying its clinical onset.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Supporting this, preliminary findings from the large Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst Eur) trial of antihypertensive treatment in older people suggested a 50% reduction in incident dementia (principally Alzheimer's disease) occurring in those treated with a calcium channel blocker compared with placebo (Forette et al, 1998).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	83	View this table:    Table 1 Pathways of association between vascular disease and dementia and their implications with respect to preventive or therapeutic interventions  .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	84	Further investigation into mechanisms underlying links between vascular and Alzheimer pathological processes is likely to provide important avenues for risk modification.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	85	 In addition, evidence from adequately designed therapeutic and preventive trials, even if negative, is likely to provide useful information regarding underlying mechanisms.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	86	 What may well become increasingly apparent is that dementia is a very late stage to be considering useful intervention.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	87	 One challenge is to develop public health strategies that can affect large populations, reducing vascular risk earlier in life with an aim of decreasing the burden of dementia for that generation 10-20 years later.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, from a clinical standpoint (directed towards individual-rather than population-level risk) there will also need to be a move towards identifying cognitive decline at a much earlier stage than dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	89	 In particular, with regard to vascular disease, the focus on memory decline influenced by Alzheimer's disease will need to shift towards an appreciation of executive function impairment (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	90	What, therefore, is vascular dementia? It is certainly a convenient subject heading for a rapidly accelerating field of research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	91	 What is less clear is whether it retains any usefulness as a diagnosis.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Vascular dementia implies a primary cause (cerebrovascular disease) linked with a specific consequence (a distinguishable dementia syndrome).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	93	 However, increasing evidence suggests that dementia associated with vascular disease involves a very broad spectrum of manifestations, from strategic infarct syndromes to Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	94	 In addition, although vascular disease is a powerful risk factor for dementia, it is questionable how often it is actually the sole cause of dementia in the absence of underlying vulnerability or comorbid disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Dementia research has suffered, in common with other areas of epidemiology, from a simplistic conceptual framework of risk factor outcome relationships.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	96	 What is increasingly evident is that there are many potential factors operating across an entire life course (and possibly extending back into previous generations) which may influence or mediate each other's effects (Table 2).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Designing appropriate studies and systems of analysis to take into account these multiple influences and interactions is likely to provide a major challenge for future research.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	98	View this table:    Table 2 A life-course model for the aetiology of cognitive decline and dementia  .
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	99	In the meantime, what is to be done with vascular dementia? A recent editorial has suggested that, rather than tinkering with existing criteria, they should be discarded and replaced wholesale (Bowler  and  Hachinski, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Certain syndromes can be reasonably considered as diagnoses, for example dementia due to strategic infarcts or genetic disorders such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	101	 However, for the majority of vascular dementia syndromes arising in later life, although these may manifest as  pure  disorders, it is questionable whether valid distinctions can truly be drawn between sub-categories or between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	102	 The result is that clinical research diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia involve a high degree of subjective judgement (Skoog  and  Aevarsson, 2000), leading inevitably to poor agreement between raters (Lopez et al, 1994) and between different diagnostic instruments (Chui et al, 2000).
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	103	 For depression, we do not feel the need to define  life event depression  or  poor physical health depression ; rather, we direct treatment at the symptoms and, holding in mind our formulation of possible underlying causes, attempt to modify potential maintaining factors and risk factors for recurrence.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Perhaps there may be lessons to be learned for cognitive impairment and dementia.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	105	 A complex picture of overlapping and interacting pathological entities is one of the challenges and rewards of health care for older age groups that we enthuse about to students and trainees.

0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	108	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Modification of vascular risk status in mid-life is likely to be an important means of reducing the subsequent risk of dementia for a population but evidence is lacking for an effect on the course of dementia, once this has developed.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	109	 The usefulness of vascular dementia as a diagnostic category is questionable since it involves a high degree of subjective judgement, subsumes a large number of potentially heterogeneous conditions and overlaps considerably with Alzheimer's disease.
0.24103056.11823327.html.plaintext.txt	110	 The current system of classifying dementia into mutually exclusive subtypes poorly reflects mixed disease in older age groups and has become an important issue since these  diagnoses  now determine eligibility for pharmacological intervention.

0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	2	Arshad et al (2001) raise important concerns that UK guidelines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2001) may be counterproductive for patients with learning disabilities.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Potential for discrimination does not by any means stop here.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	4	 A particular difficulty they highlight is the central role of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) instrument in determining treatment  eligibility  and response.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Scores on the MMSE are strongly influenced by previous education and cross-cultural validity is poor.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The guidelines are, therefore, unhelpful for people with lower educational attainment or for growing numbers of older people from minority ethnic groups in the UK.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Comorbid cerebrovascular disease will also be more frequent in people from more disadvantaged backgrounds and, in particular, minority ethnic groups such as African Caribbean populations (Stewart et al, 1999).
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	8	 This reduces the likelihood of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (and therefore eligibility for anti-cholinesterase treatment) according to standard diagnostic criteria (McKhann et al, 1984), despite growing evidence for overlapping pathological processes in dementia (Holmes et al, 1999).
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	9	For sub-populations who are under-represented in clinical trial samples (minority ethnic groups, people with lower educational attainment, people with learning disability, people with comorbid cerebrovascular disease), the best that can be hoped for is that a considerably weaker evidence base might emerge some years in the future.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	10	 By this time large numbers of people may have failed to receive potentially beneficial treatment.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The problem does not lie with treatment guidelines themselves but with how they are applied at the level of individuals and services   in particular regarding groups with Alzheimer's disease for whom a 26-year-old cognitive screen and/or 17-year-old diagnostic criteria are unhelpful.
0.28510132.11581121.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Evidence-based medicine is a noble ideal.

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	27	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Most of the highly publicised advances in the genetics of Alzheimer's disease have concerned those very rare families with autosomal dominant forms of the disease, so-called familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) kindred, in which 50% of each generation, regardless of gender, succumb to Alzheimer's disease, usually by early mid-life (reviewed by Selkoe, 1999).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The identification of causative mutations within the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) has probably overinflated the public's perception of the role of genes in causing the far more common forms of Alzheimer's disease that do not show autosomal dominant transmission.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Yet, it is important to be able to recognise FAD because it is possible to offer such kindreds definitive genetic counselling, provided that the causative mutation can be identified.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Furthermore, a study by Campion et al (1999) suggests that FAD may occur at a frequency of around 40 per 100 000 persons at risk, which implies that there are some 600 affected individuals to be found in England and Wales, a number that suggests that a psychiatrist or neurologist will encounter an individual from a FAD pedigree at some time in their working life.

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	34	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   The function of the psychiatrist is straight-forward.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The first step is to confirm that the diagnosis is actually one of Alzheimer's disease and not one of the other, often familial, dementias such as Huntington's disease, frontal-temporal dementias, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Next, the clinician should take as detailed a family history as possible in order to try to determine whether the sufferer comes from a pedigree with autosomal dominant FAD: the occurrence of numerous individuals with early-onset disease ( < 55 years) in several generations is highly suggestive.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The presence of many affected individuals in one generation may also raise suspicion because it should not be forgotten that early death from other causes might prevent manifestation of the disorder in carriers of a disease gene.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	38	 In practice, we recommend that families containing three members with a history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease occurring before the age of 60 years should, if they request advice, be referred to a clinical geneticist.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Some forms of FAD linked to PSEN2 mutations occur after the age of 65 years, and so the psychiatrist should have a low threshold for discussing a pedigree with a clinical geneticist.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	40	Predictive or prenatal testing is potentially feasible in families with FAD but will depend upon the availability of DNA from at least one affected individual in order to establish which mutation is causing disease in that family.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	41	 It is worth stating that genetic counselling is a highly specialised area and it is strongly recommended that psychiatrists do not involve themselves without the appropriate training.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	42	The study by Campion et al (1999) analysed DNA from 34 families with FAD (obtained from all over France) for causative mutations.

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Yet another factor to consider is that there has been one report of apparent non-penetrance of a PSEN1 mutation in a healthy 68-year-old member of a FAD pedigree (Rossor et al, 1996).

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Many epidemiological studies suggest that women are at increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The reasons for this are not clear, but increased longevity compared to men, increased survival with the disease and some increase in intrinsic vulnerability probably all play a part.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	61	Prevalence studies tell us that dementia doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 years up to the age of around 85 years, after which time the rate of increase appears to slow (Heeren et al, 1991; Skoog et al, 1993; Ritchie  and  Kildea, 1995; Breitner et al, 1999; von Strauss et al, 1999).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	62	 It is likely that some of this slowing is due to very old people not living as long with their dementia as younger sufferers do, although it is also possible that survivors into late old age are relatively resistant to developing dementia (Drachman, 1994).

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	65	In fact, two nearly completely ascertained community-based studies, one from Japan and one from The Netherlands, found that the prevalence of dementia in centenarians was very high: 70% in the Japanese and 88% in the Dutch sample (Asada et al, 1996; Blansjaar et al, 2000).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Asada et al (1996) attributed some 76% of the dementia to Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that the 6-month mortality rate was 27% for the centenarians with dementia, whereas none of the non-demented centenarians died.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	67	Thus, prevalence figures for dementia tell us that many of us are at some risk of developing dementia, provided that we live long enough.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	68	 This is obviously too simplistic: most people do not expect to live into their mid-90s; a much more reasonable question is, "What is my chance of developing Alzheimer's disease by the age of 85 years?".

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	73	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   In the 1980s and early 1990s there were a number of family studies that attempted to identify the inheritance pattern of Alzheimer's disease and to quantify the risk to first-degree relatives in families with a history of Alzheimer's disease, in comparison with family members of control individuals (summarised in McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	74	 There have also been a few studies based on more representative community samples.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	75	Overall, the findings from studies based in memory clinics (that are likely to be centres of secondary referral) suggest that 30-48% of probands with Alzheimer's disease have a history of affected first-degree relatives compared with 13-19% of controls.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	76	 This translates to 6-14% of the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease having a history of Alzheimer's disease compared with 3.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	77	5-7% of the first-degree relatives of healthy controls.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Kaplan Meier life table analysis has been used in these studies to infer that the cumulative risk of dementia by age 90 varies between 30 and 50% compared with between 10 and 23% in control relatives.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	79	 However, as has been pointed out by Breitner, owing to competing causes of death, only about one-third of this theoretical familial predisposition to Alzheimer's disease is realised in the usual life span.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	80	 This translates to an actual predicted risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in the first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease of 15-19%, compared with 5% in controls (Breitner et al, 1988; Breitner, 1991).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	81	The latest systematically ascertained twin studies on the heritability of Alzheimer's disease also tend to support the estimates of familial risk derived from family studies.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Probandwise, concordance rates of about 40% and 84%, respectively, are seen in fraternal and identical twins (Bergem et al, 1997).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	83	 Because fraternal twins are genetically equivalent to ordinary first-degree relatives, the observed morbid risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is similar to that estimated for first-degree relatives in family studies.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	84	A study by Silverman et al (1994) suggested that, in large measure, the familial component of risk to the relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease was expended by the end of the ninth decade, after which time the risk was very similar to that in controls.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	85	 A number of other family history studies have suggested that familial factors are more prominent when onset is earlier (McGuffin et al, 1994).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Thus, much of Alzheimer's disease in late old age may be considered as not very familial and merely an expression of one of the ways in which the ageing process is manifested in those few survivors into late old age.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	87	The findings from these family studies can be used to advise relatives in only the broadest terms.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	88	 One can do little more than to say that, on balance, the risk to the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease who developed the disorder at any time up to the age of 85 years is increased some threefold to fourfold relative to the risk in controls.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	89	 This would seem to translate to a risk of developing Alzheimer's disease of between one in five and one in six, which, although an improvement on a risk of one in two, can still be rather frightening.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In order to put this risk into better perspective, and to help allay the client's anxiety, it may be preferable to present the risk estimates in a graphical form, as is done in Fig.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	91	 If this is done, clients can see that even at 78 years, the age of greatest risk, the actual predicted risk is only some 3% and that the cumulative risk (half the area under the curve f(x) S(x)) from age 65 to 78 is probably less than 10%.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In our experience many tell us that this is reassuring   partly because their worries were about getting Alzheimer's disease in their fifties "because this is when familial Alzheimer's disease happens" or in their sixties/seventies, thus preventing them from enjoying retirement.

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Of course, it is possible that some of the same genes that confer longevity may also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	100	 Like other disorders that reflect the combined action of several genes, the risk to relatives drops rapidly as the degree of genetic relatedness falls.

0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	165	 However, it should be borne in mind that the number of affected relatives may well depend on factors affecting longevity as well as on the degree of genetic loading for Alzheimer's disease, and it may not be advisable or possible to base discussion on risk estimates that are increased when several relatives have been affected in late old age.
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	166	 There is also preliminary evidence for substantially increased risk in the offspring of parents who both have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Bird et al, 1993).
0.4215021.11136203.html.plaintext.txt	167	 In such pedigrees, if relatives request further information, it may be worth taking a detailed family history and consulting with a clinical geneticist.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	3	 Survival and risk factors of mortality with dementia and the impact of dementia on the risk of death were investigated using the Personnes Agees Quid (PAQUID) prospective population-based cohort study between 1988 and 1998.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Statistical models dealing with interval censoring were performed.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Among 3,675 participants aged 65 years or older and initially nondemented, 2,923 have been followed up for 8 years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Of these, 281 persons with incident dementia were actively diagnosed.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	7	 The mean age of onset of dementia was 82.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	8	 In the total population, the relative risk of dying after developing dementia was estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	9	82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	18	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   As with all major public health problems, the duration of the disease is a key factor in dementia for family, practitioner, and society.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Despite the magnitude of the problem, knowledge of how serious dementia is and its consequences on the population remains imprecise.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Dementia is a major source of disability in the population (1).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Precise knowledge on survival with dementia is useful for the family and the practitioner who have to decide how to manage the patient.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	22	 For society, the survival time of persons with dementia affects the burden due to it.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Therefore, health policy decision makers need precise data on survival with dementia for health care planning.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	24	More than 100 studies have been carried out on survival with dementia, and most have found an increased risk of dying among persons with dementia compared with those without.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	25	 However, data are often not obtained from community-based studies but from selected groups, that is, institutions or clinical settings, and cannot be applied to the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Indeed, in a review of the literature, van Dijk et al.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	27	 (2) found that survival is conditioned by the reference population, with a lower survival for studies conducted in an institution than in community-based studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	28	 In addition, even among community-based studies, 2-year survival was found to vary from 37 percent to 86 percent, probably depending on study designs (2).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	29	 The majority of the studies conducted on community-based samples (3 to 11) have been based on prevalent cases, in which the onset of the disease is not known.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Onset of dementia is insidious and progressive and thus cannot be determined exactly.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Onset is often considered either as the time of the first symptoms of the disease or as the time of the first consultation.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	32	 However, the earlier one sees the patient after the onset, the more precise the estimation of the onset will be; thus, onset will be estimated more precisely in incident than in prevalent cases.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	33	Few community-based studies have used incident cases of dementia (12 to 14), and dementia cases were actively screened in only one of them (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Active detection of dementia makes it possible to take into account cases undiagnosed by their practitioner, a scenario frequent in France (15).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	35	 In such a recent study in Sweden based on the Kungsholmen project (14), the risk of death among Alzheimer's disease cases was estimated to be 2.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	36	0 compared with that of nondemented persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	37	 However, in the latter study, the onset of the disease was considered to be the time of diagnosis, and statistical analyses did not take into account the problem of interval censoring in cohort studies, where participants are not followed up continually but receive repeated cross-sectional screenings at time intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This could bias the results, particularly because of a lack of accuracy in the determination of disease onset.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	39	The aim of this paper was to evaluate survival and risk factors of mortality with dementia and to quantify the impact of dementia on total mortality, using statistical models dealing with interval censoring, on a French prospective population-based cohort with active search for incident cases of dementia at each follow-up screening.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Treated diabetes, a history of heart disease, stroke, or hypertension, and dyspnea were considered.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	54	 A variable of comorbidity was created when participants reported history of at least one of these diseases or symptoms.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Functional status was evaluated using the activities of daily living scale excluding the item of maintaining continence (18).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Participants who needed help for at least one of the five activities were classified as "disabled.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	57	After the initial interview, participants were followed up with the same baseline procedure at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years in Gironde and at 3, 5, and 8 years in Dordogne.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	58	Data on vital status were collected throughout the follow-up.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Dates and causes of death were collected from death certificates, by way of the national registry of mortality statistics.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Causes of death were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (19): cancer (codes 140 to 208 and 230 to 239); cardiovascular diseases, excluding cerebrovascular diseases (codes 390 to 427 and 440 to 455); cerebrovascular disease (codes 430 to 438); and respiratory disease (codes 460 to 511).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	61	Diagnosis of dementia At baseline, intellectual functioning was examined through a series of psychometric tests that have been shown to be among the most sensitive for assessing cognitive decline in elderly persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Then, the psychologists systematically filled in a standardized questionnaire designed to obtain the A (memory impairment), B (impairment of at least one other cognitive function), and C (interference with social or professional life) criteria for dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) (20).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	63	 In a second stage, participants who met these DSM-III-R criteria were seen by a senior neurologist, who confirmed and completed the DSM-III-R criteria for dementia and filled in the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease (21) and the Hachinski score for vascular dementia (22) to document the dementia diagnosis and its etiology: probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease, and other types of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	64	 An informant was consulted by the neurologist when available.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	65	 All ancillary information was considered, including medical charts and brain imaging, if available.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Finally, a consensus meeting allowed us to definitely classify each case.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Comparable procedures of screening of dementia are usually used in other cohort studies (23).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Diagnosis of incident dementia cases followed the same procedure at each follow-up assessment as for the baseline screening, but in order to increase the screening sensitivity, another criterion was added to qualify for the neurologic examination.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Participants were selected for this stage if they met the A, B, and C DSM-III-R criteria for dementia or if they had lost three points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination score.

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Educational level was divided in two categories: at least primary school level as validated by a diploma (the Certificat d'Etudes Primaires (CEP)) versus no diploma (24).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Analyses were performed for dementia due to all causes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	73	First, the impact of mortality with dementia on the general population was considered, comparing mortality among persons with incident dementia and those without and partitioning competing causes of death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Then, we analyzed the mortality with dementia among persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	75	 To quantify the impact of dementia on total mortality, we performed a Cox model with delayed entry, in which the time-scale is the age of the participants (25), taking the occurrence of dementia as a time-dependent variable and considering the age of onset of dementia to be at the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Relative risks of death from dementia and Alzheimer's disease were provided with 95 percent confidence intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Relative risks for competing causes of death were provided.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	78	 Mortality among persons with incident dementia, from the onset of the clinical stage until death, was analyzed using a multistate approach (semi-Markov model).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	79	 We performed a statistical model dealing with interval censoring, which is a common problem in cohort studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Indeed, in the PAQUID study, participants are not followed up continuously but with cross-sectional screenings at discrete times.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Thus, the onset of the disease is not known exactly, and the only information available is that this onset occurred between two follow-up times.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	82	 We therefore used a semi-Markov model that includes two transitions.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	83	 The first transition represents the age-specific incidence rates of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The second transition represents the mortality rates of persons with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	85	 The model uses information from the incidence data of all people in the cohort.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	86	 The fact that the time of onset of dementia is not known is taken into account by a penalized likelihood approach (26).

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	138	 The median survival with dementia was 4.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Survival was longer for women compared with men, particularly for Alzheimer's disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	140	 However, educational level did not significantly modify survival with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The relative risk of dying was estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	142	8 for persons with dementia compared with those without.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	143	 Among persons with dementia, the risks of dying from cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases were particularly increased.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	144	Studying mortality with dementia in the general population raises special difficulties.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	145	 First, one needs to conduct the study in the community, because dementia diagnosed in a hospital or in a nursing home setting is not representative of cases in the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Second, dementia should be actively screened, because it is widely underdiagnosed in the population (15, 27).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Third, it is necessary to use incident cases of dementia, for whom the disease onset is better known.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Finally, incident cases of dementia have to be followed up for a long time to observe death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Because of these methodological difficulties, few previous studies have investigated mortality with dementia in the community, by using incident cases of dementia (12 to 14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	150	 Even in these few studies, the onset of the disease was difficult to assess.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	151	 Indeed, unless participants are screened for dementia continuously, the onset of dementia is always imprecise, clearly because of an insidious onset, but also because of interval censoring between the last time when the participant was considered as dementia free and the first time he was diagnosed as having dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Thus, the onset has to be estimated, even for incident cases of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	153	 With the PAQUID study, we had the opportunity to analyze actively screened incident cases of dementia who were prospectively followed up for several years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	154	 In addition, we applied statistical models, taking into account the fact that the disease onset was not known precisely.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	155	Several methodological issues may have influenced our results.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Twenty percent of the participants in our cohort were never reevaluated; among them, a large part (55 percent) had died before the follow-up, and the others refused the follow-up examinations.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Participants who refused the follow-up examinations could be at higher risk of developing dementia; thus, nonresponse could lead to an underestimation of the incidence of dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	158	 However, this could bias the prognosis in the group of persons with dementia only if the mortality among persons with dementia who refused the follow-up differed from the mortality among persons with dementia who were evaluated, which is unlikely.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	159	Participants with a very short survival, for whom the onset of dementia occurred between two follow-ups and who died rapidly after this onset, cannot be diagnosed in our cohort and thus are not included in the survival analysis of persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	160	 As in other studies, this could overestimate the survival time with dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	161	 However, only a specific illness-death model dealing with interval censoring and taking into account these cases of dementia with a very short survival could establish to what extent survival is overestimated.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Such a model should be developed.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	163	Another methodological problem is due to difficulties in the diagnosis of dementia in some subgroups of persons, particularly very old people, persons living in an institution, and illiterate, deaf, or depressive persons.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	164	 This can lead to either a false diagnosis of dementia or a delay of diagnosis among these persons, which could bias survival among persons with incident dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	165	To demonstrate the possible bias when the problem of interval censoring is not taken into account, our results (with the three-state approach) were compared with those using standard models, that is, Kaplan-Meier curves to describe survival among incident participants with dementia and Cox models with delayed entry to analyze the effect of sex and educational level on the risk of mortality among them.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	166	 For these standard models, the onset of dementia was considered to be the middle of the interval between the last follow-up without dementia and the first follow-up with it.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Although differences between the two models were slight, the median survival after developing dementia was about 2 months longer with standard models than with the three-state approach.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	168	 The larger the interval between the two follow-up evaluations, the greater this overestimation of survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In addition, using standard models tended to increase the effect of risk factors on the mortality among persons with dementia and also to slightly underestimate confidence intervals.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	170	 This was particularly visible for the effect of sex and led to erroneous significant factors.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	171	Impact of dementia on mortality The three-state approach used to describe mortality among persons with dementia, which takes into account the fact that the time of disease onset is not known, could not be applied to evaluate the impact of dementia on mortality among the general population.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Indeed, it cannot estimate a date of onset for each participant in our cohort.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	173	 However, although the estimation of the onset of dementia is of prime importance to describe survival in dementia because it can affect the time of survival by several years (depending on the number of years between the two follow-up evaluations), this estimation is less important in the evaluation of the impact of dementia on mortality, for which the age of the participant is the time scale of the model.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	174	The relative risks of dying in our study were estimated to be 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	175	7 for Alzheimer's disease, and these decreased with age.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	176	 These results are in agreement with but are slightly lower than those found in previous community-based studies, ranging from 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	177	1 for Alzheimer's disease and from 1.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	178	0 for dementia (4 to 7, 12 to 14, 28), and even higher (RR up to 9.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	179	6) among younger participants (11, 28).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	180	 This can be explained by inclusion of incident rather than prevalent cases of dementia in our study, and by the fact that we took into account morbidity when evaluating the risk of death.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	181	Two causes of death were particularly increased among persons with dementia: cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The increase in death by cerebrovascular diseases was essentially due to vascular dementia; however, even among persons with Alzheimer's disease, there was a trend to an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases, which is concordant with the implication of vascular mechanisms in the Alzheimer pathology (29).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Death due to respiratory diseases, which has already been found to be an important cause of death among Alzheimer's persons (30, 31), was also increased in both persons with dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease, compared with those without dementia.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	184	Survival among persons with dementia As in the general population, the median duration of survival among persons with dementia was most dependent on the sex and age of participants.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	185	 The median survival times observed in our study were longer than those reported in most previous studies of prevalent cases in the community (3, 5, 7, 10) and even in some studies of incident cases (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	186	 If incident cases are considered, this leads automatically to longer survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	187	 However, clinical studies or Alzheimer Center studies have reported median survival times as long as or longer than ours (32 to 34), up to 6-year survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Several explanations may account for this longer survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	189	 First, persons referred to clinical settings for their memory are probably more interested in their health than others and may have less medical comorbidity.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Second, the treatment and management of persons with dementia who present to clinical settings could increase their survival.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Finally, the mean age of patients in clinical settings is often lower than that in community-based studies.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	192	Effect of sex on survival The protective effect of female sex observed in our study, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, is concordant with the results of several studies done with different methodologies (7, 8, 14, 33, 35 to 37).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	193	 As in the general population, women with dementia are at lower risk of mortality than are men.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	194	 Although the interaction between age and sex for the risk of dying among persons with dementia was not significant, the effect of sex seemed to decrease with age, with a greater difference between women and men at 75 years than at 85 years.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	195	 These results are concordant with those observed in the Kungsholmen project, in which sex affected survival among persons with dementia but only under 85 years (14).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Factors that explain the longer survival among women in the general population could remain unchanged during the course of the disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Trials are currently in progress to test the hypothesis that estrogen replacement therapy could affect the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	198	 However, in the PAQUID study, very few women have taken such a therapy, and this cannot explain the longer survival of women with dementia in our sample.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	199	Effect of education on survival The effect of educational level on survival with dementia was low in our study and was observed only among participants who developed dementia at the youngest age.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Previous results concerning the relation between education and mortality among persons with dementia are controversial; some authors have found an increased risk of mortality associated with a high educational level (9, 38), whereas others have not replicated these findings (10) or even found the opposite (37).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The hypothesis of brain reserve capacity, according to which development of the cerebral lesions of Alzheimer's disease at the time of diagnosis is more advanced among more highly educated people than in others, has been proposed to explain the association between high educational level and increased risk of mortality (9, 39).
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	202	 We also observed a tendency, although slight and nonsignificant, to a lower survival in persons with dementia who had the CEP but only among the youngest.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	203	 A possible bias of detecting dementia according to educational level cannot be excluded.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Indeed, participants with a low educational level have low premorbid cognitive performances and thus could be detected earlier than more highly educated participants.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	205	 However, this bias is probably reduced by taking into account not only the DSM-III-R criteria but also a loss on the Mini-Mental State Examination score in the screening procedure.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	206	Conclusion These data provide further evidence of the malignancy of dementia, which is a strong predictor of death, has a short survival time after disease onset, and has a high risk of dying associated with it.
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In the future, data on survival with dementia will make it possible to evaluate whether the development of medical and social therapies for dementia leads to an increased survival in persons with this pathology.

0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	5	It is both fashionable and necessary these days to start any presentation by declaring one's conflicts of interest.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	6	 As editors of this special supplement we therefore declare our interest in old age psychiatry.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Not so long ago cynically described as a Cinderella speciality, old age psychiatry has in the past few years become an increasingly popular clinical career choice.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Community-oriented, multi-disciplinary services that remain relatively unfettered by excessive bureaucracy would of themselves be an attractive option in a largely demoralised health care system   but there are other reasons that the speciality is thriving.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Not least are the enormous advances that have been made over the past decade in our understanding of the neurobiological basis of late-life psychiatric disorders.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Dementia, in particular, has attracted the attention of top-level neuroscientists who have applied a combination of classical neuropathology, molecular genetics and protein chemistry to reveal some of the key events underlying neurodegeneration.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	11	 As a result it is conceivable that effective treatments to delay or prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease could be available within a decade   something that was virtually unthinkable only 10 years ago.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Old age psychiatry clinicians are near enough to this buzz to feel it and be excited by it.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	13	 The differential diagnosis of dementia subtype is now an important part of assessment, the convergence of clinical descriptions of Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia (to give but two examples covered in this issue) allowing increased sophistication in terms of diagnostic reporting by clinicians.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	14	 These distinctions can lead directly to important management decisions, such as the avoidance of neuroleptic agents in Lewy body disease or the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Recognition that disorders hitherto regarded as functional in nature have an organic basis has stimulated research into uncovering aetiological factors and has again influenced clinical practice.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Furthermore, improved methods of measuring symptoms in valid and reliable ways have enabled the effects of therapeutic interventions, especially drug trials, to be assessed in ways that are sufficiently robust to allow regulatory authorities to be convinced of their worth.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	17	Our reason for presenting this series of invited papers on the subject of old age psychiatry is to inform the general reader about the major issues, challenges and successes in the speciality today.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The following contributions are not intended to be a comprehensive survey of an increasingly widening field, but have been chosen to give a flavour of the richness of clinical practice and research.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We have chosen to concentrate on descriptions of organically based syndromes, their differential diagnosis and their effects.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	20	Holmes (2002, this issue) has summarised much of the current information concerning molecular biology and Alzheimer's disease, emphasising the importance that genes can have as risk factors for the disease and stepping outside the often narrow way of thinking which tends to tunnel our vision into equating the genetics of this disease with those early-onset and rare mutations.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	21	 This is clearly a field where there is much promise in terms of treatment.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This is a theme continued by Bullock (2002, this issue) in his summary of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	23	 We now have three anticholinesterase drugs available for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease that have been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The role of these drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease will become apparent with continued clinical practice influenced by an appropriate audit of their use and benefit to patients.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Snowden et al (2002, this issue) provide an up-to-date summary of frontotemporal dementia, drawing together the clinical, neuropsychological and pathological expertise of the group, who were instrumental in the clinical descriptions of what is a relatively common, but underrecognised, cause of dementia, particularly in younger people.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Vascular dementia, which in most samples pips frontotemporal dementia to the post as one of the more common causes of the syndrome, is summarised by Stewart (2002, this issue) and the lack of clear blue water between Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia is plainly acknowledged   a problem that is increasingly influencing clinical practice as well as taxing epidemiologists.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The theme of vascular disease is continued with the review of the vascular basis of depression by Baldwin  and  O'Brien (2002, this issue).
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	28	 This condition may explain some elements of treatment resistance in practice and also has implications for the management of patients.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Subcortical dementia is summarised by Turner et al (2002, this issue), who emphasise the phenomenological aspects of dementia that have aetiological importance.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Jacoby (2002, this issue) brings to the fore many of the legal aspects of old age psychiatry which are increasingly becoming part of everyday clinical practice, particularly in relation to consent, euthanasia and mental capacity.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The interface between health and social care is highlighted by Challis  and  Hughes (2002, this issue), and the current political climate is such that this distinction   while clinically blurred in many situations   is becoming more important in administrative and financial terms.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Costs of care are an essential underpinning of considerations of clinical care, and Kavanagh  and  Knapp (2002, this issue) describe some of the models underlying many of the assumptions made by those predicting the cost of caring for people with cognitive impairment.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Our own contributions concern dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith, 2002, this issue) and the use of rating scales in old age psychiatry (Burns et al, 2002, this issue).
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	34	We hope that there is useful new information here for those practising old age psychiatry.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Two of the costs of being in a rapidly changing and expanding field are those of keeping abreast of the new information and of meeting rising public expectations of what can, should and might be done.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	36	 It is not uncommon now for patients to present themselves to one of the burgeoning number of memory clinics in the UK, asking for early diagnosis and treatment and well aware of recent guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence that the new antidementia drugs should be made available to them within the National Health Service, and the recently published National Service Framework for Older People sets out specific standards of care and aspirations for good practice across a wide range of mental health care issues.
0.23021185.11823314.html.plaintext.txt	37	 So, challenges we have in plenty.

0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	11	Aims To determine the familial (genotypic) influence on phenomenology (phenotype) in Alzheimer's disease.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	12	Method Affected sibling pairs with Alzheimer's disease were assessed for a range of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Resemblance for phenotypic characteristics was estimated using intraclass correlations for continuous traits and by pairwise concordance for dichotomous traits.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The relationship between age of onset and APOEgenotype was examined using linear regression analysis.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	15	Results Significant familial effects on age of onset (intraclass correlation 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	16	41) and mood state (intraclass correlation 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	17	26), and a relatively high pairwise concordance for agitation (excess concordance 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The APOE locus was found to account for 4% of the variance in age of onset.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	19	Conclusions Substantial familial influence on age of onset, depression and agitation suggests that genotype does influence phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Establishing the molecular basis for this phenotypic variation may prove relevant to other neuropsychiatric disorders.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	21	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHOD RESULTS DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	22	 REFERENCES   The reasons for the considerable clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease are unknown; we hypothesised that it might reflect genetic heterogeneity.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease have different ages of onset (Mullan et al, 1993), and in late-onset Alzheimer's disease variation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is associated with variation in onset age (Meyer et al, 1998).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Aphasia and apraxia have been found to be associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (Breitner  and  Folstein, 1984; Lampe et al, 1994).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Depressive symptomatology characterises some families with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Harvey et al, 1998), and a family has been reported in which Alzheimer's disease was associated with a schizophrenialike psychosis (Sumi et al, 1992).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	26	 For lateonset Alzheimer's disease, genes have been associated with psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (Holmes et al, 1998; Sweet et al, 1998).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	27	 However, no systematic study of familial resemblance for phenotypic traits has been reported previously.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	28	 We therefore conducted an affected sibling-pair phenotype study.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	29	   METHOD TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHOD RESULTS DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	30	 REFERENCES   Sample As part of a molecular genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, DNA samples and clinical data were collected on affected sibling pairs with Alzheimer's disease, ethical permission having been obtained from the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee and relevant local ethics committees.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The sample consisted of White Europeans identified by old age psychiatrists in the UK and assessed by a psychiatrist (N.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Before commencing the study, the psychiatrist and a psychologist assessed patients with Alzheimer's disease separately, and then the case was reviewed by a panel including an experienced clinician (S.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Training was conducted until all investigators reported identical assessment.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Consent/assent was established for each individual and agreement was obtained from relatives and carers.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Clinical history and current clinical state were established in a standardised manner for each individual; subjects meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al, 1984) for a diagnosis of probable or possible Alzheimer's disease were included.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	36	Clinical assessment The standardised interview schedule consisted largely of informant-based scales and batteries with established reliability; of relevance to the present report are: the CAMDEX (Roth et al, 1986), from which age of onset data were obtained; the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD; Alexopoulos et al, 1988); and the Manchester and Oxford Universities Scale for the Psychopathological Assessment of Dementia (MOUSEPAD; Allen et al, 1996).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The CSDD is a clinician-administered instrument that utilises information from interviews with both the patient and an informant.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Total CSDD scores correlate highly with depressive subtypes classified according to Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The MOUSEPAD is a 59-item instrument that measures psychopathology and behavioural changes in dementia; it has established reliability, sensitivity and validity (Allen et al, 1996).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	40	APOE genotyping Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from venous blood and APOE genotype was determined using standard methods (Wenham et al, 1991).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	41	Data analysis Phenotypic data relating to age of onset and behavioural and psychiatric signs and symptoms of dementia were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	42	 The behavioural variables were treated as separate from one another.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Support for this approach is given by a factor analysis of behavioural changes in dementia that identified three robust syndromes   overactivity, aggressive behaviour and psychosis   that were stable across time (Hope et al, 1997).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Variability in continuous phenotypic traits was partitioned into betweenand within-family variation using analysis of variance, in order to distinguish familial from non-familial sources of variation; intraclass correlations were calculated to quantify the proportion of trait variance accounted for by familial effects, and hence to estimate the strength of familial influences on these traits.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Because case-finding for this sample involved recruiting families with two or more living affected siblings, it necessarily excluded deceased affected siblings and siblings potentially at risk but currently below the age range of susceptibility for the disorder.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	46	 However, age of onset data on deceased affected siblings were included where obtainable.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	47	 For all other data points, only those clinical variables directly assessed with a living subject were utilised.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The relationship between age of onset and APOE alleles was examined using linear regression analysis.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	49	For each dichotomous trait, a pairwise concordance for its presence (the number of pairs in which both siblings are positive for the trait of interest, divided by the total number of pairs) was calculated, as was the expected value under the null hypothesis that familial effects are not operating (calculated as the square of the prevalence of the trait in question).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	50	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION METHOD RESULTS DISCUSSION Clinical Implications and.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	51	 REFERENCES   Age of onset A total of 106 affected sibling pairs with Alzheimer's disease were collected: 66% of subjects were female and 43% were living in an institutional setting at the time of sampling.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Age of onset data were obtained on 76 pairs, 19 trios and two quartets from the 106 sibships, including those relating to 10 deceased siblings.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Intraclass correlations were calculated for each of these three groups following appropriate weighting for sibship size, and a combined estimate, with upper and lower 95% confidence limits, was obtained using Fisher's z transformation as described in the Appendix.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Age of onset ranged from 46 to 91 years (mean=73.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The intraclass correlation (r) for familial influence on variation in age of onset was 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	56	62), indicating that approximately 40% of the variance in this trait is due to familial (genetic and/or shared environmental) effects.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	57	 APOE genotype data were obtained on 101 sibships; the 2, 3 and 4 allele frequencies were 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	58	 The 4 frequency is high in comparison to samples not restricted to multiplex pedigrees (a meta-analysis by Farrer et al (1997) produced a frequency estimate of 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	59	37 for Caucasians with Alzheimer's disease) and is consistent with our strategy of recruiting affected sibling pairs (or larger affected sibships), which are likely to be enriched for susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The regression coefficient for age of onset by APOE 4 gene dosage was -1.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	61	31), and by APOE 2 gene dosage was 2.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	62	49), consistent with previous reports that 4 lowers and 2 elevates the age of onset in a dose-dependent fashion.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	63	 However, the effect of APOE explained only 4% of the variance in age of onset (95% CI=0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	64	 When subjects were dichotomised into groups based on the possession or non-possession of the 4 allele, the 140 subjects identified as having an 4 allele were calculated to have a mean age of onset of 73.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	65	26 years, and the 68 subjects identified as having no allele 4 were calculated to have a mean age of onset of 76.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	66	37 years: a between-group difference of 3.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	67	10 years (t-test for equality of means: t=2.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	68	01, assuming unequal variances).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	69	Current mood state Data on current mood state (measured using position on the Cornell scale) was obtained on 86 pairs.

0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	71	Dichotomous traits For the dichotomous measures of behavioural disturbance at some point during the clinical course, data were obtained on 99 pairs.

0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	76	 REFERENCES   Familial influence on age of onset The study provides strong support for the possible role of genetic factors in determining age of onset, accounting for between a quarter and two-thirds of the variance of this trait.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This is consistent with the results of a study (Alafuzoff et al, 1994) showing a greater proportion of early age of onset in multiplex, compared with simplex, families.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	78	 The result obtained is necessarily an overestimate of the true correlation because siblings at risk but, as yet, unaffected were excluded from the sample.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	79	 A truer estimate might be obtained in the future by a study employing a population-based casefinding design with complete ascertainment.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	80	 Nonetheless, the present study goes beyond previous work in providing a quantitative estimate of familial effects on variation in this trait.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	81	 It further suggests that genes other than APOE are likely to contribute to variation in age of onset - APOE is estimated to account for between 0.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	82	5 and 11% of the variance in age at onset of Alzheimer's disease, which is comparable to a previous estimate of 10% for dementia not restricted to Alzheimer's disease (Slooter et al, 1998).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	83	 It has been argued that the role of the APOE 4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease may be mediated exclusively through modifying the age of onset; our data are compatible with a model in which other genes (either independently or in conjunction with APOE 4) also modify the age of onset rather than conferring susceptibility per se.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	84	Familial influence on mood state Evidence of significant familial effects on current mood state within Alzheimer's disease has been detected.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	85	 This finding is of considerable interest because the overrepresentation of depression in Alzheimer's disease has not hitherto been adequately explained.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Although aetiological models suggest that genetic susceptibility and recent life stressors are the major determinants of depression in adults, behavioural genetic work points to genetic influence on variation in depressive symptoms as being greater in older, compared with younger, nondemented individuals (Gatz et al, 1992).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	87	 APOE is probably a risk factor for neither late-life depression nor depression within Alzheimer's disease (Cantillon et al, 1997; Schmand et al, 1998).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	88	 However, an association between depression in Alzheimer's disease and family history of affective disorder has been reported (Pearlson et al, 1990; Lyketsos et al, 1996; Strauss  and  Ogrocki, 1996) suggesting the influence of genetic factors unrelated to susceptibility for Alzheimer's disease.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	89	Familial influence on behavioural disturbance The finding of a significantly elevated pairwise concordance for agitation suggests moderate genetic influence on this trait.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	90	 Evidence points to relative dopaminergic overactivity as a basis for agitation in Alzheimer's disease (Sweet et al, 1997).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Candidates genes for propensity to agitation in Alzheimer's disease, therefore, include those genes influencing the functioning of this system, such as the dopamine receptors, polymorphisms in which have been reported to be associated with aggression in Alzheimer's disease (Sweet et al, 1998).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	92	 In the present study, only a very modest excess concordance for the presence of aggression was detected.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	93	 The interrelationship between agitation, aggression and dopamine receptor variation warrants further study.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	94	Genotype-phenotype correlation in Alzheimer's disease may identify  psychiatric  genes The rich phenotypic variability of Alzheimer's disease cannot be explained exclusively by genetic variation but, nonetheless, this study does demonstrate that familial factors exert significant influence upon the pattern of symptoms experienced by individuals.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	95	 Given that siblings are generally exposed to very little shared environment in later life, it seems very unlikely that shared environmental factors influence familial aggregation of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	96	 It will be important to replicate this finding in other studies and to examine different traits.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	97	 Because phenotypic characteristics in Alzheimer's disease are not stable over time, it will be important to study larger sample sets over time.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	98	Determining the genes that contribute to phenotypic variability in Alzheimer's disease will be important in understanding this disorder more fully.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	99	 Behavioural disturbance is a major determinant of carer stress and an important target for therapy, and it is possible that better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of behavioural disturbance may lead to improved clinical management.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	100	 However, these findings may also have implications for other psychiatric genetic studies.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	101	 One hypothesis following from our findings is that genetic vulnerability to psychiatric disorder is revealed by neurodegeneration.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	102	 That is, some individuals may have a genetic propensity to depression, for example, but other factors protect against its development until the onset of Alzheimer's disease lowers the susceptibility threshold of these individuals.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Our study suggests that in the search for genes for depression, and possibly other psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer's disease may prove a more fertile hunting ground.

0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	112	 REFERENCES   The data consist of 76 sibling pairs, 19 trios and two quartets.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	113	 Intraclass correlations (r) are estimated for these three subsets of data in three separate analyses of variance (ANOVA).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These three estimates are then averaged to give an overall intraclass correlation, using the inverse of sampling variances as weights.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	115	 For each type of sibship, all possible sibling pairs are formed (i.
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	116	 one, three and six sibling pairs for sibships of size two, three and four, respectively).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	117	 These three sets of sibling pair data are subjected to ANOVA, to obtain three estimates of r (calculated as (MSB-MSW)/(MSB+MSW), where MSB and MSW are between- and within-pairs mean squares, respectively).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	118	 These estimates of r are subjected to Fisher's z-transformation, with the resulting normal variates having an approximate sampling variance of 1/(n-2), where n is the number of pairs (Donner, 1986).
0.23552008.10755053.html.plaintext.txt	119	 Each sibling pair contributes one independent pair, each trio contributes two independent pairs and each quartet contributes three independent pairs.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	3	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) is the chief component of the islet amyloid found in type 2 diabetes, and amylin fibril precursors may be cytotoxic to pancreatic ss-cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	4	 Little is known about the prevention of amylin aggregation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We investigated the role of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in amylin degradation, amyloid deposition, and cytotoxicity in RIN-m5F insulinoma cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Human 125I-labeled amylin degradation was inhibited by 46 and 65% with the addition of 100 nmol/l human amylin or insulin, respectively.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	7	 125I-labeled insulin degradation was inhibited with 100 nmol/l human amylin, rat amylin, and insulin (by 50, 50, and 73%, respectively).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The IDE inhibitor bacitracin inhibited amylin degradation by 78% and insulin degradation by 100%.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	9	 Amyloid staining by Congo red fluorescence was detectable at 100 nmol/l amylin and was pronounced at 1,000 nmol/l amylin treatment for 48 h.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	10	 Bacitracin treatment markedly increased staining at all amylin concentrations.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Bacitracin with amylin caused a dramatic decrease in cell viability compared with amylin alone (68 and 25%, respectively, at 10 nmol/l amylin).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In summary, RIN-m5F cells degraded both amylin and insulin through a common proteolytic pathway.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	13	 IDE inhibition by bacitracin impaired amylin degradation, increased amyloid formation, and increased amylin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting a role for IDE in amylin clearance and the prevention of amylin aggregation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	14	Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the loss of pancreatic ss-cell mass, accompanied by the presence of islet amyloid deposits in the pancreas (1).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The major component of islet amyloid is amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide), a polypeptide copackaged and cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic ss-cells (2).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	16	 It is presently unclear whether islet amyloid merely is a consequence of diabetes or actually contributes to the progression of the disease.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	17	 However, there is evidence that intermediate precursors of amylin fibrils are cytotoxic to ss-cells, whereas mature amyloid fibrils are not toxic, suggesting that ss-cell toxicity may precede deposition of islet amyloid (3,4).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Because amylin is continually produced in individuals without type 2 diabetes, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to induce amylin-induced ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Transgenic animals producing human (amyloidogenic) amylin fail to develop islet amyloid (5 to 7), but when additional diabetic traits are introduced, islet amyloid is detected (8 to 10).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Therefore, there is a protective mechanism that prevents amyloid deposition under normal conditions, but is impaired under diabetic conditions.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Because proteolysis is a major pathway in the regulation of protein levels, degradation of amylin may contribute to the prevention of islet amyloid aggregation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	22	 ss-cell toxicity and islet amyloid may therefore result from an imbalance in amylin levels because of impaired degradation of amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	23	 At present, our understanding of the proteolytic pathways that contribute to the degradation of amylin is incomplete.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	24	The enzyme responsible for the cellular proteolysis of insulin is insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (11).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The substrate specificity of IDE is for amyloidogenic polypeptides, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), glucagon, and the ss-amyloid peptide found in Alzheimer s disease, and therefore may act as a scavenger that clears amyloidogenic peptides to prevent amyloid deposition (11,12).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Recently, we showed that amylin was also an IDE substrate (13).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Therefore, IDE may be involved in controlling the levels of amylin by degradation, similar to its role in regulating the levels of the Alzheimer s-related ss-amyloid peptide (14).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Both the GK rat model of type 2 diabetes, in which IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene, and the recently described IDE-null mice show impaired glucose metabolism.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In both models, cellular insulin-degrading activity has been found to be impaired.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Therefore, it is possible that in diabetes, IDE dysfunction also results in impaired amylin degradation, increased amylin aggregation, and, eventually, islet amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The present study was performed to address the following questions: 1) Are amylin and insulin degraded in ss-cells by a common pathway? 2) Does inhibition of IDE alter amylin degradation and islet amyloid formation? and 3) Does IDE inhibition affect the cytotoxic properties of amylin toward ss-cells? To answer these questions, a pancreatic ss-cell to derived cell line was used to characterize amylin degradation.

0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	152	     DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   A pathologic feature of type 2 diabetes is the presence of islet amyloid deposits composed predominantly of amylin (1).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Whether islet amyloid is merely a marker of type 2 diabetes or actually contributes to the disease is a matter of some discussion.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Several lines of evidence suggest an association between the presence of islet amyloid and diabetes and reduced ss-cell mass.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	155	 In monkeys, the formation of islet amyloid correlates with early reduced insulin secretion and glucose intolerance, and, with time, correlates with greater deficiency in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance and ultimately hyperglycemia (22).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	156	 In humans, the degree of amyloid formation correlates with the severity of diabetes, as evidenced by the requirement for insulin replacement therapy (23,24).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Other evidence suggests that ss-cell death is caused by intermediate-sized fibrils that are precursors of islet amyloid (3,4).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	158	 In this case, islet amyloid deposits reflect an end-stage effect of amylin aggregation secondary to ss-cell death.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	159	The factors that prevent amylin fibril formation, ss-cell death, and islet amyloid deposition in the nondisease state are not understood.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Because amylin is continually produced in nondiabetic humans with no amyloid formation, the mere presence of amylin is insufficient to cause fibril formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Indeed, transgenic animals overexpressing human amylin do not form amyloid deposits (5 to 7,25), confirming that elevated amylin levels alone are insufficient for amyloid formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, when diabetic conditions are introduced, such as the ob mutation, growth hormone/steroid treatment, or a high-fat diet, these animals develop islet amyloid, islet dysfunction, reduced insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia (8 to 10).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	163	 Therefore, in type 2 diabetes, the balance shifts from amylin clearance to deposition, either by increased amounts of a factor that promotes amylin aggregation or decreased amounts of a factor that clears amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Although there have been numerous studies regarding amylin synthesis and secretion, at present there have been few studies of amylin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	165	The enzyme responsible for the intracellular degradation of insulin is IDE, a cytosolic metallothioprotease also known as insulysin (11,26).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The primary function of IDE in mammalian tissues has traditionally been thought to be the degradation of insulin, but a number of other proteins have been identified as IDE substrates, including proteins structurally related to insulin, such as proinsulin, IGF-II, and relaxin, and seemingly unrelated peptides, such as ANP and glucagon (11).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	167	 However, insulin, ANP, and glucagon all contain regions that can form ss-pleated sheets and are potentially amyloid forming (27).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	168	 It has been proposed that rather than targeting a primary sequence motif, IDE is specific toward amyloidogenic peptides (28), a concept supported by findings that IDE also degrades amylin and ss-amyloid peptide (13,29,30).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Recent studies have supported a role for IDE in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease, two conditions characterized by amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Possible genetic linkages to type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease have been mapped to the chromosomal region of the IDE gene (31 to 34).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	171	 In the GK rat, a model of type 2 diabetes, IDE has been identified as a diabetes susceptibility gene; the mutations associated with this model result in lower cellular insulin degradation, hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells, and reduced glucose uptake in vivo (35).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	172	 The recently described IDE-null mouse model displays impaired insulin and ss-amyloid degradation, as well as hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and cerebral accumulation of ss-amyloid, hallmarks of both type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer s disease (36).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Thus, the evidence is mounting that IDE plays a major role in diseases characterized by amyloid formation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	174	In a previous study using cell-free extracts (13), IDE readily degraded amylin, but with a lower affinity than for insulin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	175	 Radiolabeled amylin covalently cross-linked to IDE, and a monoclonal antibody directed against IDE immunoprecipitated both insulin- and amylin-degrading activities, confirming that IDE was the amylin-degrading protease.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	176	 We have extended those findings to a rat ss-cell to derived line.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	177	 Both amylin and insulin were degraded by RIN-m5F cells, but insulin was degraded much more slowly.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Possible reasons for this observation include differences in binding and internalization through the different receptors or differences in receptor availability (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	179	, by desensitization or cell toxicity).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The differences may also be attributed to the nature of the assay.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Unlike amylin, multiple cleavages are required to produce TCA-soluble fragments of insulin, and therefore, this assay tends to underestimate the level of insulin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Amylin degradation began quickly, then leveled off with time.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	183	 The probable explanation for this observation is based on insulin secretion by the cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	184	 The cells were changed into fresh media containing labeled substrates, so initially there was no endogenously produced insulin in the media.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	185	 RIN cells rapidly secreted insulin (reaching 5 to 10 nmol/l in 1 h), which would act as a competitive inhibitor of amylin degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Because the amylin was present in tracer amounts, sufficient insulin to competitively inhibit amylin degradation may well have been produced within 30 min.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Both insulin and amylin were capable of competitive inhibition of either substrate, with insulin in general a better competitive inhibitor than amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	188	 As discussed above, this is likely attributable to the greater affinity of insulin for IDE and possibly also to the different internalization properties for insulin and amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The efficiency of unlabeled insulin inhibition of insulin degradation was consistent with that in previous reports showing a 50% inhibition of 50 to 100 nmol/l insulin using RIN-m5F cells (37).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Taken together, the data suggest that insulin and amylin share a common pathway of degradation.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	191	The specificity of amylin- and insulin-degrading activity was investigated using the IDE inhibitor bacitracin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	192	 Although bacitracin is not a specific inhibitor of IDE, other IDE inhibitors (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	193	, N-ethylmaleimide and 1,10-phenanthroline) were highly toxic to RIN-m5F cells (R.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	194	, unpublished observations), whereas bacitracin was well tolerated by the cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	195	 Amylin and insulin degradation by RIN-m5F cells was markedly inhibited by bacitracin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Bacitracin also accelerated islet amyloid formation at all amylin concentrations, suggesting that inhibition of amylin degradation accelerates amylin aggregation and amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Because amylin has been implicated in ss-cell death, cell viability was examined under the same conditions.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Cytotoxicity induced by human amylin was markedly increased with bacitracin treatment, whereas rat amylin had no effect, suggesting that amylin degradation is responsible for reducing cell toxicity caused by amylin.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Amylin-induced cytotoxicity in ss-cells has been shown to be caused by intermediate amylin precursors rather than mature amyloid (3).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	200	 If IDE degrades amylin monomers, then the formation of both intermediate precursors and amyloid fibrils would be prevented.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The experiments performed here (48-h treatment of freshly prepared amylin) cannot determine which amylin species caused toxicity in RIN cells.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	202	 However, the degree of cell death seen with bacitracin treatment was increased to the maximum attained, even at the lowest amylin concentration, which could mean that the toxicity preceded amyloid deposition.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	203	 Although the amylin concentration required for detection of amyloid and cell toxicity (10 to 100 nmol/l) is high relative to circulating levels, the local amylin concentration around ss-cells is unknown, but may well be higher, especially under conditions that stimulate insulin and amylin secretion.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	204	In summary, RIN-m5F cells clear amylin through a bacitracin-sensitive mechanism with properties consistent with those of IDE.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Inhibition of this mechanism increased amyloid formation and cell toxicity.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	206	 These data are consistent with the emerging concept of a role for IDE in diseases characterized by amyloid.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	207	 In this regard, it is interesting to note again that transgenic animals expressing human amylin in general do not develop islet amyloid unless diabetic conditions are introduced.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	208	 One of these conditions is a high-fat diet (9).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	209	 Interestingly, it has been shown that increased lipid levels result in impaired insulin degradation (38) and free fatty acids directly inhibit IDE activity (39).
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	210	 The combination of increased expression of amyloidogenic amylin and impaired insulin-degrading activity may result in the formation of islet amyloid in these models.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	211	 Therefore, it is possible that conditions leading to impaired IDE activity (e.
0.5852807.12941771.html.plaintext.txt	212	, elevated free fatty acids) contribute to amylin accumulation and aggregation, ss-cell toxicity, islet amyloid formation, and the progression of type 2 diabetes.

0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	21	9 to 4 million persons are currently living with Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia, in the United States alone (1).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Unless an effective preventive strategy is realized, the number of dementia cases is expected to expand as the number of persons living into later decades continues to increase (2).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Advancing age, family history of dementia, educational level, and presence of the apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE) 4 allele remain the only established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (3).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	24	A mounting body of evidence supports the role of physical activity as a means to maintain cognitive performance.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Physical activity may preserve neuronal plasticity, increase synapses and dendritic receptors following injury, and release hormonal factors that may assist in neuronal creation and function (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, epinephrine) (4).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	26	 In addition, physical activity lowers cardiovascular risk, decreases blood pressure, and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and glucose tolerance (5), each of which may be related to neuronal integrity and cognitive function (6, 7).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Finally, engaging in physical activity may indicate a more enriched social environment, which may decrease dementia risk (8).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	28	Several randomized trials have reported enhanced neurocognitive function following exercise training (9).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	29	 In addition, observational studies (10 to 13) have shown an inverse association between physical activity and cognitive decline among older adults.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, an inverse association between physical activity and Alzheimer's disease has been found in some (10, 14 to 19), but not all (20 to 23), studies.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Diminished physical activity may also have different roles in the various forms of dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	32	In this study, we examined the relation of physical activity to incident dementia and its subtypes, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, by using data from a large, community-based cohort of older adults.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	33	 We also assessed the possibility that the association of physical activity with dementia may be different for APOE 4 carriers versus noncarriers.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	34	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION References   Subject selection The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a population-based, prospective cohort study initiated in 1989 to identify factors related to cardiovascular disease in older adults (24).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	35	 The target population consisted of adults aged 65 years or older residing in one of four US communities: Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Eligible persons were drawn from the Health Care Financing Administration Medicare enrollment lists by random sampling in each of three age strata (65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	37	 A total of 5,201 men and women agreed to participate in the initial recruiting phase in 1989 to 1991.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	38	 An additional 687 African Americans joined the study in 1992 to 1993 (total N = 5,888).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	39	The Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study (CHCS) (25 to 27), an ancillary study of the CHS, was started in 1992 when all CHS participants were invited to undergo cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to participate in cognitive testing.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The CHCS cohort consisted of 3,660 (66.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	41	8 percent participation rate (28)) persons for whom brain MRIs were available; 3,608 of these persons had both MRI and measures of cognition assessed at this time.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Compared with nonparticipants, CHCS participants were younger, more educated, and less likely to have cardiovascular disease (29).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	43	 The institutional review boards at each participating institution approved the research protocols for both the CHS and CHCS.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	44	 All participants provided written informed consent.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	45	Data collection Physical activity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Information on physical activity was collected by trained interviewers at CHS baseline (1989 to 1990) and at CHCS baseline (1992 to 1994).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	47	 A modified Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire (30, 31) asked participants about the frequency and duration of 15 different types of activities over the previous 2 weeks.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	48	 These activities were selected because they were previously shown to be the most common among older adults (32).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Included were walking, household chores, mowing, raking, gardening, hiking, jogging, biking, exercise cycling, dancing, aerobics, bowling, golfing, general exercise, and swimming.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	50	Activities were assigned metabolic equivalents (ml O2/minute: METs) according to intensity (30), and leisure-time energy expenditure (kilocalories/week) was estimated for each person.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Kilocalorie expenditure at CHS baseline and CHCS baseline were averaged to obtain an estimate of habitual physical activity levels in older adulthood used for the current analysis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Only a single measure of physical activity was used for participants for whom values were missing at one of the testing periods (n = 416).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	53	To express the diversity of physical activity, an activity index was calculated as the number of different activities each subject participated in over the previous 2 weeks.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Raking and mowing were collapsed into a single category to represent "yard work," resulting in a potential range for the index of 0 to 14 activities.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The activity indices from CHS baseline and CHCS baseline were averaged to represent the activity index used in the present study.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Similar aggregate scores for physical activity have been used in previous studies of dementia risk (16 to 19).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Methods for APOE genotyping in CHS have been described elsewhere (29).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples and was amplified by using polymerase chain reaction.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	59	 After cleaving and electrophoresis on agarose gels, restriction patterns were determined according to the methods of Hixson and Vernier (33).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	60	 APOE genotypes were grouped as APOE 4 carriers (2/4, 3/4, 4/4 genotypes) and noncarriers (2/2, 2/3, 3/3 genotypes).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Other measurements obtained during the CHCS baseline examination were also considered.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Sociodemographic variables included age, gender, educational level, and ethnicity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Information on smoking, alcohol intake, and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy use was self-reported.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Prevalent cases of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure at baseline were ascertained by participant self-report of a physician's diagnosis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Functional impairment was measured by using a modified version of the instrument for assessing basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living from the National Health Interview Survey (34).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Social network was assessed by using the Lubben Social Network Scale (35), and a series of questions asking participants about life satisfaction and personal relationships was summed to represent a measure of social support.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	67	 The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (36) was administered at CHCS baseline, and a more sensitive version of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) Examination (37), was administered annually.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The 3MS assesses several domains of cognition in greater detail than the Mini-Mental State Examination does, with scores ranging from 0 to 100; higher scores reflect better performance.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	69	 If a person did not receive a clinical evaluation, attempts were made to evaluate cognition by using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (38).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	70	 For participants who died between examinations, further information was obtained by using the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (39) and data concerning circumstances of death.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	71	Self-reported weight and height were also recorded at CHCS baseline.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Body mass index was calculated as weight (kilograms) per height (meters) squared.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	73	 Blood pressure was measured in a standardized manner by trained personnel after the participant had been seated for 5 minutes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	74	 The average of two readings was calculated for analysis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Hypertension was defined as a previous diagnosis of hypertension, taking hypertensive medication, or having a current systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined in fasting samples by using standard methods, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol was estimated by the Friedewald formula (40).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	77	 Persons were considered diabetic if they had a validated medical diagnosis of diabetes or a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	78	Cerebral MRIs conducted at CHCS baseline were scored for overall severity of white-matter lesions according to the scale developed by CHS researchers (41).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	79	 A white-matter-lesion severity score of  < 3 was considered within normal limits for this group of older adults, whereas a score of 3 was considered indicative of neurodegenerative changes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	80	Diagnosis of dementia Dementia status and type in CHCS were classified in 1999 to 2000 by using a multistage process (25 to 27).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	81	 Initially, participants were classified at their local study site into a dementia risk stratum (high or low).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Persons were deemed high risk if they 1) had a 3MS score of  < 80 within the last two study visits, 2) had a decline of 5 points on the 3MS within their follow-up period, 3) had a Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score of  < 28 or an Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score of  > 3.

0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	84	At the Pittsburgh site, all participants who were alive and could be traced were invited to the center in 1999 to 2000 for a full neuropsychiatric examination, regardless of dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	85	 At the three remaining sites, high-risk participants (as described above), all minority participants, and participants for whom cognitive data were incomplete were invited for a comprehensive evaluation.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	86	 For those who did not attend the clinic visit, medical records and proxy or previous telephone interviews were used for diagnosis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	87	 The diagnosis was based on a deficit in performance in two or more cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect the subjects' activities of daily living for those with a history of normal intellectual function.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	88	 The dementia criteria were designed to identify subjects with syndromes that could include relatively preserved memory functions (e.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	89	, frontotemporal dementia), and thus memory deficit was not required for the diagnosis of dementia (26).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	90	All participants identified as having dementia were reviewed by the Adjudication Committee, made up of neurology and psychiatry experts.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	91	 The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (42) criteria, and the diagnosis of vascular dementia was based on Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers criteria (43).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	92	 Time of dementia onset was established by the first diagnosis if recorded in medical records and otherwise as the midpoint between two annual CHS follow-up interviews with a marked change in cognition leading to the final dementia diagnosis.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	93	Statistical analyses Survival analysis was used to assess the association between activity level and time to onset of dementia by using Cox proportional hazards regression.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	94	 Multivariate models were adjusted for age, gender, race, APOE genotype, educational level, difficulty in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, Lubben Social Network Scale, social support, baseline 3MS score, and white-matter grade.

0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, physical activity was inversely associated with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease (10), but an inverse association with vascular dementia was observed for women only (45).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	151	 (22), however, did not observe an association of physical activity with dementia incidence once social, mental, and productive activities were accounted for, although these investigators examined only three types of physical activities and few subjects participated in these activities.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The Religious Orders Study (23) and the Bronx Aging Study (21) also failed to identify a relation between activities that were physical per se and the risk of dementia but did report an association between cognitive activity and reduced dementia incidence.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Neither of these studies accounted for APOE genotype in the analysis, however.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Although we did not measure cognitive activities directly, physical activities often occur in conjunction with social and cognitive stimulation.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	155	Physical activity may protect against dementia risk through several mechanisms.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Experimental studies have demonstrated that physical exercise activity facilitates learning, increasing the expression of genes promoting neurogenesis and neural plasticity (4, 46).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Although several neural substrates may mediate exercise-induced effects on neuronal structure and integrity, research suggests a central role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (4, 46), and levels of this factor in the hippocampi are diminished in patients with Alzheimer's disease (47).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Nonneural vascular adaptations are also enhanced with exercise, including increased cerebral blood flow and substrate exchange (48), increased cerebral capillary density (49), and decreased accumulation of radical oxidative proteins (50).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	159	In addition, physical activity may be a surrogate for overall "life engagement" and greater social activity.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Persons with more developed social networks have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than persons who are socially isolated, and social supports attenuate the rate of cognitive decline in older adults (51).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	161	 Social networks may also promote overall health, particularly cardiovascular risk factors, and thereby may impact dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Similarly, involvement in physical activities is associated with mastery and self-efficacy (52).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	163	 In turn, these attributes may motivate persons to be more attentive to health needs and health behaviors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	164	 We adjusted for social network and social support in multivariate models, however, and the activity index continued to be associated with dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	165	 If physical activity is operating through social mechanisms, it appears to be at a level not captured by these two measures of social functioning.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	166	Involvement in a number of different activities likely requires the organization and memory skills necessary to flexibly schedule, attend, and shift among activities.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	167	 Both organizational, or executive, and memory processes are regulated by neuroanatomical regions adversely affected by aging and dementing illnesses.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Exercising may help buffer or preserve cognitive reserves in the face of cognitive decline via continued use and corresponding cortical and synaptic stimulation of intact neurons (53).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	169	 In cross-sectional studies, variety of lifestyle activities has been positively associated with indices of cognition among nondemented older women, particularly in the domain of memory (M.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Carlson, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, unpublished manuscript).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	171	Alternatively, physical activity may be an index of a healthier lifestyle resulting in less exposure to factors that affect cognitive function and precipitate dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	172	 In the current study, engaging in a larger number of different activities was generally associated with a more favorable health profile and health behaviors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	173	In previous studies (54 to 56), APOE 4 carriers did not attain the same benefit as noncarriers from physical activity in terms of blood pressure and lipid patterns.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	174	 Similarly, our findings suggest differing risk patterns between dementia and physical activity by APOE genotype, and they imply that any potential protective effect associated with physical activity is not enough to overcome the effect of APOE 4 alleles, or that physical activity and dementia are simply unrelated in persons with APOE 4 genotypes.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, our findings contrast with a previous study in which an inverse association between physical activity and cognitive decline was observed predominantly in APOE 4 carriers (13).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	176	 It is difficult to know whether these findings extend to dementia; not all elderly persons who experience cognitive decline progress to clinical dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	177	 We note, however, that the interaction between physical activity and APOE 4 in this study was based on only 28 cases of cognitive decline and was thus subject to considerable variability.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	178	 Replication of these findings in larger studies will be required to resolve this apparent discrepancy.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	179	The CHCS is one of the largest prospective studies of older adults with comprehensive information on subclinical and clinical cognitive functioning, dementia status, and cardiovascular factors.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	180	 In addition, physical activity was collected by using standardized methods (29), and the prospective design of CHCS enabled us to collect information on physical activity in advance of dementia diagnosis, therefore minimizing selection and recall biases.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	181	We did not update the information on physical activity over follow-up because preclinical symptoms may reduce activity levels, compromising the ability to establish temporality.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Although misclassification of exposure is possible, all participants in the present analysis were cognitively stable (3MS score  > 80) at the time that physical activity information was collected.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	183	 Furthermore, we were able to adjust for baseline 3MS cognitive scores in our analyses.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	184	 On the basis of these considerations, it is reasonable to suggest that misclassification of exposure would have been nondifferential and would have biased our results toward the null.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	185	Our findings are not without limitations.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	186	 We were able to assess physical activity levels during older adult life only, but it is unclear during what period of life physical activity is most relevant to preserving cognition and impacting dementia risk.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Our finding that number of activities has a stronger association with dementia risk than does kilocalorie expenditure may be an artifact of measurement.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Reliability of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire may be lower at low-to-moderate levels of activity (57), levels at which most older adults participate.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	189	 It is therefore possible that number of activities may be a more sensitive indicator at these levels.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Furthermore, persons with established physical activity habits may be more precise in their recall than persons who exercise sporadically.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	191	 Similarly, recall of number of activities may be more reliable than specifics about exercise frequency and duration, both factors heavily weighted in calculating total energy expenditure.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	192	 In this sample, number of activities was significantly and positively correlated with total physical activity energy expenditure.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Understanding which components of physical activity reduce dementia risk deserves further attention.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	194	We must also consider the possibility that a reduction in the number of different physical activities is an early symptom of dementia.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	195	 We addressed this possibility by using several different approaches.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	196	 First, we excluded all persons with a 3MS score of less than 80 or with prevalent dementia at baseline.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	197	 However, it is possible that the 3MS is not sensitive enough to detect persons with subclinical dementing illness and that some of these persons were included in our study.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	198	 Second, we adjusted our analyses for baseline cognitive function, and the inverse association of number of physical activities with dementia risk persisted.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	199	 Third, we reran the analysis by excluding persons who developed incident dementia within the first year of the follow-up, and the results were essentially unchanged.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Furthermore, we used information on physical activity from two time points approximately 5 years apart to obtain a more stable estimate of regular physical activity in older adulthood prior to dementia onset.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	201	 Finally, we also evaluated the association of physical activity with dementia risk after excluding persons who had one or more difficulties in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living; again, the results were similar.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	202	In summary, this study provides support for the hypothesis that engaging in a number of different physical activities protects against subsequent risk of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia over an average 5.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	203	4-year follow-up, although the potential benefits of exercise may be limited to APOE 4 noncarriers.
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	204	 Physical activity is already recommended to enhance cardiovascular health and help maintain independence and quality of life in older adults (52).
0.29024228.15781953.html.plaintext.txt	205	 Confirmation of these findings and substantiation of the biologic mechanism by which activity reduces dementia risk may provide an additional impetus for persons to remain or become active in a number of activities in later life.

0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	8	 Whether insulin alters peroxisomal oxidation has not been studied.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We present data which show that insulin inhibits the oxidation of palmitic acid by peroxisomes (IC50 = 8.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	10	5 x 10-11 M) at hormone concentrations 100-fold less than those needed for mitochondrial inhibition (IC50 = 1.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	11	 We used a purified peroxisome preparation to study the mechanism of insulin action.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Insulin had a direct effect in the peroxisome preparations to decrease oxygen consumption, fatty acyl-CoA oxidizing system activity and acyl-CoA oxidase by approximately 40%, 30% and 15%, respectively.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Since insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is an insulin-binding protein known to be in peroxisomes, we studied the effect of an inhibitory anti-IDE antibody on the ability of insulin to inhibit the fatty acyl-CoA oxidizing system.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The antibody eliminated the inhibitory effect of insulin.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	15	 We conclude that insulin inhibits peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation by a mechanism requiring IDE.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	16	   Introduction Top Abstract Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References   TYPE 2 DIABETES mellitus is no longer seen as simply a disease of carbohydrate metabolism (1, 2).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	17	 Lipid metabolism, especially that of FFA, plays an important role (1, 3, 4).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The interaction of FFA and glucose metabolism was first noted by Randle s group in the 1960s (5), in what is called the glucose-fatty acid cycle.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Essentially, increased availability of one substrate would suppress oxidation of the other.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Increased FFA oxidation results in increased acetyl CoA and citrate, which inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase 1, respectively.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	21	 More recent studies have confirmed that increased FFAs cause more lipid oxidation and less carbohydrate utilization (6, 7, 8, 9).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Thus, insulin control of FFA metabolism may be a critical factor in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	23	Insulin decreases fatty acid oxidation, in part, by decreasing triglyceride breakdown, and thereby reducing substrate availability.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	24	 Insulin also has direct effects on fatty acid oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	25	 Fatty acids are metabolized in mitochondria and peroxisomes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Long chain fatty acids require coupling to carnitine for transport into the organelle s matrix before oxidation (10, 11, 12).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	27	 This coupling is catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I (CPT I).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Malonyl-CoA, a by-product of glucose metabolism, is a potent inhibitor of CPT I (13).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Insulin s ability to decrease mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is thought to be mediated by this mechanism.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	30	 However, much less is known about the mechanism whereby insulin reduces peroxisomal oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	31	Peroxisomes oxidize a variety of lipids through ss-oxidation, including medium, long-chain, and very long-chain fatty acids, branched fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids, prostaglandins, and some bile acids (14).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Normally peroxisomal ss-oxidation of fatty acids is preferential for very long-chain fatty acids ( > C20), although oxidation of shorter chains occurs.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Peroxisomal ss-oxidation has many similarities to the analogous mitochondrial process (14), but peroxisomal ss-oxidation is not coupled to the electron transport chain.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Instead, the by-products are heat, FADH2, and H2O2.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	35	 We have examined insulin s effect on peroxisomal FA oxidation in isolated hepatocytes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Further, we have done studies on isolated peroxisomes to explore the mechanism of the insulin effect.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Our results indicate that peroxisomal FA oxidation is controlled by insulin in a manner different from mitochondria FA oxidation.

0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Although attention has focused on glucose turnover, the primary metabolic derangement associated with type 2 diabetes may pertain as much to alterations in lipid metabolism as to glucose control (1, 2, 29, 30).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	129	 One effect of insulin is to decrease fatty acid oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	130	 It does this in part by decreasing triglyceride breakdown, thereby decreasing substrate availability and increasing glucose metabolism.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	131	 The increased glucose metabolism results in an increase in malonyl CoA, an inhibitor of CPT I, which is required for long chain fatty acid oxidation by mitochondria (10, 11, 12, 13).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	132	 However, long and especially very long chain fatty acids are also metabolized by peroxisomes (14).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Our results show that peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation is inhibited at a much lower insulin concentration than is mitochondrial oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	134	 This suggests a different mechanism for control of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	135	The oxidation of octanoic acid does not require the action of CPT I for its transport into the matrix.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In our studies octanoic acid metabolism was unaffected by insulin.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Thus, mitochondrial function per se was not altered by insulin.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Palmitate oxidation, however, was affected in both mitochondria and peroxisomes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Peroxisomal oxidation was much more sensitive to insulin, by a factor of 150, indicating that it was not working by the same mechanism in the two different organelles.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The mitochondrial inhibition was probably primarily mediated by malonyl CoA inhibition of CPT I.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	141	 Arachidonic acid metabolism was affected by insulin, but the effect was primarily on mitochondrial oxidation with a smaller effect on peroxisomal oxidation, and with different IC50s than for palmitate.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	142	Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) has a type-1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (31, 32, 33), and some data suggest that it may be concentrated in these organelles (34).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	143	 2) demonstrates its presence in our preparations.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	144	 Furthermore, our data show IDE has a role in modulating peroxisomal enzyme activity.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Insulin incubated with purified peroxisomes inhibited fatty oxidation and lowered O2 consumption.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	146	 An inhibitory anti-IDE antibody abolished the insulin effect.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	147	 Thus, enzymatically active IDE is required for the effect.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Whether the enzyme is involved directly or whether insulin degradation products are required is still to be determined.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	149	 However, this function of IDE is similar to one we have described for its interaction with the proteasome (27, 28, 35, 36, 37).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In that system, insulin, binding to IDE, inhibited two peptidolytic activities of the proteasome.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	151	 This results in a typical insulin action, a decrease in cellular protein degradation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	152	 A similar situation is found with IDE and interactions with the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors (38, 39).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	153	 In the current system, another typical insulin action, decreased fatty acid oxidation, is also achieved by insulin interacting with IDE in association with a subcellular organelle.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	154	 We propose that IDE mediates these effects of insulin, acting as an intracellular receptor for the hormone.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This idea is especially interesting in light of the recent identification of IDE as a candidate susceptibility gene in GK rats, a model of type 2 diabetes (40).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, but since insulin and the anti-IDE antibodies have effects in permeabilized peroxisomes, IDE apparently does not work by altering fatty acid transport into peroxisomes, but rather has a more direct action.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	157	Fatty acids or their acyl-CoA thioesters are known to be ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and other transcription factors and to alter gene expression (41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Fatty acids or their acyl-CoA thioesters are also known to alter a number of enzyme activities, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, tricarboxylate carrier, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP) (47, 48).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	159	 Thus, hormonal control of peroxisomal activity and the subsequent changes in the levels of fatty acids could result in significant alteration in cellular metabolism both short-term (enzyme activity) and long term (gene transcription).
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Insulin s action in peroxisomes at relatively lower concentrations may be directed at altering the relative composition of available intracellular FFA, rather than altering total cellular fatty acid oxidation.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	161	 These changes in fatty acid composition would work as another signal transduction mechanism of insulin, and one where dietary status could directly affect insulin action.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	162	 While highly speculative, excessive dietary fatty acids would increase intracellular fatty acid levels and alter their relative composition, overwhelming this subtle control by insulin.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	163	 These changes could contribute to insulin resistance by altering normal fatty acid-mediated control of the PPARs.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	164	 The thiazolidinediones may act to reverse these changes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	165	In summary, insulin decreases fatty acid oxidation in peroxisomes.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This action requires insulin degrading enzyme and thus uses a mechanism distinct from the one that decreases fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria in response to insulin; malonyl CoA inhibition of CPT I.
0.2693785.11356722.html.plaintext.txt	167	 While the effect of insulin in peroxisomes on total fatty acid oxidation by the cell is relatively minor, the resulting change in the fatty acid composition available for metabolism and regulatory control would provide an additional mechanism for insulin-directed regulation of cellular activities.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	6	 The authors performed a meta-analysis of 14 studies (16 comparisons) with CTSD genotyping (3,174 Alzheimer s disease cases and 3,298 controls).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Overall, the random effects odds ratio for the T versus the C allele was 1.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	11	 The summary odds ratio for T carriers versus T noncarriers was similar in subjects carrying or not carrying an apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The increased susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4 carriage tended to be more prominent in the presence of the T allele (random effects OR = 6.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	14	 The meta-analysis shows that the CTSD polymorphism is not a major risk factor for Alzheimer s disease, although a small effect or an enhancement of the APOE*4 effect cannot be excluded.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	19	 The cathepsin D gene (CTSD) is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	20	 The synthesis of beta-amyloid peptide is a putative key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	21	 Beta-amyloid derives from its precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by secretases.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	22	 Therefore, it has been postulated that variants in the genes coding for enzymes involved in the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or in the degradation and clearance of beta-amyloid from the central nervous system may be potential risk factors for Alzheimer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	23	   GENE VARIANTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   The CTSD gene contains a polymorphic C-to-T transition site at position 224 in exon 2.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This polymorphism results in an Ala38-to-Val substitution in the cathepsin D profragment (3).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The polymorphism has been associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of the cathep-sin D profragment in one study (3).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Moreover, the T allele has been associated with a 50 percent decrease in beta-amyloid peptide 1 to 42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer s disease (4).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Finally, this polymorphism was recently reported to be significantly associated with general intelligence in healthy elderly people (5).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	28	Molecular epidemiologic studies have presented seemingly contradictory results concerning a potential role of CTSD polymorphism in Alzheimer s disease (6 to 19).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	29	 There is also controversy on whether this polymorphism may interact with the apolipoprotein E 4 allele (APOE*4), which is the best known genetic determinant for sporadic Alzhei-mer s disease (20).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Single studies may have been underpowered to detect interactions or even overall effects.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Given the amount of accumulated data, we deemed it important to perform a quantitative synthesis of the evidence using rigorous methods.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Thus, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of all available studies relating the CTSD polymorphism to the risk of Alzheimer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	33	   DISEASE TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION GENE GENE VARIANTS DISEASE META-ANALYSIS METHODS META-ANALYSIS RESULTS DISCUSSION LABORATORY TESTS POPULATION TESTING REFERENCES   Alzheimer s disease is the most common cause of progressive cognitive impairment in the elderly, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 percent at 65 to 69 years increasing up to 40 percent in the very elderly ( > 85 years of age) (21, 22).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 genes account for 5 percent of the cases and result in an autosomally dominant pattern that is expressed with complete penetrance and early manifestations (23).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Alzheimer s disease is probably slightly more common in females (24).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Other proven or postulated risk factors include head injury (in particular among males) (25), as well as family history, low income, low education, low occupational status, depression, exposure to aluminum in drinking water, hypertension, and Down s syndrome (26, 27).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	37	 Conversely, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to treat arthritis has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzhei-mer s disease, as has been estrogen use by postmenopausal women (27).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	38	 Physical activity, diets with high levels of vitamins B6, B12, and folate, and red wine in moderate quantities may be protective (27).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The prevalence of Alzheimer s disease varies considerably among different population groups (28).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	40	 At least a few dozens of polymorphisms have been examined in relation to sporadic Alzheimer s disease, and published reviews are available (23, 29).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Among them, there is conclusive evidence from several studies and meta-analysis thereof that APOE*4 is a strong risk factor for developing Alzheimer s disease for both male and female subjects and for both early onset ( < 65 years) and late-onset disease (20), with an approximately fivefold increase in the odds of developing Alzheimer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	42	 Single studies have also implicated other polymorphisms as being important, although the reported odds ratios are much smaller than those seen for APOE*4, and attempts at replication in subsequent research have not been conclusive.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	43	 Meta-analyses for some other polymorphisms have already appeared in the literature (30 to 35).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	44	 They suggest no significant overall associations for several of these polymorphisms, including the myeloperoxidase gene promoter polymorphism (30), intronic or promoter region polymorphisms of presenilin 1 (for late-onset disease) (31), an insertion-deletion polymorphism or a missense mutation in the alpha-2 macroglobulin gene (32), and several polymorphisms of the protein tau gene (33).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Associations of modest effect size (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	46	35) have been claimed in meta-analyses of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene exon 3 polymorphism (34) and of an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme I gene (35).

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	51	Case-control studies were eligible if they had determined the distribution of CTSD genotypes in Alzheimer s disease cases (regardless of age of onset) and in a concurrent control group of dementia-free subjects using a molecular method for genotyping.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	52	 Cases with Alzheimer s disease were eligible regardless of whether they had a family history of Alzhei-mer s disease or not.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	53	 However, we excluded family-based studies of pedigrees with several affected cases per family, because their analysis is based on linkage considerations.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	54	Data extraction Two investigators independently extracted data and reached consensus on all items.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The following information was sought from each report: authors, journal and year of publication, country of origin, selection and characteristics of Alzheimer s disease cases and controls, demographics, ethnic group of the study population, eligible and genotyped cases and controls, and number of cases and controls for each CTSD genotype.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	56	 For studies including subjects of different ethnic groups, data were extracted separately for each ethnicity, whenever possible.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Furthermore, we examined whether matching had been used, whether there was specific mention of blinding of the personnel who performed the genotyping to the clinical status of the subjects, and whether the genotyping method had been validated.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	58	Meta-analysis The primary analysis compared Alzheimer s disease cases with controls for the contrast of T versus C alleles.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	59	 This analysis aims to detect overall differences.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	60	 We also examined the contrast of extremes (homozygotes), T/T versus C/C.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	61	 Finally, we examined the contrast of T/T versus (C/T + C/C) and the contrast of (C/T + T/T) versus C/C.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	62	 These contrasts correspond to the recessive and dominant effects, respectively, of the T allele.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	63	The odds ratio was used as the metric of choice.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	64	 For each genetic contrast, we estimated the between-study heterogeneity across all eligible comparisons using the chi-square-based Q statistic (36).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Heterogeneity was considered significant for p  <  0.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Data were combined using both fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) models (37).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Random effects incorporate an estimate of the between-study variance and tend to provide wider confidence intervals, when the results of the constituent studies differ among themselves.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	68	 In the absence of between-study heterogeneity, the two methods provide identical results.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Random effects are more appropriate when heterogeneity is present (37).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	70	We also performed cumulative meta-analysis (38) and recursive cumulative meta-analysis (39, 40) to evaluate whether the summary odds ratio for the T versus C contrast changed over time as more data accumulated and whether the strength of the association changed when the first hypothesis-generating study was excluded from the calculations (41).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Inverted funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar publication bias diagnostic (nonparametric correlation coefficient) (42) evaluated whether the magnitude of the observed association was related to the variance of each study, that is, whether large studies gave different results compared with smaller ones (43).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	72	 Finally, we evaluated whether the summary results were different when the analysis was limited to studies with more intensive efforts to exclude Alzheimer s disease from controls (those that clearly performed neuropsychological testing for all controls).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	73	Previous investigations have alluded to the possibility that the T allele may interact with the APOE*4 allele in conferring susceptibility to Alzheimer s disease (7, 9).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	74	 Thus, we also evaluated the effect of T allele carriage on the risk of Alzheimer s disease separately for APOE*4-positive and APOE*4-negative subjects.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	75	 Moreover, we evaluated the genetic effect conferred by the presence of APOE*4 separately in subjects carrying the T allele and those not carrying the T allele.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	76	 Odds ratios were combined with fixed and random effects models, as described above.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	77	 When these data were not reported, we communicated with the primary investigators to obtain this information, whenever possible.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	88	 One study (6) mentioned that 61 percent of Alzheimer s disease cases had late-onset disease (age of onset:  > 65 years), five studies (8, 12 to 14, 19) specifically included only late-onset Alzheimer s disease cases, one study (18) specifically excluded such patients, and the remaining did not clarify the age at onset.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	89	 Controls did not have a diagnosis of Alzheimer s disease, but the amount of additional screening (general physical and neurologic examination, psychiatric interview, neuropsychological testing, blood and cerebrospinal fluid studies, computed tomography scan, and Mini-Mental State Examination score) to exclude Alzheimer s disease differed substantially across studies.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The current evidence cannot exclude that the T allele of the CTSD polymorphism may increase modestly the risk of Alzheimer s disease, but there was significant heterogeneity in the results of various studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	157	 However, we found that bias might exist, with a decreasing effect size, as more data accumulated over time.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Moreover, the meta-analysis also cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the CTSD T allele may enhance the increased susceptibility toward Alzheimer s disease conferred by APOE*4.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	159	 However, even if this is true, it would pertain to the relatively small group of subjects who carry both the APOE*4 and CTSD T alleles.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	160	 In all, the impact of the T allele on a population level would be small, if present at all.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	161	The meta-analysis findings may be interpreted against the postulated biologic context of the CTSD polymorphism.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Cathepsin D is an intracellular acid protease with beta-secretase activity in vitro (1, 2) that can cleave amyloid precursor protein and the tau protein to generate fragments with intact microtubule-binding domains (44), which might play a role in the pathogenesis of paired helical filaments.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	163	 One study has shown that the CTSD polymorphism is associated with increased secretion and altered intracellular maturation of procathepsin D (3).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	164	 It should be noted that it is not clear whether the CTSD polymorphism has functional consequences for the mature form of the enzyme.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Although we cannot exclude a biologic effect for the CTSD polymorphism, our findings are in accordance with the results of a recent full genome scan showing no significant linkage of Alzheimer s disease to the short arm of chromosome 11, the region where the CTSD gene is located (45 to 47).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	166	Attention should be given to the design of individual studies.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	167	 The results of meta-analyses may be affected by methodological problems and potential biases in the designs of the constituent studies.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	170	 However, some young control subjects may have developed Alzheimer s disease at older ages.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	171	 The choice of an appropriate age window for assessing a postulated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer s disease is difficult.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	172	 Studies of younger subjects may be more suitable for identifying risk factors that result in early onset Alzhei-mer s disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	173	 Conversely, selection of younger subjects may be less appropriate, if the influence of the postulated genetic risk factor is more important in late-onset Alzhei-mer s disease.

0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	179	 Interactions with other genetic or environmental factors have not been studied.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The trend for a stronger effect of APOE*4 in the presence of T allele carriage is interesting in the light of data suggesting that T carriage may affect the general intelligence (5).
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	181	 However, subgroup and interaction analyses should be interpreted cautiously, since differences between subgroups may occur by chance (49) and their validation would require studies with even larger sample sizes than the several thousand included in this meta-analysis.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Finally, population stratification may theoretically have affected the results of the constituent studies in the meta-analysis (50), since we documented that the frequency of the T allele varied considerably among the different ethnic groups or even among the different ethnic groups of European descent.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, most studies were strictly ethnically defined, so the population stratification effect is unlikely to have been of any considerable magnitude.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	184	Because of the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer s disease worldwide, it is crucial to identify genetic risk factors for this neurodegenerative disease.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	185	 Thus, the list of identified polymorphisms that may influence the risk of Alzheimer s disease is continuously expanding (23, 29), but most of the reported associations of candidate genes to date remain nonreplicated or at least controversial after subsequent investigation.
0.2710359.15003956.html.plaintext.txt	186	 Early and small genetic association studies may come up with spurious findings (41, 51, 52).

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	4	   ABSTRACT TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Genetic analysis of the diabetic GK rat has revealed several diabetes susceptibility loci.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Congenic strains have been established for the major diabetes locus, Niddm1, by transfer of GK alleles onto the genome of the normoglycemic F344 rat.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Niddm1 was dissected into two subloci, physically separated in the congenic strains Niddm1b and Niddm1i, each with at least one disease susceptibility gene.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Here we have mapped Niddm1b to 1 cM by genetic and pathophysiological characterization of new congenic substrains for the locus.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	8	 The gene encoding insulin-degrading enzyme (Ide) was located to this 1 cM region, and the two amino acid substitutions (H18R and A890V) identified in the GK allele reduced insulin-degrading activity by 31% in transfected cells.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	9	 However, when the H18R and A890V variants were studied separately, no effects were observed, demonstrating a synergistic effect of the two variants on insulin degradation.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	10	 No effect on insulin degradation was observed in cell lysates, indicating that the effect is coupled to receptor-mediated internalization of insulin.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Congenic rats with the Ide GK allele displayed post-prandial hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells, blunted insulin-stimulated glucose transmembrane uptake and reduced insulin degradation in isolated muscle.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	12	 Analysis of additional rat strains demonstrated that the dysfunctional Ide allele was unique to GK.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	13	 These data point to an important role for Ide in the diabetic phenotype in GK.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	14	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), is an accelerating health burden in urbanized societies with aging populations.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	15	 The disease is associated with physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	16	 A continuously increasing number of people worldwide are affected and are therefore at risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, vision defects and neurological problems.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	17	It is generally considered that the disease in most cases results from a combination of impaired insulin action in target tissues and a reduced capacity to secrete insulin from the pancreatic B cells.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The etiology is multifactorial with an appreciable genetic basis, although environmental factors are also of critical importance for the development of overt disease (1 to 6).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	19	 In the vast majority of type 2 diabetes patients, the genetic basis and the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the disease are still unclear.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	20	 Genetic dissection of type 2 diabetes in humans is compromised by genetic heterogeneity, multigenicity and environmental variation.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	21	 However, mutations in several genes linked to monogenic forms of type 2 diabetes have been identified in recent years (7 to 12).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	22	One way to circumvent the complexity in the human population is to genetically dissect well-defined animal models of multifactorial diseases.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Such dissections of rat and mouse models for the metabolic syndrome have successfully revealed loci for glucose intolerance and diabetes (13 to 20).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	24	 The inbred GK rat is an extensively studied model of type 2 diabetes that displays the key features of the disease, such as defects in both insulin action and secretion as well as late complications (21,22).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The genetic analysis of the GK rat revealed several loci for diabetes-associated phenotypes (13,14).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We identified three genome-wide significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) (Niddm1, Niddm2 and Niddm3) affecting glucose homeostasis, one locus controlling body weight (Weight1) and an additional 10 loci with less significant influences on diabetes-associated phenotypes (13).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	27	 The major QTL, Niddm1, located on chromosome 1, explained 31% of the genetic variation of post-prandial glycemia and influenced insulin levels and body weight.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The Niddm1 locus has been dissected further by analysis of congenic strains established by transferring Niddm1 GK alleles onto the genome of the normoglycemic F344 rat (23).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	29	 This made possible the dissection of Niddm1 into two genetic entities defined by the two non-overlapping congenic strains Niddm1b and Niddm1i, each displaying a distinct diabetic phenotype.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	30	Here we describe the submapping of the Niddm1b locus to a small genetic region of 1 cM defined by new congenic strains.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	31	 The gene encoding insulin-degrading enzyme (Ide) was mapped within this region, and a GK-specific allelic variant of Ide was identified.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	32	 Furthermore, in vitro expression analysis showed reduced insulin degradation by the GK variant, and isolated muscle from a congenic strain with the Ide GK allele demonstrated decreased insulin degradation and blunted insulin-stimulated glucose transport.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	33	   RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES   Analysis of diabetes-related phenotypes in Niddm1b substrains Substrains of Niddm1b were established as described in Materials and Methods.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Since an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was used to identify Niddm1 as well as to define the Niddm1b and Niddm1i subloci, the same test was applied to characterize the new congenic sublines for Niddm1b (Fig.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	35	 To map the susceptibility gene within Niddm1b, male rats from the congenic strains (Niddm1e, Niddm1f and Niddm1c) were subjected to an IPGTT at 95 days of age with F344 as control.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Similarly to Niddm1b (23), post-prandial glucose levels in both Niddm1e and Niddm1f were significantly higher compared with F344 (Table 1).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The most pronounced difference was observed at 30 min after glucose injection, when the glucose levels were 21% higher in both Niddm1e and Niddm1f.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The basal and 30 min insulin levels were also significantly higher than in F344.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The glucose and insulin values in Niddm1c were almost indistinguishable from those in F344, and therefore the differences between Niddm1c and Niddm1e or Niddm1f will be the same as between F344 and Niddm1e or Niddm1f.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The congenic strains exhibiting a diabetic phenotype at 95 days (Niddm1e and Niddm1f) and F344 control rats were treated with high fat diet from age 120 days and were subjected to an IPGTT at 225 days of age.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	128	 Similarly to the parental Niddm1b strain, Niddm1e displayed elevated post-prandial glucose levels, impaired basal and insulin-induced lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes, increased body weight, excess epididymal fat mass and elevated fasting and post-prandial insulin concentrations (Tables 1 and 2).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	129	 To challenge further the metabolism of the animals and to investigate the effects of high fat diet and age on the development of the diabetic phenotype, old rats (225 days) were subjected to an IPGTT after 3.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	131	 At this age, F344 control rats also showed signs of impaired glucose tolerance.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	132	 The post-prandial glucose levels in F344 were distinctly higher than at 95 days, and glucose levels were not normalized 90 min after glucose injection, as at 95 days.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	133	 This effect was even more pronounced in the congenic strains (Niddm1e and Niddm1f) that exhibited the most significant difference compared with F344 at the 90 min time point.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	134	 We conclude that increasing age and high fat diet significantly aggravated the diabetes-associated phenotypes in Niddm1e compared with F344, demonstrating that Niddm1e carries a diabetes susceptibility gene.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	135	 As in the parental Niddm1b strain, the phenotype of Niddm1e indicated that the primary defect is in insulin action rather than in insulin secretion.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	136	 In addition to high blood glucose levels, Niddm1e rats showed both reduced glucose incorporation into lipids in isolated adipocytes (Fig.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Also, the basal in vivo hyperinsulinemia at 95 and 225 days indicated insulin resistance (Tables 1 and 2).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	139	 At 95 days of age, the insulin levels at 30 min were elevated in Niddm1e compared with F344, indicating a compensatory insulin secretion at the prevailing insulin resistance.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	144	 IDE is a Zn2+-requiring metalloproteinase with a distinct Zn2+-binding site (24,25), and it is widely expressed throughout the body (26).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Several studies support IDE as part of the primary enzymatic mechanism for initiating cellular insulin processing and degradation; it is likely that IDE has an important regulatory role in insulin action (27).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	146	 On binding to its receptor, insulin is internalized into endosomes where insulin degradation is initiated by IDE (28).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	147	 After dissociation, the insulin receptor is recycled to the plasma membrane.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	148	 Apart from endosomes, IDE is also present in the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm and in peroxisomes.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Several additional peptides interact with IDE, e.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	150	 glucagon, ANP, transforming growth factor- and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II bind and are readily degraded.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	151	 In addition, proinsulin, IGF-I and epidermal growth factor bind, but are poorly degraded by IDE (27).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	152	 IDE may also be involved in other types of cellular proteolysis and interacts with the proteasome, the major site for intracellular protein degradation (29).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Furthermore, IDE may have a regulatory role in steroid action and interacts with the receptors for glucocorticoid and androgen (30).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	154	The Ide cDNA was sequenced in GK and F344, in search of structural differences in the encoded protein that could mediate the diabetic phenotype in Niddm1e.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	155	 Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified; two of these resulted in amino acid substitutions (H18R and A890V), whereas the third was silent (codon 934).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	156	 The Ide cDNA was sequenced in 11 additional rat strains to investigate the prevalence of the identified variants.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	157	 A890V was unique for GK, whereas H18R and the variant at codon 934 were also present in other strains, supporting the argument that the A890V variant influences the diabetic phenotype in Niddm1e (Table 3).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Furthermore, A890 is conserved in Ide from rat, human and Drosophila, suggesting that this residue is important for enzymatic activity.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The substitutions are not in residues that have been shown to be necessary for Zn binding or for catalytic activity (31).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, the residues important for ligand binding are still unknown.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	161	In vitro expression of IDE revealed that the GK allele had a 31% reduced ability to degrade insulin in living cells.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	162	 However, when the H18R and A890V variants were studied separately, no significant effects were observed (Fig.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	163	 This indicates that the two variants are interacting (synergism) to mediate the effect on insulin degradation.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	164	 No effects of the GK variants on insulin degradation were observed in cell lysates of Ide-transfected COS cells, suggesting that the defect in IDE is coupled to receptor-mediated internalization of insulin or other activities that require intact cell structures.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	165	These data suggest that Ide is one of the genes contributing to the diabetes phenotype in GK rats and mediates the hyperglycemia and insulin resistance observed in Niddm1e, possibly through an impaired insulin-degrading capacity.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	166	 This is supported by both genetic and pathophysiological data: (i) Niddm1g overlaps the major part of the GK region in Niddm1e except for 1 cM that includes Ide; (ii) the normoglycemic Niddm1g strain displayed post-prandial glucose levels indistinguishable from those observed in the F344 control rat (Fig.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	167	 4); and (iii) the insulin-induced glucose transport is severely reduced in muscle from Niddm1e together with a 21% reduced ability to degrade insulin (Fig.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	168	 These phenotypes were not observed in the congenic strain Niddm1g, which carries F344 alleles of Ide.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	169	 Thus, the diabetes susceptibility locus is restricted to the 1 cM region that encompasses Ide, and which encodes several phenotypes related to IDE action, most conspicuously the reduced insulin-stimulated transmembrane transport of glucose in muscle.

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	172	Several studies of diabetes in humans have shown decreased insulin clearance and degradation associated with insulin resistance.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	173	 This was observed in obese hyperinsulinemic individuals and in type 2 diabetes patients (33 to 36), in non-diabetic insulin-resistant individuals (37) and in two different ethnic groups at high risk for diabetes (38,39).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	174	 In contrast, other studies have demonstrated an increased insulin clearance and degradation associated with diabetes (40,41).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	175	 However, increased insulin degradation seems to be associated with insulin deficiency as such and, in both type 2 diabetes patients and in streptozotocin diabetic rats, increased degradation can be restored by insulin treatment (41,42).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Increased insulin degradation in target tissues could therefore also be a secondary event in diabetes to compensate for impaired insulin secretion.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	177	Furthermore, genetic linkage has been reported between type 2 diabetes and the distal region of chromosome 10q, close to the Ide gene in humans.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	178	 In a Mexican American population, evidence was found for a susceptibility locus on 10q that influenced both type 2 diabetes and age at onset of disease (43).

0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	182	 Presently, we can only speculate about the biochemical mechanisms through which IDE could mediate the insulin resistance phenotype observed in vivo in Niddm1e rats, in fat cells as well as the blunted insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle from Niddm1e.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	183	 However, previous studies of rats and humans have implied that both insulin receptor internalization and receptor recycling defects are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes (36,46,47).
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Possibly, a decreased intracellular degradation of insulin bound to its receptor would inhibit receptor-mediated signal transduction, by lowering the number of available receptors on the cell membrane and/or compromising the downstream signaling from the receptor.
0.24092752.10958757.html.plaintext.txt	185	 In addition to an effect on insulin receptor recycling and signaling, reduced IDE activity may also have a diabetogenic effect through its ability to degrade peptides sharing a hydrophobic motif (48), that has similarities to a motif common to amyloid-forming peptides (49).

0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	11	Method Recall tests consisting of two short stories were administered to 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 10 normal subjects.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	12	 The two stories were identical except for one passage in each story: one was emotionally charged (arousing story) and the other (neutral story) was not.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	13	Results In both groups, the emotionally charged passage in the arousing story was remembered better than the counterpart in the neutral story.

0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although memory impairment is a central and prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of emotion on memory in this illness has not been well studied.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	19	 We previously found that most of the patients with Alzheimer's disease who encountered a terrible earthquake remembered what happened around the time of the earthquake better than a less emotional event, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study that they underwent, which suggests that fear reinforces memory retention in Alzheimer's disease (Ikeda et al, 1998).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, because the study design involved a naturalistic approach, it was difficult or impossible to control for some factors of the target events, other than the emotional impact of the event, which could have influenced memory retention.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	21	 To re-evaluate our previous finding of an enhancement of declarative1 memory for emotional material in Alzheimer's disease, we conducted the present strictly controlled experimental study.

0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	107	 REFERENCES   A paradigm for emotionally influenced memory Although both naturalistic and experimental approaches have merits, experimental studies have obvious advantages in the control of experimental variables and the assessment of the accuracy of memory.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	108	 In our strictly controlled experimental study, we could control factors other than emotional impact which influenced memory retention, such as the content, complexity and comprehensibility of the target events, and the style and time of exposure to them.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In addition, because the current paradigm was a more natural one, involving a connected series of pictured events, rather than a randomly ordered series of photographs, potential artefacts due to presenting a random selection of pictures were eliminated.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	110	 Therefore, not only was the current paradigm a strictly controlled one, but it was able to assess the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on declarative memory in a condition close to daily life.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	111	Emotionally influenced memory in Alzheimer's disease In the present study, the rating of the emotional charge of the arousing story was significantly higher than that of the neutral story, in both the Alzheimer's patients and the normal subjects, reconfirming that both groups were similarly more emotionally charged by the arousing story than by the neutral story.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	112	 The Alzheimer's disease patients recalled less about the stories than did the normal subjects, for both stories.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	113	 A phase-by-phase comparison of the results in each group showed that the arousing story was better recalled than the neutral story only in phase 2, in which the emotional impact in the arousing story was greater than that in the neutral one.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	114	 These results strongly indicate that the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on declarative memory is preserved in patients with Alzheimer's disease, although the memory function itself in such patients was poorer than in normal subjects.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	115	Magnitude of enhancement From a neuroanatomical viewpoint, the amygdala is considered to play a crucial role in emotionally influenced memory (Cahill et al, 1996, 1998; Hamann et al, 1999).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	116	 Adolph et al (1997) demonstrated the failure of the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on memory in patients with bilateral damage to the amygdala, using the same emotional memory paradigm that was used in the current study.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	117	 In our previous study we reported that emotional remote memory about a terrible earthquake was significantly more closely correlated with the volume of the amygdala than with the volume of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's patients, indicating that the impairment of the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on memory in these patients is related to the degree of damage to the amygdala (Mori et al, 1999).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	118	 That study also indicated that in some Alzheimer's patients, arousal material failed to enhance memory.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	119	 However, in the present study, the magnitude of the enhancement of memory in Alzheimer's patients by emotional material was as good as that in normal subjects.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	120	One possible reason for this discrepancy might be the difference in the severity of dementia in the target subjects.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	121	 In the patients in the present study, dementias were milder than those in our previous study, as rated by the CDR.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	122	 The volume of the amygdala decreased and the neuropathological changes in that region increased with increasing CDR score (Jack et al, 1997; Haroutunian et al, 1998).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	123	 Because more of the amygdala was probably preserved in the patients in this study than in those in our previous study, those in the present study might have had a greater memory for emotional material.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	124	Another possible reason for this discrepancy might be the easiness of the current recall test.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	125	 The recall test in the present paradigm was made easier to enable us to assess the memory function fairly and to avoid the floor effect in Alzheimer's disease.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	126	 Consequently, the recall test might have become too easy for the normal subjects, and a ceiling effect might have occurred in phase 2 for the arousing story in the normal subjects, which would have artificially decreased the degree to which the arousing story enhanced their memory.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	127	Clinical implications of emotionally influenced memory The finding that emotional arousal enhanced memory in Alzheimer's disease has implications for the management of people with dementia.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	128	 It directly suggests that they should be treated gently, to avoid eliciting strong negative feelings.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	129	 Although Alzheimer's patients forget less emotional events, they have a better memory for emotionally negative events, and this might damage the caregiver patient relationship, for example.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	130	 Although the emotional arousal used in the present study was negative in nature, both positive and negative emotional arousal have similar memory-enhancing effects (Hamann et al, 1997b).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	131	 In consideration of our finding, together with this evidence of Hamann et al, it is suggested that the instructions and guidance given to Alzheimer's disease to patients may be easier to remember if emotionally arousing actions, devices and so on are used.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	132	The present finding also implies a potentially useful strategy for memory rehabilitation.
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	133	 Furthermore, the fact that emotional arousal enhances memory raises the possibility of enhancing memory without emotional arousal, by using agents such as the ss-adrenergic receptor agonist and the corticosterone receptor agonist, which involve the final emotion memory pathway (Cahill et al, 1998).
0.2947801.11116776.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Clearly, more research is needed to determine the association between emotion and memory and to develop a useful strategy for memory enhancement.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received July 25, 1997; Revised and Accepted August 2, 1997.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	4	The APOE [epsis]4 allele is a strong genetic susceptibility factor for Alzheimer's disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Interaction with other biological factors may modulate the effect of the apoE isoforms.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, previous work suggested that other genetic variability within the APOE locus, influencing the effect of the [epsis]4 allele, may exist.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Such variability could modify the expression of the APOE gene and, in particular, the level of expression of APOE alleles could be an important determinant of disease pathogenesis.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	8	 To test this hypothesis we examined the levels of expression of APOE in heterozygotes with AD and in controls, using a new method of semi-quantitation.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We report that relative [epsis]4 mRNA expression is increased in AD compared with controls and suggest that genetic variability in the neural expression of APOE contributes to disease risk.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	10	The [epsis]4 allele of the APOE gene is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) (1), and is also implicated as a risk factor for early-onset disease in some populations (2,3).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Previous studies have described [epsis]4 homozygotes as having a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	12	 However, individuals bearing one or two [epsis]4 alleles, do not inevitably develop the disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Detailed genetic analysis around the APOE locus has suggested the existence of other genetic variability in this region which could contribute to disease risk (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	14	 There are two possible explanations for these observations: (i) there is another genetically variable locus in the vicinity of the APOE gene involved in the pathogenesis of the disease; (ii) there is a genetic variability in the control of expression of the APOE gene (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	15	There has been little examination of the mRNA expression of APOE in AD (5,6).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	16	 The available evidence suggests that APOE expression is increased by neuronal damage (7,8) and that the bulk of the expression occurs in astrocytes (5).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This expression is believed to be part of a compensatory mechanism aimed at aiding reafferentation and reactive synaptogenesis (9).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Only a few studies have examined the expression of the apoE protein in AD cases and controls relative to the APOE genotype (9,10).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	19	 have suggested that the amount of apoE protein could be inversely correlated to the number of [epsis]4 alleles carried by subjects: higher levels were observed in [epsis]3 homozygotes, lower in [epsis]4 homozygotes and intermediate levels in [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes (10).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	20	We hypothesised that, since [epsis]4 homozygotes have a higher risk of developing disease than [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygotes, and a high proportion of individuals with the latter genotype reach a greater age without developing AD, a likely explanation of this was that there was genetic variability in neural expression at the APOE locus and that [epsis]3[epsis]4 heterozygote individuals who were high [epsis]4 expressors and/or low [epsis]3 expressors were more likely to develop AD than individuals with high [epsis]3 expressors and/or low [epsis]4 expressors.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	21	The identification of the APOE allele transcription products is easily achieved by RT-PCR, using restriction fragment length polymorphism.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	22	 We developed a semi-quantitative assay to measure allelic expression of APOE mRNA by RT-PCR using silver staining (11).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	23	 This method of quantitation has been applied to brains of heterozygote subjects collected at various centres and used to assess the percentage of [epsis]4 mRNA expression in [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 subjects and [epsis]2 mRNA expression in [epsis]2[epsis]3 individuals.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	24	 This has been carried out both in AD cases and controls.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	25	We selected a series of [epsis]3[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]4, [epsis]2[epsis]3 AD cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 12) in order to measure the relative level of expression of the APOE allele in the frontal cortex (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	26	 We observed that [epsis]3 mRNA expression was consistently greater than [epsis]4 mRNA expression in all cases (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	27	 In addition, there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls (Fig.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	28	 2), with AD cases showing a higher relative expression of [epsis]4 mRNA than controls (34.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Regarding the other heterozygous genotypes, the small size of each group prevented us from reaching any definite conclusion.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Nevertheless, a trend towards the same situation as observed in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 group could be noted, an increase in the expression of the [epsis]4 allele in the [epsis]2[epsis]4 group (42.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	31	2% in the only control), whereas nothing was apparent in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 group (39.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	32	4% in the only AD case versus 45.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	33	 Furthermore, a difference in the allelic expression ratio between [epsis]2[epsis]4 and [epsis]3[epsis]4 AD cases was observed, since [epsis]2[epsis]4 patients showed a 1.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	34	25-fold increase of the [epsis]4 allele ratio (P = 0.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	38	 The [epsis]2 mRNA percentage was measured in the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population and the [epsis]4 mRNA percentage in the [epsis]3[epsis]4 and [epsis]2[epsis]4 population.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	39	 The average level of expression is indicated by a bold line in each category.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	40	 For each brain sample, RT-PCR and semi-quantitation was repeated three times.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	41	It is important to note that measurement of the ratio of expression of the two alleles in heterozygotes is likely to be a much more robust measurement than the determination of absolute levels of mRNA expression in the same tissue, since the latter will be profoundly affected by post-mortem delay, agonal state and cell population and density.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	42	As can be seen in Figure 2, the level of expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than that of the [epsis]4 allele in the AD group as well as in the control group.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	43	 These data suggest that there is either differential stability of the different mRNA species, or that there is genetic variability in the expression of the two alleles in disequilibrium with the coding polymorphism.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	44	 However, in addition there was a clear and consistent difference in the [epsis]4 allelic expression ratio between AD cases and controls.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	45	 These results are consistent with the notion that part, at least, of the genetic risk of developing AD encoded at the APOE locus relates to the expression of this protein in the brain.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	46	 It would seem that heterozygote individuals who express a relatively high proportion of the [epsis]4 allele are at greater risk for developing disease than those expressing a relatively low proportion.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	47	 The observation that the different alleles of APOE are not equally expressed may be of importance in the formulation of hypotheses relating to the role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD in general.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	48	 At present, there is much speculation and experimentation designed to determine the nature of the role of the different alleles of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	49	 As previously suggested, the E4 isoform may facilitate (12) or not limit (13) the amyloid substance deposition.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	50	 This isoform would not protect against oxidative stress, conversely to the E2 isoform (14).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Finally, it has been suggested that the E2 and E3 isoforms may prevent the aggregation of Tau protein, while the E4 isoform may not prevent the paired helical filament formation (15).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	52	 However, these hypotheses are based on the premise that the APOE allele isoforms are equally expressed and present at similar concentrations in the brain.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	53	 These isoform-specific differences could be enhanced by a different representation of each isoform in an individual.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	54	To date, it seems difficult to link APOE mRNA and apoE protein levels.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	55	 Several studies had explored this issue reporting contradictory findings in brain (10,16), cerebrospinal fluid (17,18) and plasma (19).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	56	 But even if the apoE level was tested according to the APOE genotype, none of the previous studies have been able to determine the relative ratio between the different isoforms and thus our results are not comparable with them.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	57	 The development of isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies would help to determine whether the variation that is observed in our population is also present at the protein level (20).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	58	There are two major findings in our work.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	59	 First, that the expression of the [epsis]3 allele is consistently higher than the expression of the [epsis]4 allele.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Second, that the expression of the [epsis]4 allele beyond a certain level seems to greatly influence the vulnerability of an individual to Alzheimer's disease.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	61	It is interesting to note that APOE is up-regulated as a consequence of an insult.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	62	 showed an increase in the level of expression of APOE mRNA in rat after lesioning of the cerebral cortex (6).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	63	 showed that APOE mRNA was increased in AD brains (5).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Together these results support an event, which may lead to an increase of the APOE mRNA and, in parallel, a distortion of the allelic expression.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The distortion of the allelic expression may be specific to brain, and possibly restricted to certain areas (21).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	66	 This suggests a neural genetic susceptibility for AD associated with the APOE gene.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	67	Interestingly, Templeton reached a similar conclusion using a cladistic analysis of our previously reported genetic data (4).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Using haplotype data from markers surrounding the APOE locus, including the APOE polymorphism, Templeton showed that the coding polymorphism in the APOE gene was not sufficient to explain the increased risk for AD (22).
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Our data suggest that the influence of non-coding polymorphism on ApoE expression may supply the rest of the answer.

0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	99	--> No[epsis]4 mRNA and No[epsis]3 mRNA were the initial number of the [epsis]3 and [epsis]4 mRNAs.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	100	 [alpha][prime][epsis]4 mRNA and [alpha][prime][epsis]2 or [epsis]3 mRNA were the coefficients allowing silver staining, and the phenomenon of saturation due to this staining, to be integrated and normalised.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	101	 A is a coefficient of proportionality, correcting for the length difference between each restriction fragments.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	102	 After digestion by CfoI, the [epsis]3, [epsis]2 and [epsis]4 alleles can be characterised by 91, 83 and 72 bp fragments, respectively.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	103	 The A coefficient is therefore calculated as A = 91/72 for [epsis]3[epsis]4 individuals, A = 83/72 for [epsis]2[epsis]4 individuals and A = 91/83 for the [epsis]2[epsis]3 population.
0.2476838.9328480.html.plaintext.txt	104	Because both [epsis]2 and [epsis]3 alleles give a restriction length fragment at 91 bp, AOD[epsis]2 mRNA + OD[epsis]3 mRNA = OD91 bp.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	25	 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS REFERENCES   Although there has been controversy about the relative importance of plaques versus tangles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that altered metabolism of Ass peptides and amyloid deposition in neuritic plaques causes Alzheimer's disease by triggering a complex pathological cascade that produces dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	26	 The Ass peptides Ass1-40 and Ass1-42, the two major species of Ass, are generated from APP by sequential proteolytic cleavage by ss- and - secretases.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	27	 These enzymes are not the only ones involved in the breakdown of APP: -secretase cleaves the full-length APP, producing soluble sAPP and, subsequently, p3.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Because processing by -secretase precludes production of full-length Ass peptides, it is anti-amyloidogenic (Younkin, 1998).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several lines of evidence suggest that deposition of Ass-42 is an important initial step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	30	 Ass1-42 aggregates more rapidly and is deposited earlier in Alzheimer's disease plaques than Ass1-40 (Iwatsubo et al, 1994).

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in this population requires both documentation of clinically significant decline in cognitive and adaptive competence from previously attained levels of performance and documentation of the absence of any other condition that might cause declines in performance (Aylward et al, 1997).
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	40	 Both these requirements are particularly difficult to address for adults with Down's syndrome, given their lifelong intellectual disability.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	41	 The wide range of premorbid levels of performance associated with differences in level of intellectual disability requires specific criteria for clinically significant decline indicative of dementia for each level of function, and these are just beginning to be developed.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	44	The neuropathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome have been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for APP located on chromosome 21 (Rumble et al, 1989) and the increased risk of dementia in Down's syndrome may be mediated by an increased substrate for cellular production of Ass peptides.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	45	 Recent neuropathological studies have shown that diffuse plaques, the most prevalent Alzheimer-type lesion seen in individuals with Down's syndrome before age 50, are not associated with dementia.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Diffuse plaques contain non-fibrillar amyloid, appear at younger ages than do neuritic plaques, are not associated with neuronal degeneration, and do not appear to affect the structure and function of neurons.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	47	 In contrast, increases in the numbers of neuritic plaques, containing substantial amounts of fibrillised Ass peptides, are observed in adults with Down's syndrome predominantly after 50 years of age and are associated with neuronal degeneration and loss of function (Wisniewski, T.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Examination of the age-specific prevalence of dementia in Down's syndrome supports the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease in Down's syndrome are closely associated with the development of these fibrillised plaques (Lai  and  Williams, 1989; Visser et al, 1997; Holland et al, 1998; Lai et al, 1999) (see Fig.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Although prevalence studies have employed varying sampling and diagnostic methods, there is remarkable agreement across studies that risk of Alzheimer's disease increases primarily after 50 years of age.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	50	 In addition, not all adults with Down's syndrome will develop dementia even if they reach ages when the presence of high densities of neuritic plaques can be presumed.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Thus, while triplication of the gene for APP may serve to increase diffuse plaques in adults with Down's syndrome, factors distinct from APP triplication must account for individual differences in susceptibility to the formation of fibrillised plaques and for the wide range in age at onset of dementia.

0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	151	 An important task for future work will be to identify the sources of individual variation in premorbid Ass levels.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Since 95% of people with Down's syndrome have triplication of APP associated with free trisomy, overexpression of APP cannot account for the differences in age at onset of dementia within this population.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	153	 Rather, the joint effects of a variety of factors, including those reviewed here and others not yet identified, must influence the development of Alzheimer's disease.
0.22522588.11983636.html.plaintext.txt	154	 This suggests that we will need to focus on younger adults with Down's syndrome to identify causes of individual differences in lifespan development and to determine when they begin to exert their effects.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	12	 In this study, Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze longitudinal data from 1,262 elderly subjects without dementia at baseline (1991 to 1996) who were followed for an average of 4.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	18	 The adjusted relative risk of stroke-associated dementia in persons with diabetes was 3.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Among Blacks and Hispanics, approximately one third of the risk of stroke-associated dementia was attributable to diabetes (33% (95% CI: 31, 36) and 36% (95% CI: 33, 37), respectively), as compared with 17% (95% CI: 13, 22) among Whites.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	23	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Dementia and diabetes mellitus are two of the most prevalent problems in the elderly.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	24	 More than 10 percent of people over the age of 65 years develop dementia, and the prevalence of dementia increases to more than 50 percent for people over the age of 85 (1, 2).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	25	 More than 10 percent of the elderly suffer from diabetes, and the prevalence is increasing (3, 4).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Dementia and diabetes are more common among Blacks and Hispanics (3 to 7), and there are differences in the predictive ability of known risk factors for dementia across ethnic groups (5, 8 to 12).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	27	The association between diabetes and vascular dementia may depend on the presence of subclinical cerebrovascular disease or frank stroke (13 to 15), and it may be mediated through traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, specifically hyperlipidemia and hypertension (16 to 18).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	28	 The relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is less obvious, although a role for glycated end products in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been hypothesized (19, 20).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	29	Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated an association between a history of diabetes and cognitive deficits (21, 22) and dementia (23 to 26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	30	 The finding of an associa- tion between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease has been inconsistent.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	31	 Two reports from the Rotterdam Study showed a relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, with relative risks of 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	32	3 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The relative risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects treated with insulin was higher than that among subjects treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (compared with subjects without diabetes) in one of those studies (23), while in the most recent report from the same cohort, the risk of Alzheimer's disease was elevated only among diabetic subjects treated with insulin, and risk was not elevated among subjects treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	34	 One study from Rochester, Minnesota (24) reported a doubling of the risk of Alzheimer's disease among men with diabetes as compared with men without diabetes (relative risk = 2.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	35	3) and a non-statistically significant increased risk among women (relative risk = 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Another study of a British cohort also reported a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without it, with a relative risk of 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	37	 In these studies, the relative risk of Alzheimer's disease was lower than that for overall dementia and vascular dementia, and risk was attenuated once cases with stroke were excluded.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	38	The incidence of vascular dementia varies considerably depending on the criteria used (27); if cases of vascular dementia are classified as Alzheimer's disease, the finding of a weak relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may be due to misclassification.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	39	 One study that used more sensitive criteria for the detection of vascular dementia found no association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: The relative risks of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with diabetes as compared with subjects without diabetes were 0.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	40	72) when the researchers considered 25-year history of diabetes and 15-year history of diabetes, respectively (28).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	41	 Thus, the finding of a relation between diabetes and dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, may depend on the criteria used to define vascular dementia and the accuracy of the diagnostic procedures employed.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	42	 None of the previous studies examining the relation between diabetes and dementia included large numbers of Blacks or Hispanics.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	43	The objective of this study was to clarify the association between diabetes and the different types of dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	44	 Because the prevalence of diabetes in Blacks and Hispanics is higher than that in Whites (3, 4), we also examined whether this difference could account for the higher risk of dementia reported in non-Whites (5 to 7).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	45	   MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   Study population Participants in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project cohort were drawn by random sampling of healthy Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years residing within a geographically defined area of northern Manhattan (New York City).

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	47	 Each subject underwent an in- person structured interview of health and function at the time of study entry, followed by the completion of a standard medical history, physical and neurologic examinations, and a battery of neuropsychological tests (29).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	48	 The subjects were recruited between 1991 and 1996 and were followed annually; the evaluations used at baseline were repeated at each follow-up.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	50	 Persons who had completed at least 1 year of follow-up were included in the analysis.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	51	 Of the 2,126 persons who underwent the baseline assessment, 327 persons were excluded because of prevalent dementia and 537 persons were not available for follow-up (141 had died and 396 refused follow-up or had moved).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	52	 The 537 excluded persons were slightly older than the analytical sample (mean age = 78 years vs.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	53	 75 years), were similar with regard to gender and ethnic distributions, and had a lower prevalence of diabetes (14 percent vs.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	55	Diagnosis of dementia and cognitive impairment The diagnosis of dementia and assignment of its specific cause was made by a group of neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists by consensus, on the basis of information gathered at the initial visit and follow-up visits.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	56	 Dementia diagnosis was based on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (30), and it required evidence of cognitive deficits on the neuropsychological test battery as well as evidence of impairment in social or occupational functioning (Clinical Dementia Rating  > 0.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	57	 Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) (32).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Diagnosis of dementia associated with stroke (hereafter called stroke-associated dementia) was made in all subjects with dementia in whom stroke was judged to be the main cause of the dementia based on evidence of the focal effects of the stroke, its temporal relation with dementia, or both.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Brain imaging was available in 85 percent of cases of stroke; in the remainder, World Health Organization criteria were used to define stroke (33).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	60	 Subjects without dementia but with a history of stroke at the baseline examination were included in the analyses.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	61	 A diagnosis of cognitive impairment without dementia (hereafter called nondementia cognitive impairment) was made if neuropsychological testing detected memory impairment that was more than one standard deviation lower than normal for the subject's age but the individual reported no impairment or only mild impairment in social or occupational activities (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	62	Diagnosis of diabetes and other covariates The presence of diabetes was based on reported use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents or a clinical history of diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	63	 Hypertension, heart disease, and smoking were based on self-report or clinical history.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	64	 Ethnic group was based on self-report using the format of the 1990 US Census (34).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Individuals were asked whether they were of Hispanic origin.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	66	 Subjects were then assigned to one of three ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	68	 Apolipoprotein E genotyping was obtained by amplification of genomic DNA with polymerase chain reaction subjected to CfoI restriction analysis using apolipoprotein E primers and conditions similar to those described by Hixson and Vernier (35).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	69	 Fasting plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined at the initial assessment using standard enzymatic techniques.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	70	 High density lipoprotein cholesterol was determined after precipitation of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid (36).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	71	 Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were calculated using the formula of Friedewald et al.

0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The relations between diabetes and nondementia cognitive impairment with and without stroke paralleled the relations of diabetes to stroke-associated dementia and Alzheimer's disease, respectively.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	136	 The population attributable risk for diabetes in relation to stroke-associated dementia varied by ethnic group; it was approximately twice as great in Hispanics and Blacks as in Whites.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	137	The risk of vascular dementia increases greatly with stroke (13, 14), and this may be caused by large and small vessel disease (18, 41), both of which are associated with diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	138	 It is likely that diabetes affects the risk of vascular dementia partly by contributing to dyslipidemia and hypertension.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	139	 Hyperlipidemia and hypertension have been reported by other investigators to be associated with vascular dementia (17, 41 to 43), and these associations were also present in our data.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	140	 The strong though statistically nonsignificant hazard ratio for stroke-associated dementia in diabetic persons (as compared with nondiabetic persons) among subjects with stroke (hazard ratio = 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	141	1) suggests that diabetes contributes to risk of stroke-associated dementia through additional mechanisms.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	142	 One such mechanism that has been proposed is diabetes-related impairment in cerebral vasoreactivity, with accompanying changes in blood flow (44, 45).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	143	The mechanisms underlying the possible association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease remain unclear.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	144	 One possibility is the production of glycation end products (19, 20).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	145	 However, reductions in plasma amyloid precursor protein have been reported with elevation of plasma levels of glucose and insulin (46), and insulin has been reported to decrease ss-amyloid neurotoxicity in vitro (47).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	146	 These findings raise the possibility that hyperinsulinemia, one of the characteristics of type II diabetes, may decrease the deposition of amyloid protein in the brain, which is a key step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (48 to 53).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	147	 The mechanisms underlying the weak relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease remain to be clarified.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	148	Three longitudinal studies have reported an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, among persons with diabetes (23 to 26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	149	 Two of these studies used NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (23, 25, 26); one showed that risk of Alzheimer's disease was lower than risk of overall dementia in persons with diabetes (25), and the other showed that risk of Alzheimer's disease in such subjects was decreased by excluding subjects with stroke, although the risk remained significant (26).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	150	 The third study used the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, for the diagnosis of dementia, based on medical record review and autopsy data (24).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	151	 These studies had a limited ability to detect vascular dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	152	 The definition of vascular dementia is controversial; depending on the criteria used, the incidence of vascular dementia can vary severalfold (27).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	153	 If cases of stroke-associated dementia are misclassified as cases of Alzheimer's disease, risk factors for stroke-associated dementia can appear to predict Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	154	 One study that used NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the criteria of the California state Alzheimer's disease diagnostic and treatment centers for the diagnosis of vascular dementia found a relation of diabetes with vascular dementia but not with Alzheimer's disease (28).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	155	The criteria of the California Alzheimer's disease diagnostic and treatment centers are the most sensitive for the diagnosis of vascular dementia (27) and would therefore classify fewer cases of stroke-associated dementia as cases of Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	156	 Thus, it appears that the relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease is sensitive to the criteria used to define vascular dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	157	 We addressed this issue by reclassifying all subjects with Alzheimer's disease who had also had a stroke as subjects with stroke-associated dementia (including cases in which the temporal relation between dementia and stroke was unclear), but the hazard ratios in this analysis remained essentially unchanged.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	158	 The criteria for the diagnosis of stroke-associated dementia used in the last analysis are consistent with those of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) (54).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The NINDS-AIREN criteria are not as sensitive in the detection of vascular dementia as the California criteria used in the study that found no relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (27).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	160	 However, misclassification of cases of stroke-associated dementia as cases of Alzheimer's disease is an unlikely explanation for our finding of a relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease: The results were unchanged both with exclusion of stroke cases from the analyses and with the reclassification of dementia subtypes described above.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	161	 The finding of a slightly greater risk of Alzheimer's disease among subjects using insulin than among those using oral hypoglycemic agents is consistent with findings from the Rotterdam Study (23, 26) and may reflect the possibility that diabetic subjects who used insulin had more severe or prolonged diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	162	We performed additional analyses using nondementia cognitive impairment as an outcome; these analyses yielded results similar to those for dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	163	 There are inconsistent reports of an association between diabetes and cognitive impairment (21, 22, 55).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	164	 Subjects with cognitive deficits and no functional disability have been determined to be at higher risk of dementia (40).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	165	 Thus, the association between diabetes and cognitive impairment would be expected to be similar to that between diabetes and dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	166	 The findings for nondementia cognitive impairment support the results of the main analyses.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	167	One explanation for our finding of a nonsignificant weak association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease may be that a relation truly exists but this study lacked statistical power to detect it.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	168	 Our analysis using the composite outcome of Alzheimer's disease and nondementia cognitive impairment without stroke, showing a statistically significant association with diabetes as compared with the absence of diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	169	10), is consistent with this interpretation.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	170	 Another possible explanation for this nonsignificant finding is that misclassification error for diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or both may have diluted the relation between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	171	 Self-reported diabetes as used in this study almost certainly underestimated the true prevalence of diabetes; true prevalence has been reported to be twice the prevalence of self-reported disease when subjects with undiagnosed diabetes are considered (3).
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	172	This study had important strengths.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	173	 It was a longitudinal study of nondemented elderly subjects in three ethnic groups that used standardized procedures for the diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes in a prospective fashion.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The main limitations of the study were a lack of data on duration of diabetes, severity of diabetes, and the presence of undiagnosed diabetes.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	175	 The multivariate models assumed a lifetime duration of exposure, which could have resulted in error in the measurement of exposures such as diabetes, lipid levels, and hypertension.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	176	 However, as we noted above, this did not appreciably affect the hazard ratios for diabetes in relation to Alzheimer's disease and stroke-associated dementia.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	177	The findings of this study support those of previous longitudinal studies that reported a weak association between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and a strong association between diabetes and stroke-associated dementia, and they extend these observations to minority population groups.
0.26019153.11581097.html.plaintext.txt	178	 The population attributable risk for diabetes in relation to stroke-associated dementia was significantly greater in Blacks and Hispanics than in Whites.

0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	3	Received May 26, 1999; Accepted June 1, 1999.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	4	Despite being considered the archetypal non-genetic neurological disorder, genetic analysis of Parkinson's disease has shown that there are at least three genetic loci.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	5	 Furthermore, these analyses have suggested that the phenotype of the pathogenic loci is wider than simple Parkinson's disease and may include Lewy body dementia and some forms of essential tremor.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	6	 Identification of [alpha]-synuclein as the first of the loci involved in Parkinson's disease and the identification of this protein in pathological deposits in other disorders has led to the suggestion that it may share pathogenic mechanisms with multiple system atrophy, Alzheimer's disease and prion disease and that these mechanisms are related to a synuclein pathway to cell death.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Finally, genetic analysis of the synuclein diseases and the tau diseases may indicate that this synuclein pathway is an alternative to the tau pathway to cell death.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	8	Parkinsonism is the term used to describe a constellation of clinical signs which includes resting tremor, rigidity, gait disturbance and postural instability, along with other `secondary' features.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	9	 The most common form of parkinsonism is Parkinson's disease (PD).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	10	 This disorder is pathologically characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies [intracellular inclusions staining with both [alpha]-synuclein and ubiquitin antibodies (1) in the brain stem], associated neuronal loss and notable depigmentation of the substantia nigra.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	11	 Importantly, Lewy bodies are also found in other diseases, such as some Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases (2) and some prion diseases (3).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	12	 As the eponym indicates, Lewy bodies are the hallmark pathological finding in Lewy body dementia (LBD) (4); whether this is a disease on one end of a spectrum of Lewy body diseases, including in its range PD and LBD, or is a distinct clinicopathological entity is the subject of current debate (discussed below).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	13	 Synuclein abnormalities also occur in the parkinsonian disorder multiple system atrophy (MSA).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	14	 In this disease there is abnormal oligodendroglial staining with synuclein antibodies, but no Lewy bodies (5).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	15	 Parkinsonism is also a feature of other diseases that are characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular lesions consisting of the tau protein).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	16	 These include: progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (6); bodig (Parkinson's dementia complex of Guam) (7); frontal-temporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (8).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	17	 In addition, there are recessive disorders in which parkinsonism is a feature: these include `juvenile' parkinsonism (AR-JP, for which mutations in the parkin gene on chromosome 6 have been identified as responsible) (9); and lubag, an X-linked recessive parkinsonism-dystonia complex seen on the Philippine island of Panay (10).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	18	 These latter are not reviewed herein.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	19	The primary purpose of this article is to review recent progress in the genetics of those diseases in which synuclein pathology is a prominent feature.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	20	 However, it is clear that both the etiology and clinical features overlap with those of diseases with tau pathology, so relevant recent information on these diseases will be briefly discussed.

0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	23	 In PD, LBD and MSA the synuclein pathology is the predominant and possibly primary pathology, whereas in AD and the prion diseases the synuclein pathology is, we will argue, secondary to other lesions that lead to extracellular protein deposition.

0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	27	PD was for many years considered the archetypal `non-genetic' disorder, however, a re-evaluation and meta-analysis of twin studies suggested that genetic factors had an important part to play (11).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	28	 Cross-sectional surveys have shown that early onset PD (arbitrarily designated as 12) (this issue is further discussed below).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	29	 However, limited longitudinal evaluation of twins with late onset PD, by 18F-dopa positron emission tomography, suggests that cross-sectional studies are overlooking pre-symptomatic disease (13).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	30	 In addition, several families in which apparently autosomal dominant disease has been well-documented (14-19) offer the classic route to the identification of pathogenic loci.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	31	In 1996, Polymeropoulos and colleagues identified genetic linkage to Lewy body parkinsonism in the Contursi kindred (15,20).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The [alpha]-synuclein gene had previously been mapped into the region defined by the linkage study (21).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The following year they reported a mutation, A53T, which segregated with the disease in the family (22).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	34	 This mutation has subsequently been identified in several other families, all of whom are of Greek or Southern Italian origin, suggesting a founder effect (22,23).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	35	 A second mutation, A30P, has been described in a single family of German origin (24).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	36	 Both [alpha]-synuclein mutations appear to be almost fully penetrant (22,23).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The identification of these pathogenic mutations was particularly interesting and surprising for two reasons.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	38	 First, because most species, including mouse, have a threonine at codon 53 and thus the pathogenic mutation can be thought of as a `revertant' (although there are other differences between the human and mouse sequence; 25).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	39	 Second, because a fragment of [alpha]-synuclein (the non-amyloid component of plaques, NAC) was suggested to be part of the pathology of AD, although this has not been confirmed (26).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	40	 The identification of [alpha]-synuclein as a gene for Lewy body parkinsonism led immediately to the realization that [alpha]-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (27).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	41	The normal function of [alpha]-synuclein is unknown (28); however, a role in synaptic transport of vesicles or in synaptic plasticity has been suggested (29).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	42	 It is not known whether the pathogenic mutations inhibit this function (although there is some suggestion that they might; 29).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	43	 However, in vitro data suggest that the mutant protein is more prone to fibrillogenesis (30-33).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	44	 This has led to the idea that fibrillogenesis of the mutant protein is the key feature which leads to pathogenesis.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	45	Most families multiply affected by Lewy body parkinsonism do not have a lesion in the [alpha]-synuclein gene (25).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	46	 Two other loci have been reported for Lewy body parkinsonism: the first on chromosome 2p (34) and the second on chromosome 4p (35).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	47	 These loci are not fully penetrant with respect to Lewy body parkinsonism; indeed, in both cases, it seems that only about half the gene carriers develop the disease (34,35).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	48	 Furthermore, it is also clear that even these three loci together ([alpha]-synuclein, ch2p and ch4p) do not account for the majority of the familial cases of Lewy body parkinsonism.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	49	 Thus, ironically, it seems likely that there will be at least four, and probably more, genetic loci for a disease that was considered `non-genetic'.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	50	Multiple loci encoding the parkinsonian phenotype is one level of complexity in the genetics of this disorder, but the situation is, in fact, more complex than this in two related ways: first, the loci are non-penetrant; secondly, the neurodegenerative disease phenotype encompasses more than simple parkinsonism.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	51	Non-penetrance of PD loci and the occurrence of essential tremor as an alternative phenotype.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	52	All three genetic loci so far identified by linkage analysis are incompletely penetrant.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	53	 Part of the biological reason for this is probably that loss of ~70% of nigral neurons is required for expression of the parkinsonian phenotype (36).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	54	 Thus, individuals with a loss of neurons of less than this amount will appear unaffected.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	55	 This is also, almost certainly, part of the reason why twin studies (which by their nature are largely cross-sectional) fail to show high degrees of concordancy in monozygotic twins (12; see ref.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	56	 13 for a discussion of this issue).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	57	 However, the fact that PD is a disease with a distinct clinical threshold is not the whole explanation of non-penetrance since, in the ch4p-encoded family, the onset of disease is typically ~40 years with death at 50 years, yet unaffected haplotype carriers have a normal life expectancy (16,17,35).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	58	 Thus, it seems likely that other factors, possibly also genetic, modify the expressivity of this locus.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	59	 Interestingly, and related to this, most of the haplotype carriers of the ch4p locus who do not develop neurodegenerative disease have essential tremor.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	60	 This is a relatively benign and non-progressive tremor clinically distinct from the resting tremor of PD (37).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	61	 While this is a surprising finding, it is not unprecedented, in that essential tremor has frequently been reported to occur more frequently in the relatives of individuals with PD (38,39).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	62	The relationship between PD and LBD: alternative phenotypes of the same process.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	63	As discussed briefly above, PD is a distinctive clinical entity whose symptoms are largely dependent on the lesion of the substantia nigra.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	64	 However, Lewy body degeneration occurs in other parts of the brain in PD.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	65	 Furthermore, a proportion of individuals develop dementia in which their sole cortical pathology is the occurrence of Lewy bodies (4,40).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	66	 From a clinical perspective, this syndrome, LBD, consists of progressive dementia as the core feature, with fluctuations in cognition, hallucinations and parkinsonism.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	67	 Patients with LBD may be particularly prone to developing, or progressive severity of, parkinsonism, when exposed to neuroleptic medication and may be dramatically responsive to cholinesterase inhibitors.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	68	 The relationship between LBD and PD is not clear, largely because the etiologies of both disorders individually are unclear.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	69	 However, the family in which the ch4p locus segregates includes some individuals who fit the clinical criteria for PD and others who fit the criteria for LBD (17; unpublished data).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	70	 Thus it is the authors' opinion that LBD and PD share the same etiology and pathogenic mechanisms and differ only in the neuronal populations affected by disease.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	71	MSA is a sporadic, late onset (typically 50-65 years) disease whose clinical presentation overlaps with PD, but in which autonomic failure is a pronounced feature and in which cerebellar signs such as ataxia may occur (41).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	72	 It is characterized by neuronal loss and by the occurrence of oligodendroglial inclusions; these inclusions stain positive for [alpha]-synuclein (42).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	73	 No risk factors, either genetic or environmental, have yet been identified for MSA.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	74	The genetics of the diseases in which [alpha]-synuclein is the secondary pathology.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	75	A well-established observation has been the occurrence of Lewy bodies in individuals with neuritic plaques, often in the absence or near absence of the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (2).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	76	 However, with the advent of molecular genetic analysis of families with AD, it has become clear that Lewy bodies occur in families with either amyloid precursor protein (APP) (43,44) or presenilin (44,45) mutations.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	77	 This indicates that in this circumstance Lewy body/synuclein pathology is a consequence of the primary pathology in APP processing.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	78	 This surprising observation has been extended to the prion diseases, in which, in those prion families in which neurofibrillary tangles were previously reported, the advent of synuclein antibodies has also revealed the occurrence of Lewy bodies (3,46).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	79	 In addition, with respect to AD at least, it seems as if the tangle/tau pathology and the Lewy body/synuclein pathology are alternative responses to the primary lesion, because cases of AD with little tau pathology have much synuclein pathology and vice versa (47).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	80	The genetics of the diseases with tau pathology.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	81	Neurofibrillary tangles are most frequently thought of in connection with AD, however, there is a long list of neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonism and tangle pathology (48).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	82	 Most notable are pathological data from chromosome 6q-linked juvenile onset parkinsonism (AR-JP) (9,49).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	83	 While devoid of Lewy body inclusions, there is prominent neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus with tau staining of neurofibrillary tangles in cerebral cortex and brainstem nuclei (50).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	84	 The number of different mutations described in the parkin gene will ultimately provide insight into both the protein's function and resultant clinical and pathological presentations.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	85	 Also of relevance to this review are FTDP-17 (51), in which the pathogenic mutations are within the tau gene (52,53), and PSP.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	86	 Work on FTDP-17 and the relationship between this disease and AD has recently been reviewed (54,55).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	87	 However, progress on the etiology of PSP has occurred since these reviews and will thus be discussed herein.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	88	PSP is the second most common cause of parkinsonism (56).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	89	 It is characterized by the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of straight filaments comprising almost entirely of tau in which the deposited protein contains four microtubule-binding repeats (57).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	90	 In contrast, in AD both three and four repeat tau is deposited (54,55).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	91	 Families with multiple cases of PSP have not been convincingly demonstrated and thus genetic factors were not thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	92	 However, Saitoh and colleagues showed a robust association between homozygosity of a common allele at a dinucleotide repeat marker and PSP that has been multiply confirmed (58).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	93	 Recently this association was shown to reflect the occurrence of common tau haplotypes that differ in gene structure, but not in protein coding sequence, and that homozygosity of the common allele (H1) predisposes to disease (59).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	94	 It is not yet clear whether there has been a mutation on the H1 background that predisposes to disease or whether the H1 haplotype itself is a `low penetrance' risk factor locus with a recessive mode of inheritance.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	95	 The absence of families with multiple cases of PSP would seem to provide evidence against the existence of a rare highly penetrant mutation that is associated with some versions of the H1 haplotype.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	96	 The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in PSP that are made of four repeat tau indicates that, whatever the pathogenic process in this disease, it results in the selective deposition of these isoforms.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	97	 This is similar to missense mutations and 5[prime] splice site mutations that affect exon 10 of the tau gene and which are associated with the development of FTDP-17.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	98	 Thus the most parsimonious explanation of the genetic data in PSP is that the H1 haplotype prediposes to the over-production of four repeat tau, which somehow initiates the pathogenic process.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	99	SUMMARY, SYNTHESIS AND SPECULATION.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	100	The clinical and pathological presentations of parkinsonism, both synucleinopathies and tauopathies, overlap and argue that the underlying defects may perturb relatively few common pathways for which there are a limited number of pathological responses (60).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	101	 One rationale to understand these disorders is to identify the underlying genetic influences that result in different synuclein pathologies, in PD, LBD and MSA.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	102	 Identifying the proteins, their interactions and the pathways affected will direct future epidemiological studies into environmental risk factors and the exploration of gene-environment interactions.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	103	 Our task is to: (i) delineate which genetic methods will be most powerful to identify the underlying molecular components; (ii) identify the normal function of the defective proteins implicated in disease; and (iii) understand how those proteins and pathways are regulated and integrated.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	104	 Despite the apparently low heritability suggested by cross-sectional twin studies (12), linkage analysis, with the caveats of reduced penetrance, variable expressivity and phenocopy, is proving a successful method with which to identify loci, genes and mutations leading to parkinsonism (8-10,20,22-24,34-35,49-53,57-59).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The proteins identified may also be central to idiopathic PD (1).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Limited family studies now suggest that the etiology of parkinsonism is multifactorial in which several susceptibility genes/mutations are involved.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	107	 Given this conclusion, it is not surprising (with the exception of PSP; 57-59) that the majority of case-control studies for candidate gene associations have not proved reproducible.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	108	 The problem lies not just with ascertainment or issues of misdiagnosis/under-diagnosis or in looking at the right candidate gene, but rather it is the underlying, naive assumption that disease in a sample is likely to originate from the same, common, founder mutation.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	109	 This may be true in isolated populations, such as Finland or Iceland, where linkage disequilibrium mapping has proven powerful in diseases with simple, single gene etiologies, but is unlikely to hold true for idiopathic PD and the majority of studies.
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	110	 From the limited components identified to date, it is possible to speculate that these proteins may functionally overlap in a common pathway of cytoskeletal maintenance and intracellular vesicle transport (20,22,28,29,51-53,58).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	111	 Identification of the susceptibility genes at ch2p, ch4p and other loci may lend support to this hypothesis (34,35).
0.22751856.10469843.html.plaintext.txt	112	 Hence, after >180 years, molecular genetic analysis of familial parkinsonism will finally allow us to refine the nosology that James Parkinson so carefully documented (61).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	5	 We also show that IDE can promote the in vivo production of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a function normally attributed to the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	6	 However, IDE cannot substitute for the function of Axl1p in promoting haploid axial budding and repressing haploid invasive growth, activities that require an uncharacterized activity of Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	7	 Particulate fractions enriched for Axl1p or Ste23p are incapable of cleaving insulin, suggesting that the functional conservation of these enzymes may not be bidirectionally conserved.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	8	 We have made practical use of our genetic system to confirm that residues composing the extended zinc metalloprotease motif of M16A family enzymes are required for the enzymatic activity of IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	9	 We have determined that IDE and Axl1p both require an intact C terminus for optimal activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	10	 We expect that the tractable genetic system that we have developed will be useful for investigating the enzymatic and structure/function properties of IDE and possibly for the identification of novel IDE alleles having altered substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	11	   INTRODUCTION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES   The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE1; EC 3.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	12	56 [EC] ) has broad substrate specificity, being able to cleave and inactivate a number of small molecules, including the A peptides and insulin (1 to 3).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	13	 In animal models, IDE deficiency correlates with increased levels of insulin and A and increased risks of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease (4 to 6).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	14	 Despite these and other findings, the biological role of IDE and its importance in the clearance of insulin and A remains to be fully clarified (7).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	15	The Ste23p and Axl1p proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have significant sequence homology to IDE (36 and 19% identity, respectively) (8).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	16	 Genetic and mutational studies indicate that Ste23p and Axl1p are required for the proteolytic maturation of the yeast a-factor mating pheromone, a lipid-modified peptide that is produced by a multistep process (9, 10).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	17	 This pheromone is produced by MATa haploid cells and is required for yeast mating, the fusion of MATa and MAT haploid cells to form a diploid cell.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	18	 Although Ste23p and Axl1p can independently promote a-factor maturation, the enzymes are not fully redundant.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	19	 Ste23p is significantly less efficient than Axl1p at producing biologically active pheromone (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	20	Axl1p has several cellular roles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	21	 In addition to its role in pheromone production, Axl1p is required for the efficient post-conjugation fusion of haploid mating partners (11).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	22	 This role may be indirectly related to the ability of Axl1p to produce a-factor, because limiting levels of pheromone similarly lead to fusion defects (12).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	23	 Axl1p is also required for maintenance of the axial budding pattern that is characteristic of haploid yeast (8, 9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	24	 In the absence of Axl1p, haploid yeasts exhibit a bipolar budding pattern that is typical of diploid cells.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	25	 The function of Axl1p in this process does not require its proteolytic activity, suggesting that Axl1p is a bi-functional enzyme (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	26	 Axl1p also represses the invasive growth of haploid yeast (13, 14).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	27	 Whether the proteolytic, bud site selection, or another activity of Axl1p is required for this process has not been reported.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	28	 By contrast to Axl1p, the only reported cellular role for Ste23p is in a-factor production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	29	 Additional functions for this enzyme are likely because Ste23p is expressed in both the MAT and diploid cell types that do not produce a-factor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	30	IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p are members of the M16A protease subfamily.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	31	 M16A proteases are characterized by a core inverted zinc metalloprotease motif that is typically located within the first 200 residues of these enzymes and a pair of glutamic acid residues that are 70 and 77 amino acids distal to the core motif (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	32	 The spacing between the core motif and the distal glutamates is invariant for all 46 M16A enzymes identified so far, except in the case of Axl1p where the spacing is 76 residues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	33	 The histidine residues and most distal glutamate residue are putative zinc ligands, and mutational alteration of these residues inactivates IDE and Axl1p (9, 15, 16).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	34	 Some members of the M16A subfamily, including IDE, are sensitive to thiol modifiers, suggesting that a cysteine residue(s) is critical for proper structure of the active site or the overall tertiary or quaternary structure of these proteins (1, 15).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	35	 Sequence alignment of IDE and its yeast orthologs reveals two conserved cysteine residues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	36	 One is within the core metalloprotease motif, and this residue can reportedly be altered without affecting enzymatic activity (15).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	37	 The other conserved cysteine is exactly 67 amino acids distal to the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6EX67C).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	38	 This distal cysteine is not conserved in Escherichia coli Protease III, a bacterial M16A enzyme that is insensitive to thiol modifiers (17).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	39	The sequence similarity between IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p has prompted us to investigate the hypothesis that these proteins have conserved enzymatic properties and substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	40	 To this end, we present evidence indicating that rat IDE can substitute for Axl1p and Ste23p in a-factor production but not for the other known functions of Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	41	 More importantly, these findings establish yeast as a genetically tractable system for future studies of IDE function.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	42	 We have made practical use of this system to create and characterize novel mutations that alter the enzymatic properties of IDE.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	52	  The general strategy for the epitope tagging of AXL1, STE23, and IDE encoding plasmids involved the creation of a novel restriction site at the end of the respective open reading frame and subcloning of a triply iterated HA tag.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	53	 pWS371 (CEN URA3 AXL1-2HA) was created by modifying p80 as follows.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	54	 An NcoI site was inserted immediately prior to the stop codon of AXL1 into which a DNA fragment encoding a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; in actuality, two tandem copies of the tag were inserted.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	55	 The plasmid was further modified to delete a portion of the 5'-untranslated region corresponding to an XhoI fragment in order to reduce the overall size of this plasmid from 12.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	56	6 kb; this deletion had no effect on protein expression.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	57	 pWS482 (CEN URA3 STE23-2HA) was created by modifying p137 in a similar manner to that described for p80.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	58	 In this instance, a BamHI site was introduced immediately prior to the stop codon of STE23 into which a triply iterated HA tag was inserted; as with pWS371, two tandem copies of the tag were actually inserted.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	59	 pWS511 (2 micro URA3 PPGK-IDE-HA) was created by PCR amplification of IDE from pSR-rat IDE such that the PCR product had ends homologous to the parent yeast vector (pSM703) and a BglII restriction site immediately before the stop codon of IDE (21).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	60	 The BglII site was used for insertion of the triply iterated HA epitope tag.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	61	 pWS496 is identical to pWS511 except that it contains two copies of the triply iterated HA tag.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	62	 Restriction digest analysis and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the presence of the tag in each of the plasmids described above.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	63	The general strategy for the creation of site-directed mutations in the above plasmids also involved PCR-directed recombination-mediated plasmid construction.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	64	 In brief, a DNA fragment encoding an appropriate segment of the target open reading frame was amplified by PCR where one of the oligonucleotides contained the mutation of interest and typically a silent restriction site.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	65	 The DNA fragments were co-transformed with a target plasmid that had been linearized or gapped with restriction enzymes near the intended site of mutation.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	69	The epitope tagging of Ste23p was not straightforward.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	70	 DNA sequencing of an intermediate plasmid in the construction pWS482 revealed an extra nucleotide near the 3' end of the open reading frame that was not present in the public sequence of STE23.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	71	 The presence of the extra nucleotide was confirmed in the STE23 sequence derived from three different sources: p137 and PCR products derived from chromosomal amplification of the STE23 gene from two distinct strain backgrounds (IH1783 and YPH499).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	72	 An independent group (22) has proposed recently the identical sequence annotation as part of an effort to identify mistakes in published genome sequences.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	73	 The extra nucleotide alters and extends the translation of the STE23 open reading frame such that amino acids 971 to 988 now code for 18 distinct amino acids and an additional 39 amino acids are gained as an extension to the original proposed translation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	74	Protein Extract Preparations Whole cell protein extracts for Western analysis were prepared by the NaOH/trichloroacetic acid method (23).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	99	 The supernatant containing insulin fragments was transferred to a new tube, and the radioactivity associated with the supernatant and particulate fractions was determined using a Wallac -counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	100	Yeast Mating Assay To evaluate the ability of plasmid-transformed MATa axl1 ste23 strains to promote a-factor production, patch mating tests were performed using IH1793 (MAT lys1) and established methods (26).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	101	 This test provides an indirect assessment of M16A enzyme function because a-factor production in the MATa cells is entirely dependent on the plasmid-encoded copy of the M16A enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	102	 In brief, master plates were prepared by patching MATa yeast strains expressing Axl1p, Ste23p, or IDE onto YEPD agar plates.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	103	 After 2 to 3 days of growth, the patches were replica-printed onto lawns of MAT cells (IH1793) spread on minimal media agar plates, and the replica-printed plates were incubated for 2 days at 30  degrees C.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	104	 The MAT cell suspensions were prepared to approximately the same cell density in solutions of 1, 10, or 100% YEPD, which were prepared as mixtures of YEPD and the appropriate amount of sterile H2O.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	105	 The trace amount of YEPD added to the minimal media allows for limited survival of the auxotrophic haploid cells, which is necessary for the mating process.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	106	 Decreasing the YEPD amount shortens the survival window of the haploid cells and thus results in decreased mating efficiency.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	107	 The diploid cells that result from mating events are prototrophic, and thus the growth of diploids in this test is indicative of mating and a functional M16A enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	108	Mass Spectroscopy The a-factor mating pheromone produced by yeast expressing IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p was purified according to published methods and analyzed by mass spectroscopy (26).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	109	 In brief, yeast were cultured in polypropylene culture tubes, and the a-factor secreted from the yeast cultures was recovered by washing the polypropylene culture tubes with methanol; secreted a-factor adsorbs to polypropylene and can be removed with organic solvents.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	113	 The enriched samples were dried by a speed-vac and resuspended in 50  microl of MeOH.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	114	 2-Fold serial dilutions of the samples prepared in YEPD were spotted onto a lawn of RC757 (MAT sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2) or RC631 (MATa sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2 rme ade2-1 ura1) cells; the latter served as a control for the unlikely possibility that a toxic product was being produced by the IDE-expressing strain (27).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	115	 The formation of a spot in the lawn is indicative of the presence of pheromone in the sample, and the relative potency of pheromone can be determined from the serial dilutions of the sample.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	116	 The highest dilution having biological activity is referred to as the end point and is equivalent to a concentration of 12 pg/ microl of a-factor (28).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	134	 Bud scars on 100 cells were evaluated and categorized into three patterns: axial, bipolar, and random.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	135	 The axial pattern was defined as bud scars located solely at one pole of the cell; the bipolar pattern had scars at both poles, and the random pattern displayed at least one bud scar in the region between both poles (8, 9).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	137	 Thus, we hypothesized that IDE could rescue the mating defect of a strain lacking Axl1p and Ste23p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	138	 Prior to evaluating the ability of IDE to substitute for the functions of the yeast M16A enzymes, we first determined whether yeast could be used for the heterologous expression of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	139	 We created plasmids encoding epitope-tagged versions of the genes encoding IDE and its yeast orthologs.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	140	 For all the proteases, a DNA fragment encoding the HA epitope tag was placed at the 3' end of each gene.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	141	 The addition of this tag did not alter the activities of these enzymes (see Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	142	Evaluation of protein extracts from strains expressing the tagged proteases revealed that each tagged protein could be detected as a protein of the expected size by immunoblot (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	143	 We also observed that IDE and Ste23p were expressed at 10 times higher levels than Axl1p as determined by comparison of immunoblot signals.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	144	 The constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was used to drive IDE expression, so the abundant expression of IDE was not unexpected.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	145	 Native promoters were used to drive Ste23p and Axl1p expression, and the relative abundance of Ste23p over Axl1p was somewhat unexpected, especially because Ste23p does not promote a-factor production as efficiently as Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	146	 Thus, the reason for the decreased ability of Ste23p to promote mating cannot be simply attributed to reduced protein expression by comparison to Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	147	IDE Is Associated with a Particulate Yeast Fraction The subcellular distribution of IDE in mammalian systems is reported to be primarily cytosolic, with extracellular and peroxisomal localizations also being described (35, 36).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	148	 To ascertain the effect of heterologous expression on the subcellular distribution of IDE, we subjected a total yeast lysate to differential fractionation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	149	 By comparison of equal amounts of loaded protein by immunoblot, we observed that IDE and the yeast M16A enzymes were highly enriched in the particulate fraction associated with 16,000 x g centrifugation of the lysate (P16), although a significant amount of Ste23p was found in the supernatant fraction (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	150	 In this particular experiment, Axl1p was encoded on a multicopy plasmid to facilitate its detection, hence its stronger signal relative to that observed in total extracts (see Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	151	Although the localization of Ste23p has not been reported previously, Axl1p is known to transiently associate with components that form a sub-plasma membrane complex that is required for establishing bud sites.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	152	 Whether IDE or Ste23p can assemble into this complex is unknown.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	153	 To better understand the nature of association that IDE, Axl1p, and Ste23p have with the P16 yeast fraction, we performed extractions of the particulate fraction with various chaotropic agents (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	154	 Our analysis revealed that high pH and detergent treatments significantly disrupted the association of these proteins with the P16 fraction, whereas salt and buffer alone had a minor impact.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	155	 This profile is consistent with IDE, Ste23p, and Ax1p being peripheral membrane proteins and/or components of a large macromolecular complex that sediments under our experimental conditions.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	156	Yeast-expressed IDE Retains Proteolytic Activity We next determined whether yeast-expressed IDE could cleave insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, using a previously described insulin degradation assay and yeast-derived particulate fractions (4, 25).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	157	 Because of the high degree of enrichment for M16A enzymes in yeast particulate fractions, these samples were used exclusively as the source of activity for these in vitro assays.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	158	 Our analysis of enzymatic activity indicated that the IDE-containing samples had insulin cleaving activity, whereas samples containing Axl1p or Ste23p had no more activity than a sample prepared from yeast lacking these enzymes (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	159	 The source of the residual activity in these preparations is unknown but is likely due to a nonspecific enzymatic activity rather than that of an additional IDE homolog because 1,10-phenanthroline, a well documented IDE inhibitor, does not inhibit the residual activity (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	160	 Whether the Axl1p and Ste23p proteases in these preparations are incapable of cleaving insulin because of altered substrate specificity, sub-optimal reaction conditions, or other reasons has not yet been determined.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	161	IDE is described as a thiol- and zinc-dependent metalloprotease (35).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	162	 Having determined that IDE can be heterologously expressed in a functional form, we next wanted to confirm that the observed insulin degrading activity detected had the hallmarks of IDE-mediated insulin degradation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	163	 We examined the effect of alkylating (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	164	 iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide) and metal ion-chelating agents (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	165	 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA) on IDE activity (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	166	 Alkylating agents inhibited IDE-dependent insulin degrading activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	167	 An inhibitory effect was also observed for 1,10-phenanthroline but not with the nonchelating agent 4,7-phenanthroline that is structurally similar.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	168	 EDTA did not measurably inhibit enzymatic activity; extensive pretreatment with EDTA is reportedly required for inhibition of IDE (15).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	169	 The inhibitor profile observed for insulin degrading activity in yeast was identical to that reported for IDE, which further establishes that yeast can synthesize IDE possessing all the enzymatic properties described for that of IDE found in metazoans (35).

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	172	 A, particulate fractions were isolated from yeast expressing IDE, Axl1p, or Ste23p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	173	 An equivalent amount of each fraction (5  microg) was assayed for insulin degradation activity during a time course according to established methods (see "Experimental Procedures").
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	174	 The degradation of insulin is indicated by the presence of recovered insulin fragments that cannot be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	175	 B, the effect of various agents on the activity of yeast-expressed IDE was evaluated.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	176	 Activities were determined as in A, but only for the t = 0-min and t = 120-min time points.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	178	  IDE Can Promote Yeast Mating Many of the yeast enzymes required for a-factor production can be functionally replaced by orthologous enzymes from other species (29 to 34).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	179	 In similar fashion, we have now determined that IDE expression can rescue the mating defect of a yeast strain lacking both AXL1 and STE23 (MATa axl1 ste23) (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	180	 The mating defect in this strain is due to an inability to produce yeast a-factor, but whether Axl1p and Ste23p, and by extension IDE, participate directly or indirectly in pheromone production has not been rigorously established (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	181	 Nevertheless, this result establishes that IDE and the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p can similarly promote yeast a-factor production and thus have an evolutionarily conserved activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	182	 The simplest explanation for our findings is that these enzymes directly participate in pheromone production and that these enzymes have shared substrate specificity with respect to cleavage of the a-factor precursor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	183	Yeast mating is sensitive to a number of variables, including available nutrients.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	184	 Under depleted nutrient conditions, mating is less efficient.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	185	 We have taken advantage of this property of yeast mating to evaluate the effectiveness of IDE in rescuing the mating defect of yeast lacking both Ste23p and Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	186	 As expected, we observed that decreasing nutrient conditions correlated with decreased mating for all strains.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	187	 Ste23p and IDE-expressing strains showed significant reductions in mating relative to the Axl1p-expressing strain (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	188	 Epitope-tagged versions of these enzymes had a similar activity profile in this assay (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	189	 The relatively poor ability of Ste23p to promote mating, with respect to Axl1p, is consistent with previous reports on the properties of this enzyme and may be attributable to a number of factors, including altered substrate specificity and/or an altered subcellular localization pattern that prevents interaction with substrates (9).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	190	 Likewise, the reduced mating observed for IDE may be attributable to similar factors.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	191	 The reduced mating observed for IDE and Ste23p-expressing cells is not simply due to low expression of these enzymes because both are expressed at significantly higher levels than Axl1p (see Fig.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	193	 Yeast-expressed IDE promotes yeast mating and a-factor pheromone production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	194	 A, the mating competence of MATa ste23 axl1 cells transformed with the indicated M16A enzyme encoded on a plasmid was evaluated using a patch mating test.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	195	 The selective growth of diploid cells on the minimal media is indicative of mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	196	 Patch mating tests were conducted using MAT lys1 lawns containing various amounts of nutrients (100, 10, and 1% YEPD; top to bottom).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	197	 Lowering the amount of YEPD in the lawn increases the stringency of the mating test and allows for discrimination of differences in mating efficiency not otherwise observable under permissive mating conditions (100% YEPD).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	198	 B, patch mating tests were conducted as in A but using MATa strains expressing HA-epitope tagged M16A proteases under mildly stringent mating conditions (10% YEPD).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	199	 C, the a-factor produced by each of the strains described in B was recovered from the walls of culture tubes using an organic solvent, and concentrated samples were analyzed by a spot halo test.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	200	 Each strain was grown to saturation in the same volume of media.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	201	 The formation of a spot in the lawn of MAT (RC757) cells is indicative of the presence of pheromone in the sample, and the relative pheromone potency can be determined by serial dilution of the sample.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	202	 The highest dilution having activity is referred to as the end point and is equivalent to a concentration of 12 pg/ microl of a-factor (28).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	203	 D, 2-fold serial dilutions of the IDE sample prepared in YEPD were spotted onto a lawn of RC631 (MATa sst2-1 his6 met1 can1 cyh2 rme ade2-1 ura1) serving as a control for the possibility that a toxic product was being produced by the IDE-expressing strain (27).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	204	 The strains used were IH1783 transformed with pRS316 (wild type (WT)), and Y272 transformed with pRS316 (vector), p80 (AXL1), p137 (STE23), pWS491 (IDE), pWS371 (AXL1-2HA), pWS482 (STE23-2HA), or pWS496 (IDE-2HA).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	205	  The most straightforward explanation for the reduced mating observed with Ste23p and IDE-expressing strains is that these strains have reduced a-factor production by comparison with the Axl1p-expressing strains.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	206	 Thus, we compared the relative amounts of a-factor produced by these strains over the lifetime of a culture.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	207	 We used a bioassay that relies on the natural growth-arrest response of MAT cells to the a-factor pheromone to detect and quantifiably measure a-factor activity in our samples.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	208	 Our analysis revealed that both IDE and Ste23p-expressing strains produce significantly less a-factor than an Axl1p-expressing strain, despite the fact that IDE and Ste23p are significantly overexpressed relative to Axl1p (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	209	 The IDE-derived sample was also bioassayed using MATa cells.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	210	 These cells fail to undergo growth arrest in response to the a-factor pheromone and thus served as a control for the unlikely scenario that IDE-expressing strains were producing a toxic secreted product.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	211	 No growth inhibition of MATa cells was observed with the IDE-derived sample (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	212	The a-factor mating pheromone is an isoprenylated and carboxymethylated dodecapeptide (YIIKGVFWDPAC[farnesyl]methyl).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	213	 Alterations to the chemical form of a-factor (e.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	214	 lipid removal or primary sequence alterations) can impact the function of this pheromone (37).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	215	 For example, a-factor lacking a tyrosine residue has 25% of the biological activity of full-length pheromone as judged by yeast mating tests (37).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	216	 Thus, the reduced production of a-factor pheromone by IDE and Ste23p-expressing yeast could be attributable to cleavage of the a-factor precursor at a site other than the Asn-Tyr cleavage site recognized by Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	217	 To determine whether the pheromone products produced by IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p were identical, we determined the mass of the a-factor species generated by these enzymes using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	218	 Several major species were detected in these samples, including a 1629-Da peak that corresponds exactly to the mass of bona fide a-factor (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	219	 4, A to C; IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p samples, respectively).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	220	 This species was not in the negative control (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	221	 The 1629-Da species was still observed in the samples after the data were de-isotoped (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	222	 4, E to G) and remained absent in the negative control (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	223	 Based on these observations, we reasoned that the 1629-Da species is indeed a-factor, which implies that IDE, Ste23p and Axl1p have similar cleavage specificities.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	224	Although no other species were apparent in the de-isotoped data for the IDE and Ste23p-derived samples in the indicated mass range, additional species were evident in the other samples.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	225	 In the Axl1p-derived sample, three additional species were observed (1480, 1526, and 1718 Da) (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	226	 One distinct species was observed in the negative control (1587 Da).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	227	 These additional species were not reproducibly detected between experiments.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	228	2 The mass range shown in all panels is inclusive of the masses of the theoretical MFA1-derived a-factor species either lacking an N-terminal tyrosine (1467 Da) or extended by an N-terminal asparagine (1744 Da), but none of the four unidentified species can be matched to these alternative a-factor cleavage products.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	229	 The nature of these other species is therefore unknown.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	230	Genetic Evaluation of IDE Mutants The ability of yeast-expressed IDE to promote a-factor production suggests that yeast mating can be used as a phenotype to evaluate the function of IDE mutant alleles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	231	 To test this hypothesis, we created site-directed and deletion mutations of IDE and tested the ability of these mutants to promote mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	232	 Using our genetic system, we confirmed that residues comprising the core metalloprotease motif (HXXEH) of IDE were essential for promoting mating (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	233	 These residues were required for the activity of Ste23p and Axl1p as well (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	234	 The most distal glutamate of the extended motif (HXXEHX69EX6E) was also determined to be essential for the activity of all three enzymes, whereas the penultimate glutamate was dispensable for Axl1p activity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	235	 The penultimate glutamate is required for the activity of mitochondrial processing peptidase, an M16B protease, and has been proposed to aid in metal coordination of this enzyme (38).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	236	In addition to addressing the importance of established active site residues, we investigated the functional importance of cysteine residues in the function of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	237	 We initially investigated the role of two cysteine residues that are invariably conserved between IDE, Ste23p, and Axl1p (HXCEHX69EX6EX67C), suspecting that one of these residues is the likely target of sulfhydryl-modifying agents that inactivate certain M16A enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	238	 Independent mutations at these residues did not alter the abilities of IDE, Ste23p, or Axl1p to promote mating (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	239	 Mutation of the proximal cysteine of IDE (C110A) reportedly does not alter the thiol sensitivity profile of IDE (15), and similarly, we found that mutation of the distal cysteine of IDE (C257A) had no effect on the thiol sensitivity of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	240	2 We also determined that combining the mutations in one molecule (C110A/C257A) did not alter mating function (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	241	 Moreover, the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers was unaffected.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	242	2 Similar results were observed when other cysteine residues that are conserved between IDE and Ste23p or Axl1p (C819A and C414A, respectively) were mutated (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	243	M16A enzymes are large proteins, typically having a molecular mass in excess of 100,000 Da.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	244	 The metalloprotease motif of M16A enzymes is localized near the N-terminal end of these enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	245	 In the absence of structural data for these enzymes, we sought to determine whether the catalytic domain of IDE was self-contained within the N-terminal portion of the enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	246	 C-terminally truncated forms of IDE were created and evaluated for the ability to promote pheromone production.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	247	 These truncations were created as fusions to GFP, which in and of itself did not alter the ability of IDE to function (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	248	 Systematic deletions of the C terminus of the IDE revealed that relatively short truncations inactivated IDE as judged by yeast mating tests.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	249	 Deletion analysis of Axl1p revealed a similar requirement for an intact C terminus, although the deletion required for Axl1p inactivation was considerably larger (Fig.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	255	 We cannot exclude the possibility that these mutants are nonfunctional because of malfolding or other unknown reasons.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	256	 Evaluation of the Axl1p truncation mutants revealed that these were expressed at levels similar to that of the full-length Axl1p-GFP fusion protein.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	258	 We observed decreased expression for certain truncations, suggesting that the C terminus of IDE, for reasons unknown, is required for normal steady state expression.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	259	 Decreased expression alone cannot account for the loss of activity for IDE, because one nonfunctional truncation (IDE-(1 to 973)) was expressed comparably to the full-length IDE-GFP fusion.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	260	 More importantly, the expression levels observed for all the nonfunctional truncations of Axl1p and IDE, which were encoded on multicopy plasmids, were significantly more than that of the respective full-length fusion encoded on a low copy plasmid, as judged by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that lowered expression alone cannot account for the absence of function in these mutants.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	307	  In this study, we have developed yeast as a tractable genetic model system for studying the functional properties of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	308	 We have determined that yeast can be used to express a functional form of IDE and, more importantly, that IDE can promote a-factor production, an activity normally associated with the yeast enzymes Axl1p and Ste23p that have homology to IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	309	 These results imply that members of the M16A metalloprotease family, to which these enzymes belong, may have shared substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	310	 The fact that all three enzymes can promote a-factor production supports this hypothesis.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	311	 However, our inability to demonstrate insulin cleavage by the yeast enzymes implies that the substrate specificity of Ste23p and Axl1p may be more restricted.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	312	 Whether the yeast enzymes cleave other established IDE substrates is currently under investigation.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	313	 We are also investigating the ability of other M16A enzymes to cleave a-factor, because the studies of these enzymes may benefit from the development of a tractable genetic system.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	314	An additional finding from our study is that IDE is enriched but does not exclusively partition into a yeast particulate fraction.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	315	 We suspect that heterologously expressed IDE is either being incorporated into membranes as a loosely associated peripheral membrane protein or it is assembling into a macromolecular complex that partially sediments under the conditions used for isolation of the particulate fraction.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	316	 Although IDE reportedly associates with peroxisomes, this localization is unlikely under our experimental conditions because we did not impose an induction that is required for the formation of yeast peroxisomes (42).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	317	 Moreover, the putative C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal found in IDE, although potentially functional in yeast, is blocked by an epitope tag in our yeast-expressed enzyme.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	318	 Alternatively, IDE may be associating with other undefined membrane sites.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	319	 Axl1p has been reported to associate transiently with components that form a sub-plasma membrane complex that is required for budding (43).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	320	 Thus, it is also conceivable that IDE is assembling into this complex, but as a nonfunctional component.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	321	 Ultimately, defining the subcellular localization Ste23p may provide insight into the subcellular targeting of IDE because these two enzymes appear more conserved in sequence and enzymatic properties than IDE and Axl1p.

0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	338	 Neither Cys-257, which is found near the end of domain I, nor Cys-414, which is found at the beginning of domain IV, are within conserved motifs.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	339	  The genetic model system that we have developed should have far reaching utility for the characterization of mutant IDE alleles.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	340	 We have provided a practical example of this utility by detailing the functional importance of residues that compose the extended metalloprotease motif (HXXEHX69EX6E).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	341	 In addition, our mutational study allows us to make certain conclusions about the cysteine residue(s) that imparts the sensitivity of IDE to thiol modifiers.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	342	 Provided that a single cysteine residue is the target of thiol modification in IDE, our study excludes as targets the two cysteine residues that are invariably conserved between all three enzymes (Cys-110 and Cys-257 in IDE) and two cysteines that are semi-conserved between IDE and the yeast M16A enzymes (Cys-414 and Cys-819 in IDE).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	343	 The double C110A/C257A mutant also remains sensitive to thiol modifiers.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	344	 We are currently developing an in vitro assay for monitoring the activities of Ste23p and Axl1p.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	345	 We expect a determination of whether these enzymes are sensitive to thiol modifiers to aid in the final identification of cysteine residues that are targeted by thiol modifiers in this enzyme family.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	346	 As a second practical example of the utility of our genetic system, we demonstrate for the first time that a C-terminal region is required for the activity of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	347	 In the absence of structural information for IDE, we suspect that its C-terminal region may be required for stabilizing the overall tertiary or possibly quaternary structure of IDE or its active site.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	348	Our genetic system will also be useful for investigating the role of other residues in the function of IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	349	 For example, several conserved sequence motifs can be identified by multiple sequence alignment of M16A enzymes (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	350	 Our future studies will be aimed at determining whether these motifs are important for the function of M16A enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	351	 In addition, we will investigate whether E.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	352	 coli Protease III can support a-factor production in yeast.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	353	 If so, our system could conceivably be used to investigate the structure/function relationships for this enigmatic protease, which also lacks a defined cellular role (44).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	354	Another potential utility of our genetic model system is the theoretical ability to rapidly identify IDE mutants having altered substrate specificity.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	355	 We have already demonstrated that our system is amenable to screening specific mutant IDE alleles for the ability to promote mating.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	356	 The same approach could be used to identify IDE mutants having altered specificity toward the a-factor.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	357	 We envision a positive genetic selection that takes advantage of the observations that IDE-dependent mating is essentially nonexistent at reduced nutrient levels (Fig.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	358	 Under these highly stringent mating conditions, yeast harboring IDE mutants could be screened with the expectation that those having enhanced a-factor production would now be mating-competent.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	359	 These IDE mutants would represent candidates having improved a-factor recognition (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	360	 altered substrate specificity).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	361	 Conceivably, these mutants might also have altered specificity for insulin and/or A.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	362	 IDE mutants having enhanced activity toward these substrates could potentially be used as therapeutic agents for diabetes or Alzheimer disease.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	363	Our data clearly demonstrate that the Axl1p/Ste23p-dependent step in a-factor production can be supported by IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	364	 This result, in and of itself, is not surprising given the high degree of similarity between these enzymes.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	365	 Of greater curiosity is the observation that all the yeast enzymes required for a-factor production can be functionally replaced by their mammalian counterparts.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	366	 The first three steps associated with a-factor production (i.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	367	 isoprenylation, CaaX proteolysis, and carboxymethylation) are part of the biosynthetic pathway of isoprenylated proteins, such as Ras and RhoB.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	368	 The subsequent two proteolytic steps associated with a-factor production have no analogous counterparts in mammals.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	369	 Thus, the ability of mammalian enzymes to promote these latter steps is entirely serendipitous, or it reflects the existence of an orphan biosynthetic pathway that integrates all the steps associated with a-factor biosynthesis.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	370	 If the latter, by analogy, we suspect that the molecule produced by this pathway would serve as a secreted signaling molecule, possibly functioning to regulate cell-cell fusion events such as those that occur during the development of certain tissues.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	371	 Curiously, the morphological and biochemical differentiation of L6 myoblasts into myotubes has been reported to involve IDE (45, 46).
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	372	 Thus, by analogy to a-factor production, we hypothesize that a role of IDE in these cells might be to produce a signaling molecule derived from a precursor having an aliphatic amino acid motif and an N-terminal extension that is readily cleaved by IDE.
0.5010976.15944156.html.plaintext.txt	373	 Whether such a molecule exists in mammalian systems remains to be determined.
