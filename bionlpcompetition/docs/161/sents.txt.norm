0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	94	However wide confidence intervals around estimates small number studies difficult ascertain whether studies truly equal estimates
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	95	There significant association NSAID use studies incident cases dementia significant association studies cognitive decline used outcome
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	96	Prescription bias might also cause difference
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	97	Incident subjects cognitive decline relatively free cognitive dysfunction baseline incident cases dementia relatively later stage disease
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	98	In earlier stages disease prescription bias might present
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	99	To explore whether prescription bias cause observed association NSAID use Alzheimer disease whether true beneficial effect decided upon randomized clinical trials whose patients without early signs Alzheimer disease 40
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	100	If period NSAID use disease onset relatively short difficult differentiate cause effect
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	101	With short period exposure outcome reduced intake NSAIDs among subjects dementia could also consequence disease
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	102	Four studies 14 16 20 26 tried avoid bias evaluating use acetaminophen control differing patterns drug use demented nondemented subjects
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	103	Many authors argued demented nondemented subjects differ acetaminophen use vary NSAID use NSAIDs must associated better cognitive function
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	104	We think however demented patients might report less pain nondemented subjects NSAIDs first drugs prescribed less frequently
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	105	This means studies prevalent cases likely suffer prescription bias studies incident cases
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	106	Because Alzheimer disease common dementia insidious onset also important know different studies used index date
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	107	All studies prevalent cases took date diagnosis dementia three studies incident dementia cases took date first symptoms disease 17 21 24 seven studies incident dementia cases used date diagnosis dementia
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	108	The three studies date onset symptoms used similar relative risk estimates seven studies date diagnosis used
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	109	Some publications used meta analysis originate one cohort

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	126	We could chosen include study reported Rozzini et al

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	128	This would resulted lower pooled relative risk

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	132	The five studies used cognitive decline endpoint used different cognitive measures
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	133	Hence cannot exclude NSAIDs might beneficial effect specific cognitive domain
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	134	However average effect use NSAIDs cognitive decline null consistent finding randomized trials far shown beneficial effect course dementia measured cognitive subscale Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	135	Moreover two studies excluded meta analysis 2 3 relative risk could extracted showed association use NSAID cognitive decline
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	136	A recent meta analysis NSAIDs risk dementia concluded NSAIDs offer protection development Alzheimer disease 41 p
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	137	This conclusion based mainly observation short term users 1 month far less risk reduction long term users 24 months relative risk 0
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	138	These authors address possible confounding factors 42 explain discrepancy studies prevalent cases studies incident cases

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	140	By including studies cognitive decline endpoint thereby creating distance exposure effect demonstrate bias confounding likely explanations observed association
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	141	Traditional teaching holds Alzheimer disease vascular dementia two separate clinical entities differentiated careful clinical necropsy evaluation
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	142	Several recent observations however suggest situation might different
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	143	Vascular risk factors also contribute Alzheimer disease 43 conversely ss amyloid depositions also frequently found subjects vascular dementia 44
0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	144	Hence likely Alzheimer disease vascular dementia two extreme expressions one disease entity dementia 45

0.29792902.15632261.html.plaintext.txt	146	Hence combining comparing various endpoints one analysis gives good indication possible benefits NSAIDs various stages disease

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	147	Third necessary use incident cases dementia disease onset better known

0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	149	Because methodological difficulties previous studies investigated mortality dementia community using incident cases dementia 12 14
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	150	Even studies onset disease difficult assess
0.26308063.11581098.html.plaintext.txt	151	Indeed unless participants screened dementia continuously onset dementia always imprecise clearly insidious onset also interval censoring last time participant considered dementia free first time diagnosed dementia

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	18	Understanding mechanisms amyloid formation fibril formation prevented normal conditions therefore particular interest study Type 2 diabetes
0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	19	Because amylin continually produced non diabetic humans amyloid formation mere presence amylin sufficient cause fibril formation concept supported studies using transgenic mice expressing human amylin 3

0.5293265.10973971.html.plaintext.txt	21	Therefore shift amylin balance either altering synthesis secretion degradation could contribute amyloid formation

0.34450078.11823322.html.plaintext.txt	55	Indeed studies shown late onset disease age onset approximately 6 years earlier individuals carry two copies APOE4 allele compared non carriers
